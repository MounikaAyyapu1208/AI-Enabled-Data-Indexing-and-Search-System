					 To reason is to draw   appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either   or  . An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in the café; therefore he is in the museum,” and of the latter, “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure; therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure.” The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case the truth of the   guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of the   lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute  . Inductive reasoning is common in  , where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in   and  , where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules. There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences: it involves drawing inferences   to the solution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI. Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution. Problem-solving methods divide into special purpose and general purpose. A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded. In contrast, a general-purpose method is applicable to a wide variety of problems. One general-purpose technique used in AI is means-end analysis—a step-by-step, or  , reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal. The program selects actions from a list of means—in the case of a simple   this might consist of PICKUP, PUTDOWN, MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and MOVERIGHT—until the goal is reached. Many   problems have been solved by artificial intelligence programs. Some examples are finding the winning move (or sequence of moves) in a board game, devising mathematical proofs, and manipulating “virtual objects” in a computer-generated world. In   the   is scanned by means of various sensory organs, real or artificial, and the scene is decomposed into separate objects in various spatial relationships. Analysis is complicated by the fact that an object may appear different depending on the angle from which it is viewed, the direction and intensity of illumination in the scene, and how much the object contrasts with the surrounding field. One of the earliest systems to   perception and action was  FREDDY, a stationary robot with a moving television eye and a pincer hand, constructed at the  , Scotland, during the period 1966–73 under the direction of Donald Michie. FREDDY was able to recognize a variety of objects and could be instructed to assemble simple  , such as a toy car, from a random heap of components. At present, artificial perception is sufficiently advanced to enable optical sensors to identify individuals and   vehicles to drive at moderate speeds on the open road. A   is a system of signs having meaning by convention. In this sense, language need not be confined to the spoken word. Traffic signs, for example, form a mini-language, it being a matter of convention that ⚠ means “hazard ahead” in some countries. It is distinctive of languages that linguistic units possess meaning by convention, and linguistic meaning is very different from what is called  natural meaning, exemplified in statements such as “Those clouds mean rain” and “The fall in pressure means the valve is malfunctioning.” An important   of full-fledged human languages—in contrast to birdcalls and traffic signs—is their productivity. A productive language can formulate an unlimited variety of sentences. Large language models like   can respond fluently in a human language to questions and statements. Although such models do not actually understand language as humans do but merely select words that are more probable than others, they have reached the point where their command of a language is indistinguishable from that of a normal human. What, then, is involved in genuine understanding, if even a computer that uses language like a native human speaker is not acknowledged to understand? There is no universally agreed upon answer to this difficult question.

Since the end of the last ice age, humans have developed tools and machines and have modified the land for agriculture and long-term settlement. As the population has grown and new technologies have spread across cultures and continents, more and more of the planet’s resources have been pressed into serving the species. In the process, human activities have disrupted the natural order of the environment by depopulating and eliminating species and adding harmful chemicals to the air, water, and soil—activities that are changing the climate and the structure and function of ecosystems, as well as the biological communities they contain.  Solving the critical environmental problems of global warming, water scarcity, pollution, and biodiversity loss are perhaps the greatest challenges of the 21st century.  Human action has triggered a vast cascade of environmental problems that now threaten the continued ability of both natural and human systems to flourish. Here are four major environmental problems this site will be showcasing. Pollution is one of the most serious problems facing the planet, but it may be one of the easiest to overcome. Learn about how humans cause and can remedy our pollution problems. This crisis poses the most immediate risk to human life and regional stability.

					 The ongoing success of applied AI and   simulation, as described in the preceding sections of this article, seems assured. However, artificial general intelligence (AGI), or strong AI—that is, artificial intelligence that aims to duplicate human   abilities—remains controversial and out of reach. Exaggerated claims of success, in professional journals as well as in the popular press, have damaged its reputation. At the present time even an embodied system displaying the overall intelligence of a   is proving  , let alone a system that can rival a  . The difficulty of scaling up AI’s modest achievements cannot be overstated. Decades of research in symbolic AI have failed to produce any firm evidence that a symbol system can   human levels of general intelligence; connectionists are unable to model the nervous systems of even the simplest  ; and critics of   regard as simply mystical the view that high-level behaviours involving language understanding, planning, and reasoning will somehow emerge from the interaction of basic behaviours such as obstacle avoidance, gaze  , and object manipulation. However, this lack of substantial progress may simply be testimony to the difficulty of AGI, not to its impossibility. Let us turn to the very   of AGI. Can a computer possibly think?   suggests that debating this question is pointless, for it is an essentially   decision whether to extend common usage of the word   to include machines. There is, Chomsky claims, no factual question as to whether any such decision is right or wrong—just as there is no question as to whether our decision to say that airplanes fly is right, or our decision not to say that ships swim is wrong. However, this seems to oversimplify matters. The important question is: Could it ever be appropriate to say that computers think and, if so, what conditions must a computer satisfy in order to be so described? Some authors offer the   as a definition of intelligence. However, Turing himself pointed out that a computer that ought to be described as intelligent might nevertheless fail his test if it were incapable of successfully imitating a human being. For example, ChatGPT continually   its status as a   and thus would be unlikely to pass the Turing test. If an intelligent entity can fail the test, then the test cannot function as a definition of intelligence. It is even questionable whether passing the test would actually show that a computer is intelligent, as the information theorist   and the AI pioneer   pointed out in 1956. Shannon and McCarthy argued that in principle it is possible to design a   containing a complete set of canned responses to all the questions that an interrogator could possibly ask during the fixed time span of the test. Like Parry, this machine would produce answers to the interviewer’s questions by looking up appropriate responses in a giant table. This objection seems to show that in principle a system with no intelligence at all could pass the Turing test. In fact, AI has no real definition of intelligence to offer, not even in the subhuman case.   are intelligent, but what exactly must an artificial intelligence achieve before researchers can claim that it has reached rats’ level of success? In the absence of a reasonably precise   for when an artificial system counts as intelligent, there is no objective way of telling whether an AI research program has succeeded or failed. One result of AI’s failure to produce a satisfactory criterion of intelligence is that, whenever researchers achieve one of AI’s goals—for example, a program that can summarize newspaper articles or beat the world   champion—critics are able to say, “  not intelligence!”  ’s response to the problem of defining intelligence is to maintain—like Turing before him—that intelligence is simply our name for any problem-solving mental process that we do not   understand. Minsky likens intelligence to the concept of “unexplored regions of Africa”: it disappears as soon as we discover it.

						Trusted Britannica articles, summarized using artificial intelligence, to provide a quicker and simpler reading experience. This is a beta feature. Please verify important information in our full article.
					 The approach known as nouvelle AI was pioneered at the MIT AI Laboratory by the Australian   during the latter half of the 1980s. Nouvelle AI distances itself from strong AI, with its emphasis on human-level performance, in favour of the relatively modest aim of  -level performance. At a very fundamental level, nouvelle AI rejects symbolic AI’s reliance upon constructing internal models of reality, such as those described in the section  . Practitioners of nouvelle AI assert that true intelligence involves the ability to function in a real-world  . A central   of nouvelle AI is that intelligence, as expressed by complex behaviour, “emerges” from the interaction of a few simple behaviours. For example, a   whose simple behaviours include collision avoidance and motion toward a moving object will appear to stalk the object, pausing whenever it gets too close. One famous example of nouvelle AI was Brooks’s robot   (named after  ), whose environment was the busy offices of the MIT AI Laboratory. Herbert searched desks and tables for empty soda cans, which it picked up and carried away. The robot’s seemingly goal-directed behaviour emerged from the interaction of about 15 simple behaviours. Nouvelle AI sidesteps the frame problem discussed in the section  . Nouvelle systems do not contain a complicated symbolic model of their environment. Instead, information is left “out in the world” until such time as the system needs it. A nouvelle system refers continuously to its   rather than to an internal model of the world: it “reads off” the external world whatever information it needs at precisely the time it needs it. (As Brooks insisted, the world is its own best model—always exactly up-to-date and complete in every detail.) Traditional AI has by and large attempted to build disembodied intelligences whose only interaction with the world has been indirect (CYC, for example). Nouvelle AI, on the other hand, attempts to build embodied intelligences situated in the real world—a method that has come to be known as the situated approach. Brooks quoted approvingly from the brief sketches that   gave in 1948 and 1950 of the situated approach. By equipping a   “with the best sense organs that money can buy,” Turing wrote, the machine might be taught “to understand and speak English” by a process that would “follow the normal teaching of a child.” Turing contrasted this with the approach to AI that focuses on abstract activities, such as the playing of  . He advocated that both approaches be pursued, but until nouvelle AI little attention was paid to the situated approach. The situated approach was also anticipated in the writings of the philosopher   of the   at Berkeley. Beginning in the early 1960s, Dreyfus opposed the physical symbol system  , arguing that intelligent behaviour cannot be completely captured by symbolic descriptions. As an  , Dreyfus advocated a view of intelligence that stressed the need for a body that could move about, interacting directly with   physical objects. Once reviled by advocates of AI, Dreyfus is now regarded as a prophet of the situated approach. Critics of nouvelle AI point out the failure to produce a system exhibiting anything like the complexity of behaviour found in real insects. Suggestions by late 20th-century researchers that their nouvelle systems would soon be conscious and possess language were entirely premature. In the early 21st century, faster processing power and larger datasets (“big data”) brought artificial intelligence out of the   departments and into the wider world.  , the observation that computing power doubled roughly every 18 months, continued to hold true. The stock responses of Eliza fit comfortably within 50 kilobytes; the language model at the heart of ChatGPT was trained on 45 terabytes of text. The ability of neural networks to take on added layers and thus work on more-complex problems increased in 2006 with the   of the “greedy layer-wise pretraining” technique, in which it was found that it was easier to train each layer of a   individually than to train the whole network from input to output. This improvement in neural network training led to a type of   called “deep learning,” in which neural networks have four or more layers, including the initial input and the final output. Moreover, such networks are able to learn unsupervised—that is, to discover features in   without initial prompting. Among the achievements of deep   have been advances in image classification in which specialized neural networks called convolution neural networks (CNNs) are trained on features found in a set of images of many different types of objects. The CNN is then able to take an input image, compare it with features in images in its training set, and classify the image as being of, for example, a cat or an apple. One such network, PReLU-net by Kaiming He and collaborators at Microsoft Research, has classified images even better than a human did. The achievement of   in beating world   champion   was   by DeepMind’s AlphaGo, which mastered  , a much more complicated game than chess. AlphaGo’s neural networks learned to play go from human players and by playing itself. It defeated top go player Lee Sedol 4–1 in 2016. AlphaGo was in turn surpassed by AlphaGo Zero, which, starting from only the rules of go, was eventually able to defeat AlphaGo 100–0. A more general neural network, Alpha Zero, was able to use the same techniques to quickly master chess and  . Machine learning and AI are foundational elements of   systems. Through machine learning, vehicles are trained to learn from the complex data that they receive to improve the   that they operate under and to expand their ability to navigate the road. AI enables these vehicles’ systems to make decisions about how to operate without needing specific instructions for each potential situation. In order to make   vehicles safe and effective, artificial simulations are created to test their capabilities. To create such simulations, black-box testing is used, in contrast to white-box validation. White-box testing, in which the internal structure of the system being tested is known to the tester, can prove the absence of failure. Black-box methods are much more complicated and involve taking a more adversarial approach. In such methods, the internal design of the system is unknown to the tester, who instead targets the external design and structure. These methods attempt to find weaknesses in the system to ensure that it meets high safety standards. As of 2023, fully autonomous vehicles are not available for consumer purchase. Certain obstacles have proved challenging to overcome. For example, maps of almost four million miles of public roads in the   would be needed for an autonomous vehicle to operate effectively, which presents a   task for manufacturers. Additionally, the most popular cars with a “self-driving” feature, those of  , have raised safety concerns, as such vehicles have even headed toward oncoming traffic and metal posts. AI has not progressed to the point where cars can engage in complex interactions with other drivers or with cyclists or pedestrians. Such “common sense” is necessary to prevent accidents and enable a safe environment. Natural language processing (NLP) involves analyzing how computers can process and parse language similarly to the way humans do. To do this,   models must use  ,  , machine learning, and deep-learning models. Early NLP models were hand-coded and rule-based but did not account for exceptions and   in language. Statistical NLP was the next step, using   to assign the likelihood of certain meanings to different parts of text. Modern NLP systems use deep-learning models and techniques that help them to “learn” as they process information. Prominent examples of modern NLP are language models that use AI and statistics to predict the final form of a sentence on the basis of existing portions. One popular language model was GPT-3, released by   in June 2020. One of the first large language models, GPT-3 could solve high-school-level   problems as well as create computer programs. GPT-3 was the foundation of    , released in November 2022. ChatGPT almost immediately disturbed academics, journalists, and others because of concern that it was impossible to distinguish human writing from ChatGPT-generated writing. One issue with probability-based language models is “hallucinations”: rather than communicating to a user that it does not know something, the model responds with probable but factually inaccurate text based on the user’s prompts. This issue may be partially attributed to using ChatGPT as a   rather than in its intended role as a text generator. Other examples of machines using NLP are voice-operated GPS systems, customer service chatbots, and language translation programs. In addition, businesses use NLP to   understanding of and service to consumers by auto-completing search queries and    . Programs such as OpenAI’s DALL-E, Stable  , and Midjourney use NLP to create images based on textual prompts, which can be as simple as “a red block on top of a green block” or as complex as “a cube with the texture of a porcupine.” The programs are trained on large datasets with millions or billions of text-image pairs—that is, images with textual descriptions. NLP presents certain issues, especially as machine-learning algorithms and the like often express biases   in the content on which they are trained. For example, when asked to describe a doctor, language models may be more likely to respond with “He is a doctor” than “She is a doctor,” demonstrating   gender bias. Bias in NLP can have real-world consequences. For instance, in 2015  ’s NLP program for résumé screening to aid in the selection of job candidates was found to discriminate against women, as women were underrepresented in the original training set collected from employees. Virtual assistants (VAs) serve a variety of functions, including helping users schedule tasks, making and receiving calls, and guiding users on the road. These devices require large amounts of data and learn from user input to become more effective at predicting user needs and behaviour. The most popular VAs on the market are Amazon’s Alexa,  ’s G-Assistant,  ’s Cortana, and  ’s Siri. Virtual assistants differ from chatbots and conversational agents in that they are more personalized, adapting to an individual user’s behaviour and learning from it to improve their service over time. Human-machine communication began in the 1960s with Eliza. However, the first VA was  ’s Simon, developed in the early 1990s. In February 2010 Siri was introduced for  , Apple’s mobile  . Siri was the first VA able to be downloaded to a  . Voice assistants parse human speech by breaking it down into distinct sounds known as  , using an automatic   (ASR) system. After breaking down the speech, the VA analyzes and “remembers” the tone and other aspects of the voice to recognize the user. Over time, VAs have become more sophisticated through machine learning, as they have access to many millions of words and phrases. In addition, they often use the Internet to find answers to user questions—for example, when a user asks for a weather forecast. AI poses certain risks in terms of   and socioeconomic consequences. As more tasks become automated, especially in such industries as marketing and health care, many workers are poised to lose their jobs. Although AI may create some new jobs, these may require more technical skills than the jobs AI has replaced. Moreover, AI has certain biases that are difficult to overcome without proper training. For example, U.S. police departments have begun using predictive policing algorithms to indicate where crimes are most likely to occur. However, such systems are based partly on arrest rates, which are already disproportionately high in Black  . This may lead to over-policing in such areas, which further affects these algorithms. As humans are inherently  , algorithms are bound to reflect human biases. Privacy is another aspect of AI that concerns experts. As AI often involves collecting and processing large amounts of data, there is the risk that this data will be accessed by the wrong people or organizations. With generative AI, it is even possible to manipulate images and create fake profiles. AI can also be used to survey populations and track individuals in public spaces. Experts have implored policymakers to develop practices and policies that maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing the potential risks.

					 ,  the ability of a digital   or computer-controlled   to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the   processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the   in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing  —with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as   as medical  , computer  , voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots. All but the simplest   is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated   behaviour is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger  ,  . When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the  , checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s   is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of  —must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.  generally characterize   not by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities.

					 Expert systems occupy a type of microworld—for example, a model of a ship’s hold and its cargo—that is self-contained and relatively uncomplicated. For such AI systems every effort is made to incorporate all the information about some narrow field that an expert (or group of experts) would know, so that a good expert system can often outperform any single human expert.

If requested, MYCIN would explain the reasoning that led to its diagnosis and recommendation. Using about 500 production rules, MYCIN operated at roughly the same level of competence as human specialists in blood infections and rather better than general practitioners.

					 Samuel’s checkers program was also notable for being one of the first efforts at evolutionary computing. (His program “evolved” by pitting a modified copy against the current best version of his program, with the winner becoming the new standard.) Evolutionary computing typically involves the use of some automatic method of generating and evaluating successive “generations” of a program, until a highly proficient solution evolves. A leading proponent of evolutionary computing,  , also wrote test   for the   of the IBM 701 computer. In particular, he helped design a   “virtual” rat that could be trained to navigate through a maze. This work convinced Holland of the   of the bottom-up approach. While continuing to consult for  , Holland moved to the   in 1952 to pursue a doctorate in  . He soon switched, however, to a new interdisciplinary program in   and information processing (later known as communications science) created by Arthur Burks, one of the builders of   and its successor EDVAC. In his 1959 dissertation, for most likely the world’s first   Ph.D., Holland proposed a new type of computer—a   computer—that would assign each artificial   in a network to a separate processor. (In 1985   solved the   difficulties to build the first such computer, the 65,536-processor Thinking Machines Corporation  .) Holland joined the faculty at Michigan after graduation and over the next four decades directed much of the research into methods of automating evolutionary computing, a process now known by the term  . Systems   in Holland’s laboratory included a   program, models of single-  biological organisms, and a classifier system for controlling a simulated gas-pipeline network. Genetic   are no longer restricted to “academic” demonstrations, however; in one important practical application, a genetic   cooperates with a witness to a crime in order to generate a portrait of the criminal. The ability to reason logically is an important aspect of intelligence and has always been a major focus of AI research. An important landmark in this area was a theorem-proving program written in 1955–56 by   and J. Clifford Shaw of the   and   of the  . The  , as the program became known, was designed to prove theorems from   (1910–13), a three-volume work by the British philosopher-mathematicians   and  . In one instance, a proof devised by the program was more elegant than the proof given in the books. Newell, Simon, and Shaw went on to write a more powerful program, the  , or GPS. The first version of GPS ran in 1957, and work continued on the project for about a decade. GPS could solve an impressive variety of puzzles using a trial and error approach. However, one   of GPS, and similar programs that lack any   capability, is that the program’s intelligence is entirely secondhand, coming from whatever information the programmer explicitly includes. Two of the best-known early AI programs,  Eliza and  , gave an eerie semblance of intelligent conversation. (Details of both were first published in 1966.) Eliza, written by Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT’s AI Laboratory, simulated a human therapist. Parry, written by   psychiatrist Kenneth Colby, simulated a human  . Psychiatrists who were asked to decide whether they were communicating with Parry or a human paranoiac were often unable to tell.  Nevertheless, neither Parry nor Eliza could reasonably be described as intelligent. Parry’s contributions to the conversation were canned—constructed in advance by the programmer and stored away in the  . Eliza too relied on canned sentences and simple   tricks. In the course of their work on the Logic Theorist and GPS, Newell, Simon, and Shaw developed their   (IPL), a computer language tailored for AI programming. At the heart of IPL was a highly flexible   that they called a list. A list is simply an ordered sequence of items of data. Some or all of the items in a list may themselves be lists. This scheme leads to richly branching structures. In 1960   combined elements of IPL with the   (a formal mathematical-logical system) to produce the programming language   (List Processor), which for decades was the principal language for AI work in the  , before it was supplanted in the 21st century by such languages as Python, Java, and C++. (The lambda calculus itself was invented in 1936 by the Princeton logician   while he was investigating the abstract  , or “decision problem,” for   logic—the same problem that   had been attacking when he invented the universal  .) The logic programming language   (Programmation en Logique) was conceived by Alain Colmerauer at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, where the language was first implemented in 1973. PROLOG was further developed by the logician Robert Kowalski, a member of the AI group at the  . This language makes use of a powerful theorem-proving technique known as  , invented in 1963 at the U.S.     in Illinois by the British logician Alan Robinson. PROLOG can determine whether or not a given statement follows logically from other given statements. For example, given the statements “All logicians are rational” and “Robinson is a logician,” a PROLOG program responds in the   to the query “Robinson is rational?” PROLOG was widely used for AI work, especially in Europe and Japan. To cope with the bewildering complexity of the real world, scientists often ignore less relevant details; for instance, physicists often ignore   and   in their models. In 1970   and   of the MIT AI Laboratory proposed that, likewise, AI research should focus on developing programs capable of intelligent behaviour in simpler artificial   known as microworlds. Much research has focused on the so-called  blocks world, which consists of coloured blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface. An early success of the microworld approach was  , written by  Terry Winograd of MIT. (Details of the program were published in 1972.) SHRDLU controlled a robot arm that operated above a flat surface strewn with play blocks. Both the arm and the blocks were virtual. SHRDLU would respond to commands typed in natural English, such as “Will you please stack up both of the red blocks and either a green cube or a pyramid.” The program could also answer questions about its own actions.  Although SHRDLU was initially hailed as a major breakthrough, Winograd soon announced that the program was, in fact, a dead end. The techniques pioneered in the program proved unsuitable for application in wider, more interesting worlds. Moreover, the appearance that SHRDLU gave of understanding the blocks microworld, and English statements concerning it, was in fact an  . SHRDLU had no   what a green block was. Another product of the microworld approach was  , a mobile   developed at the Stanford Research Institute by Bertram Raphael, Nils Nilsson, and others during the period 1968–72. The robot occupied a specially built microworld consisting of walls, doorways, and a few simply shaped wooden blocks. Each wall had a carefully painted baseboard to enable the robot to “see” where the wall met the floor (a simplification of reality that is typical of the microworld approach). Shakey had about a dozen basic abilities, such as TURN, PUSH, and CLIMB-RAMP. Critics pointed out the highly simplified nature of Shakey’s   and emphasized that, despite these simplifications, Shakey operated excruciatingly slowly; a series of actions that a human could plan out and execute in minutes took Shakey days. The greatest success of the microworld approach is a type of program known as an  , described in the next section.

The logic programming language   (Programmation en Logique) was conceived by Alain Colmerauer at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, where the language was first implemented in 1973. PROLOG was further developed by the logician Robert Kowalski, a member of the AI group at the  .

PROLOG can determine whether or not a given statement follows logically from other given statements. For example, given the statements “All logicians are rational” and “Robinson is a logician,” a PROLOG program responds in the   to the query “Robinson is rational?” PROLOG was widely used for AI work, especially in Europe and Japan.

					 Samuel’s checkers program was also notable for being one of the first efforts at evolutionary computing. (His program “evolved” by pitting a modified copy against the current best version of his program, with the winner becoming the new standard.) Evolutionary computing typically involves the use of some automatic method of generating and evaluating successive “generations” of a program, until a highly proficient solution evolves. A leading proponent of evolutionary computing,  , also wrote test   for the   of the IBM 701 computer. In particular, he helped design a   “virtual” rat that could be trained to navigate through a maze. This work convinced Holland of the   of the bottom-up approach. While continuing to consult for  , Holland moved to the   in 1952 to pursue a doctorate in  . He soon switched, however, to a new interdisciplinary program in   and information processing (later known as communications science) created by Arthur Burks, one of the builders of   and its successor EDVAC. In his 1959 dissertation, for most likely the world’s first   Ph.D., Holland proposed a new type of computer—a   computer—that would assign each artificial   in a network to a separate processor. (In 1985   solved the   difficulties to build the first such computer, the 65,536-processor Thinking Machines Corporation  .) Holland joined the faculty at Michigan after graduation and over the next four decades directed much of the research into methods of automating evolutionary computing, a process now known by the term  . Systems   in Holland’s laboratory included a   program, models of single-  biological organisms, and a classifier system for controlling a simulated gas-pipeline network. Genetic   are no longer restricted to “academic” demonstrations, however; in one important practical application, a genetic   cooperates with a witness to a crime in order to generate a portrait of the criminal. The ability to reason logically is an important aspect of intelligence and has always been a major focus of AI research. An important landmark in this area was a theorem-proving program written in 1955–56 by   and J. Clifford Shaw of the   and   of the  . The  , as the program became known, was designed to prove theorems from   (1910–13), a three-volume work by the British philosopher-mathematicians   and  . In one instance, a proof devised by the program was more elegant than the proof given in the books. Newell, Simon, and Shaw went on to write a more powerful program, the  , or GPS. The first version of GPS ran in 1957, and work continued on the project for about a decade. GPS could solve an impressive variety of puzzles using a trial and error approach. However, one   of GPS, and similar programs that lack any   capability, is that the program’s intelligence is entirely secondhand, coming from whatever information the programmer explicitly includes.

					 To reason is to draw   appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either   or  . An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in the café; therefore he is in the museum,” and of the latter, “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure; therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure.” The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case the truth of the   guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of the   lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute  . Inductive reasoning is common in  , where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in   and  , where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules. There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences: it involves drawing inferences   to the solution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI. Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution. Problem-solving methods divide into special purpose and general purpose. A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded. In contrast, a general-purpose method is applicable to a wide variety of problems. One general-purpose technique used in AI is means-end analysis—a step-by-step, or  , reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal. The program selects actions from a list of means—in the case of a simple   this might consist of PICKUP, PUTDOWN, MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and MOVERIGHT—until the goal is reached. Many   problems have been solved by artificial intelligence programs. Some examples are finding the winning move (or sequence of moves) in a board game, devising mathematical proofs, and manipulating “virtual objects” in a computer-generated world. In   the   is scanned by means of various sensory organs, real or artificial, and the scene is decomposed into separate objects in various spatial relationships. Analysis is complicated by the fact that an object may appear different depending on the angle from which it is viewed, the direction and intensity of illumination in the scene, and how much the object contrasts with the surrounding field. One of the earliest systems to   perception and action was  FREDDY, a stationary robot with a moving television eye and a pincer hand, constructed at the  , Scotland, during the period 1966–73 under the direction of Donald Michie. FREDDY was able to recognize a variety of objects and could be instructed to assemble simple  , such as a toy car, from a random heap of components. At present, artificial perception is sufficiently advanced to enable optical sensors to identify individuals and   vehicles to drive at moderate speeds on the open road. A   is a system of signs having meaning by convention. In this sense, language need not be confined to the spoken word. Traffic signs, for example, form a mini-language, it being a matter of convention that ⚠ means “hazard ahead” in some countries. It is distinctive of languages that linguistic units possess meaning by convention, and linguistic meaning is very different from what is called  natural meaning, exemplified in statements such as “Those clouds mean rain” and “The fall in pressure means the valve is malfunctioning.” An important   of full-fledged human languages—in contrast to birdcalls and traffic signs—is their productivity. A productive language can formulate an unlimited variety of sentences. Large language models like   can respond fluently in a human language to questions and statements. Although such models do not actually understand language as humans do but merely select words that are more probable than others, they have reached the point where their command of a language is indistinguishable from that of a normal human. What, then, is involved in genuine understanding, if even a computer that uses language like a native human speaker is not acknowledged to understand? There is no universally agreed upon answer to this difficult question.

The Turing test involves three participants: a computer, a human interrogator, and a human foil.

					 The earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the British logician and computer pioneer  . In 1935 Turing described an abstract computing   consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the  , symbol by symbol, reading what it finds and writing further symbols. The actions of the scanner are dictated by a program of instructions that also is stored in the memory in the form of symbols. This is Turing’s   concept, and   in it is the possibility of the machine operating on, and so modifying or improving, its own program. Turing’s   is now known simply as the universal  . All modern computers are in essence universal Turing machines. During  , Turing was a leading cryptanalyst at the Government Code and Cypher School in  , Buckinghamshire, England. Turing could not turn to the project of building a stored-program electronic computing machine until the cessation of hostilities in Europe in 1945. Nevertheless, during the war he gave considerable thought to the issue of machine intelligence. One of Turing’s colleagues at Bletchley Park, Donald Michie (who later founded the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception at the University of Edinburgh), later recalled that Turing often discussed how computers could learn from experience as well as solve new problems through the use of guiding principles—a process now known as  heuristic problem solving. Turing gave quite possibly the earliest public lecture (London, 1947) to mention computer intelligence, saying, “What we want is a machine that can learn from experience,” and that the “possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this.” In 1948 he introduced many of the central   of AI in a report entitled “Intelligent Machinery.” However, Turing did not publish this paper, and many of his ideas were later reinvented by others. For instance, one of Turing’s original ideas was to train a network of artificial   to perform specific tasks, an approach described in the section  . At Bletchley Park, Turing illustrated his ideas on machine intelligence by reference to  —a useful source of challenging and clearly defined problems against which proposed methods for   could be tested. In principle, a chess-playing computer could play by searching exhaustively through all the available moves, but in practice this is impossible because it would involve examining an astronomically large number of moves.   are necessary to guide a narrower, more discriminative search. Although Turing experimented with designing chess programs, he had to content himself with theory in the absence of a computer to run his chess program. The first true AI programs had to await the arrival of  . In 1945 Turing predicted that computers would one day play very good chess, and just over 50 years later, in 1997,  , a   built by   (International Business Machines Corporation), beat the reigning world champion,  , in a six-game match. While Turing’s prediction came true, his expectation that chess   would contribute to the understanding of how human beings think did not. The huge improvement in computer chess since Turing’s day is attributable to advances in computer   rather than advances in AI: Deep Blue’s 256 parallel processors enabled it to examine 200 million possible moves per second and to look ahead as many as 14 turns of play. Many agree with  , a linguist at the  , who opined that a computer beating a grandmaster at chess is about as interesting as a bulldozer winning an     competition.

					 ,  the ability of a digital   or computer-controlled   to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the   processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the   in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing  —with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as   as medical  , computer  , voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots. All but the simplest   is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated   behaviour is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger  ,  . When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the  , checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s   is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of  —must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.  generally characterize   not by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning,  ,  , and using language. There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple   program for solving mate-in-one   problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to   on a computer. More challenging is the problem of   what is called  . Generalization involves applying past experience to   new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as   unless it previously had been presented with  , whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add  ” rule and so form the past tense of   based on experience with similar verbs.

					 AI research follows two distinct, and to some extent competing, methods, the symbolic (or “top-down”) approach, and the connectionist (or “bottom-up”) approach. The   seeks to replicate intelligence by analyzing   independent of the biological structure of the  , in terms of the processing of symbols—whence the   label. The  , on the other hand, involves creating artificial   in imitation of the brain’s structure—whence the   label. To illustrate the difference between these approaches, consider the task of building a system, equipped with an  , that recognizes the letters of the alphabet. A bottom-up approach typically involves training an artificial neural network by presenting letters to it one by one, gradually improving performance by “tuning” the network. (Tuning adjusts the responsiveness of different neural pathways to different stimuli.) In contrast, a top-down approach typically involves writing a   that compares each letter with geometric descriptions. Simply put, neural activities are the basis of the bottom-up approach, while symbolic descriptions are the basis of the top-down approach. In   (1932),  , a psychologist at  ,  , first suggested that human   consists of some unknown property of connections between   in the brain. In   (1949),  Donald Hebb, a psychologist at  , Montreal, Canada, suggested that learning specifically involves strengthening certain patterns of neural activity by increasing the probability (weight) of induced   firing between the associated connections. The notion of weighted connections is described in a later section,  . In 1957 two vigorous advocates of symbolic AI—Allen Newell, a researcher at the  ,  , California, and  , a   and   at  , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—summed up the top-down approach in what they called the  physical symbol system hypothesis. This   states that processing structures of symbols is sufficient, in principle, to produce artificial intelligence in a   and that, moreover,   is the result of the same type of symbolic manipulations. During the 1950s and ’60s the top-down and bottom-up approaches were pursued simultaneously, and both achieved noteworthy, if limited, results. During the 1970s, however, bottom-up AI was neglected, and it was not until the 1980s that this approach again became prominent. Nowadays both approaches are followed, and both are acknowledged as facing difficulties. Symbolic techniques work in simplified realms but typically break down when confronted with the real world; meanwhile, bottom-up researchers have been unable to replicate the nervous systems of even the simplest living things.  , a much-studied worm, has approximately 300 neurons whose pattern of interconnections is perfectly known. Yet connectionist models have failed to mimic even this worm. Evidently, the neurons of connectionist theory are gross oversimplifications of the real thing. Employing the methods outlined above, AI research attempts to reach one of three goals: artificial general intelligence (AGI), applied AI, or   simulation. AGI (also called  ) aims to build machines that think. The ultimate ambition of AGI is to produce a   whose overall   ability is indistinguishable from that of a  . As is described in the section  , this goal generated great interest in the 1950s and ’60s, but such optimism has given way to an appreciation of the extreme difficulties involved. To date, progress has been meagre. Some critics doubt whether research will produce even a system with the overall intellectual ability of an   in the foreseeable future. Indeed, some researchers working in AI’s other two branches view AGI as not worth pursuing. Applied AI, also known as advanced  , aims to produce commercially viable “smart” systems—for example, “expert” medical   systems and stock-trading systems. Applied AI has enjoyed considerable success, as described in the section  . In cognitive simulation, computers are used to test theories about how the human   works—for example, theories about how people recognize faces or recall memories. Cognitive simulation is already a powerful   in both neuroscience and  .

					 To reason is to draw   appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either   or  . An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in the café; therefore he is in the museum,” and of the latter, “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure; therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure.” The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case the truth of the   guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of the   lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute  . Inductive reasoning is common in  , where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in   and  , where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules. There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences: it involves drawing inferences   to the solution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI. Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution. Problem-solving methods divide into special purpose and general purpose. A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded. In contrast, a general-purpose method is applicable to a wide variety of problems. One general-purpose technique used in AI is means-end analysis—a step-by-step, or  , reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal. The program selects actions from a list of means—in the case of a simple   this might consist of PICKUP, PUTDOWN, MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and MOVERIGHT—until the goal is reached. Many   problems have been solved by artificial intelligence programs. Some examples are finding the winning move (or sequence of moves) in a board game, devising mathematical proofs, and manipulating “virtual objects” in a computer-generated world. In   the   is scanned by means of various sensory organs, real or artificial, and the scene is decomposed into separate objects in various spatial relationships. Analysis is complicated by the fact that an object may appear different depending on the angle from which it is viewed, the direction and intensity of illumination in the scene, and how much the object contrasts with the surrounding field. One of the earliest systems to   perception and action was  FREDDY, a stationary robot with a moving television eye and a pincer hand, constructed at the  , Scotland, during the period 1966–73 under the direction of Donald Michie. FREDDY was able to recognize a variety of objects and could be instructed to assemble simple  , such as a toy car, from a random heap of components. At present, artificial perception is sufficiently advanced to enable optical sensors to identify individuals and   vehicles to drive at moderate speeds on the open road. A   is a system of signs having meaning by convention. In this sense, language need not be confined to the spoken word. Traffic signs, for example, form a mini-language, it being a matter of convention that ⚠ means “hazard ahead” in some countries. It is distinctive of languages that linguistic units possess meaning by convention, and linguistic meaning is very different from what is called  natural meaning, exemplified in statements such as “Those clouds mean rain” and “The fall in pressure means the valve is malfunctioning.” An important   of full-fledged human languages—in contrast to birdcalls and traffic signs—is their productivity. A productive language can formulate an unlimited variety of sentences. Large language models like   can respond fluently in a human language to questions and statements. Although such models do not actually understand language as humans do but merely select words that are more probable than others, they have reached the point where their command of a language is indistinguishable from that of a normal human. What, then, is involved in genuine understanding, if even a computer that uses language like a native human speaker is not acknowledged to understand? There is no universally agreed upon answer to this difficult question.

					 The earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the British logician and computer pioneer  . In 1935 Turing described an abstract computing   consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the  , symbol by symbol, reading what it finds and writing further symbols. The actions of the scanner are dictated by a program of instructions that also is stored in the memory in the form of symbols. This is Turing’s   concept, and   in it is the possibility of the machine operating on, and so modifying or improving, its own program. Turing’s   is now known simply as the universal  . All modern computers are in essence universal Turing machines. During  , Turing was a leading cryptanalyst at the Government Code and Cypher School in  , Buckinghamshire, England. Turing could not turn to the project of building a stored-program electronic computing machine until the cessation of hostilities in Europe in 1945. Nevertheless, during the war he gave considerable thought to the issue of machine intelligence. One of Turing’s colleagues at Bletchley Park, Donald Michie (who later founded the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception at the University of Edinburgh), later recalled that Turing often discussed how computers could learn from experience as well as solve new problems through the use of guiding principles—a process now known as  heuristic problem solving. Turing gave quite possibly the earliest public lecture (London, 1947) to mention computer intelligence, saying, “What we want is a machine that can learn from experience,” and that the “possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this.” In 1948 he introduced many of the central   of AI in a report entitled “Intelligent Machinery.” However, Turing did not publish this paper, and many of his ideas were later reinvented by others. For instance, one of Turing’s original ideas was to train a network of artificial   to perform specific tasks, an approach described in the section  . At Bletchley Park, Turing illustrated his ideas on machine intelligence by reference to  —a useful source of challenging and clearly defined problems against which proposed methods for   could be tested. In principle, a chess-playing computer could play by searching exhaustively through all the available moves, but in practice this is impossible because it would involve examining an astronomically large number of moves.   are necessary to guide a narrower, more discriminative search. Although Turing experimented with designing chess programs, he had to content himself with theory in the absence of a computer to run his chess program. The first true AI programs had to await the arrival of  . In 1945 Turing predicted that computers would one day play very good chess, and just over 50 years later, in 1997,  , a   built by   (International Business Machines Corporation), beat the reigning world champion,  , in a six-game match. While Turing’s prediction came true, his expectation that chess   would contribute to the understanding of how human beings think did not. The huge improvement in computer chess since Turing’s day is attributable to advances in computer   rather than advances in AI: Deep Blue’s 256 parallel processors enabled it to examine 200 million possible moves per second and to look ahead as many as 14 turns of play. Many agree with  , a linguist at the  , who opined that a computer beating a grandmaster at chess is about as interesting as a bulldozer winning an     competition.

Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technological standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals.  If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services. If we discover that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 16 without the proper consents required by law, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible. Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Britannica has any information from or about anyone under 16, please email us at  . In general, if you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant. As you use our Institutional Services, you may enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we: However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of student data required for the setup of the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution, and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization that acknowledges we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. This aggregated, non-personal information data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties or subcontractors to deliver the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services to our subscribers and only share your student data with our authorized, third-party vendors. Britannica is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure. Any personal information collected through the Services is stored on limited-access servers. We maintain a comprehensive information security program and seek to use commercially reasonable organizational, physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect these servers and the information they store from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss or modification. Our security measures include (among others): encryption of data; security controls that protect the entirety of Britannica’s IT infrastructure from external attack and unauthorized access; and internal policies setting out our data security approach and training for employees, including a Data Breach Notification Policy. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We strive to restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we strive to ensure that all our employees are aware of the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. If there is an unauthorized disclosure of personal information in Britannica’s possession or control, we will take steps in accordance with our written Incident Response Policy to investigate and mitigate the impact of the breach and notify affected customers in the manner required by applicable laws.

These countries may be outside your country of residence, including the United States, and may have different data protection laws than your country. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), Britannica collects and transfers personal information out of the EEA only: with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Britannica in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.

Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by emailing  . Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clearing cookies from your browser or emailing  .  You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.

Although there are as yet no AIs that match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge, some AIs perform specific tasks as well as humans.

					 ,  the ability of a digital   or computer-controlled   to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the   processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the   in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing  —with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as   as medical  , computer  , voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots. All but the simplest   is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated   behaviour is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger  ,  . When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the  , checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s   is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of  —must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.  generally characterize   not by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning,  ,  , and using language. There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple   program for solving mate-in-one   problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to   on a computer. More challenging is the problem of   what is called  . Generalization involves applying past experience to   new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as   unless it previously had been presented with  , whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add  ” rule and so form the past tense of   based on experience with similar verbs.

We may add this information to the information to the information we have already collect through our Services.   Our free (non-subscription) Services and Games are supported by advertising and, as more fully described  ,  Britannica works with third-party service providers to display advertising, including interest-based or behavioral advertising, on the Services. In addition, some of the pages on the Services may be affiliated with Raptive for the purposes of placing advertising on the Service, and Raptive will collect and use certain data for advertising purposes. Raptive’s is LiveRamp with the CMP identification number 3. To learn more about Raptive’s data usage and your related rights, click here:   . We also may work with DigiTrust to set a cookie in your browser to enable us and   to collect web viewing data that includes visits to a Britannica Service and other non-affiliated websites over time. This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other Users and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences. You can exercise choice about the collection of data in this way for interest-based, behavioral advertising by visiting the   and opting out from DigiTrust or use one of the links provided  . Opting out from DigiTrust will stop DigiTrust Partners from using the DigiTrust identifier. Through the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners. Our ad-supported Services and Games may also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this:  ) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers – doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.  Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc. and its group companies (‘LiveRamp’). IX and LiveRamp may use our first party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases in order to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising. These third parties may in turn link further demographic or interest-based information to your browser. You have the choice to opt-out of the use of your data by third-party service providers for this purpose at any time.  Please find more information about opting out  . Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way. Also, please know, if you opt-out of interest-based advertising  . Also, if you opt-out of Britannica’s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies.  If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again.   Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site’s visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.   When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads. Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. As described above, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services and Games, we work with third-party service providers, advertisers and advertising networks that use cookies and other similar technologies to target ads served to our free, ad-supported Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data that you provide directly to advertisers or third-party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser’s or third party partner’s privacy policy. What does it mean to “serve ads”? When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a “request” to the computer that hosts the website (the “host server”) requesting that server to send you (or “serve”) the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and advertising networks to whom we have sold the ad spaces. These advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (“targeting”). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the advertising network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as “behavioral advertising.” Britannica does not provide any personal information to advertisers or advertising networks about visitors to the Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you by third parties on other websites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit  . Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at  . Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive a “opt-out” cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future.  . If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again. We participate in the IAB Transparency & Consent Framework and comply with its  .  Our Consent Management Platform (CMP) is OneTrust LLC with the CMP identification number 28.   Our   more fully describes the cookies, beacons and other similar technology used on the our Services and provides information on when and how users can accept or reject them.  You can opt-out of being behaviorally targeted by Britannica (and other companies employing online advertising) via the following options:   You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Services. For more information about cookies, please visit  .

When you visit a website in any browser, you automatically share information with that website, such as your IP address, and other standard PC information. If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider.  This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technological standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals.  If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services. If we discover that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 16 without the proper consents required by law, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible. Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Britannica has any information from or about anyone under 16, please email us at  . In general, if you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant. As you use our Institutional Services, you may enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we: However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of student data required for the setup of the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution, and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization that acknowledges we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. This aggregated, non-personal information data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties or subcontractors to deliver the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services to our subscribers and only share your student data with our authorized, third-party vendors. Britannica is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure. Any personal information collected through the Services is stored on limited-access servers. We maintain a comprehensive information security program and seek to use commercially reasonable organizational, physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect these servers and the information they store from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss or modification. Our security measures include (among others): encryption of data; security controls that protect the entirety of Britannica’s IT infrastructure from external attack and unauthorized access; and internal policies setting out our data security approach and training for employees, including a Data Breach Notification Policy. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We strive to restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we strive to ensure that all our employees are aware of the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. If there is an unauthorized disclosure of personal information in Britannica’s possession or control, we will take steps in accordance with our written Incident Response Policy to investigate and mitigate the impact of the breach and notify affected customers in the manner required by applicable laws. Your personal information is stored by us using Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage solutions in the AWS Cloud – U.S. East (N. Virginia) Region, with backups in the AWS Cloud – Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region and Brazil (Sao Paulo) Region. We retain your information for the duration of your business relationship with us and as long as necessary to permit us to use it for the legitimate business purposes that we have communicated to you and comply with applicable law or regulations. For more information on where and how long your personal information is stored, and for more information on your rights of erasure and portability, please contact the Britannica’s data protection officer at  .

Information we collect from you will be processed in the United States and may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.  These countries may be outside your country of residence, including the United States, and may have different data protection laws than your country. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), Britannica collects and transfers personal information out of the EEA only: with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Britannica in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.

Learn about the various philosophers, concepts, systems, political agitators, and statesmen that influenced the formation of the U.S. government. The executive branch is headed by the president, whose constitutional responsibilities include serving as commander in chief of the armed forces. Reconstruction was the period after the American Civil War, from roughly 1865 to 1877, during which attempts were made to implement full freedom and constitutional rights for African Americans following emancipation. The longest and most severe economic downturn ever experienced by the industrialized Western world, the Great Depression began in 1929 and lasted until about 1939.  The American Revolution (1775–83) won political independence for 13 of Britain’s North American colonies, which subsequently formed the United States of America. The American Civil War consisted of hundreds of engagements on land and sea. These are among the most important battles On occasion actions by both sides of the Cold War divide resulted in confrontations that brought the ideological adversaries to the brink of war. North Vietnam fought a guerrilla war against U.S.-supported South Vietnamese forces during this war. Learn about the major events and battles of World War II.

					 The earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the British logician and computer pioneer  . In 1935 Turing described an abstract computing   consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the  , symbol by symbol, reading what it finds and writing further symbols. The actions of the scanner are dictated by a program of instructions that also is stored in the memory in the form of symbols. This is Turing’s   concept, and   in it is the possibility of the machine operating on, and so modifying or improving, its own program. Turing’s   is now known simply as the universal  . All modern computers are in essence universal Turing machines. During  , Turing was a leading cryptanalyst at the Government Code and Cypher School in  , Buckinghamshire, England. Turing could not turn to the project of building a stored-program electronic computing machine until the cessation of hostilities in Europe in 1945. Nevertheless, during the war he gave considerable thought to the issue of machine intelligence. One of Turing’s colleagues at Bletchley Park, Donald Michie (who later founded the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception at the University of Edinburgh), later recalled that Turing often discussed how computers could learn from experience as well as solve new problems through the use of guiding principles—a process now known as  heuristic problem solving. Turing gave quite possibly the earliest public lecture (London, 1947) to mention computer intelligence, saying, “What we want is a machine that can learn from experience,” and that the “possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this.” In 1948 he introduced many of the central   of AI in a report entitled “Intelligent Machinery.” However, Turing did not publish this paper, and many of his ideas were later reinvented by others. For instance, one of Turing’s original ideas was to train a network of artificial   to perform specific tasks, an approach described in the section  . At Bletchley Park, Turing illustrated his ideas on machine intelligence by reference to  —a useful source of challenging and clearly defined problems against which proposed methods for   could be tested. In principle, a chess-playing computer could play by searching exhaustively through all the available moves, but in practice this is impossible because it would involve examining an astronomically large number of moves.   are necessary to guide a narrower, more discriminative search. Although Turing experimented with designing chess programs, he had to content himself with theory in the absence of a computer to run his chess program. The first true AI programs had to await the arrival of  . In 1945 Turing predicted that computers would one day play very good chess, and just over 50 years later, in 1997,  , a   built by   (International Business Machines Corporation), beat the reigning world champion,  , in a six-game match. While Turing’s prediction came true, his expectation that chess   would contribute to the understanding of how human beings think did not. The huge improvement in computer chess since Turing’s day is attributable to advances in computer   rather than advances in AI: Deep Blue’s 256 parallel processors enabled it to examine 200 million possible moves per second and to look ahead as many as 14 turns of play. Many agree with  , a linguist at the  , who opined that a computer beating a grandmaster at chess is about as interesting as a bulldozer winning an     competition.

					 AI research follows two distinct, and to some extent competing, methods, the symbolic (or “top-down”) approach, and the connectionist (or “bottom-up”) approach. The   seeks to replicate intelligence by analyzing   independent of the biological structure of the  , in terms of the processing of symbols—whence the   label. The  , on the other hand, involves creating artificial   in imitation of the brain’s structure—whence the   label. To illustrate the difference between these approaches, consider the task of building a system, equipped with an  , that recognizes the letters of the alphabet. A bottom-up approach typically involves training an artificial neural network by presenting letters to it one by one, gradually improving performance by “tuning” the network. (Tuning adjusts the responsiveness of different neural pathways to different stimuli.) In contrast, a top-down approach typically involves writing a   that compares each letter with geometric descriptions. Simply put, neural activities are the basis of the bottom-up approach, while symbolic descriptions are the basis of the top-down approach. In   (1932),  , a psychologist at  ,  , first suggested that human   consists of some unknown property of connections between   in the brain. In   (1949),  Donald Hebb, a psychologist at  , Montreal, Canada, suggested that learning specifically involves strengthening certain patterns of neural activity by increasing the probability (weight) of induced   firing between the associated connections. The notion of weighted connections is described in a later section,  . In 1957 two vigorous advocates of symbolic AI—Allen Newell, a researcher at the  ,  , California, and  , a   and   at  , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—summed up the top-down approach in what they called the  physical symbol system hypothesis. This   states that processing structures of symbols is sufficient, in principle, to produce artificial intelligence in a   and that, moreover,   is the result of the same type of symbolic manipulations. During the 1950s and ’60s the top-down and bottom-up approaches were pursued simultaneously, and both achieved noteworthy, if limited, results. During the 1970s, however, bottom-up AI was neglected, and it was not until the 1980s that this approach again became prominent. Nowadays both approaches are followed, and both are acknowledged as facing difficulties. Symbolic techniques work in simplified realms but typically break down when confronted with the real world; meanwhile, bottom-up researchers have been unable to replicate the nervous systems of even the simplest living things.  , a much-studied worm, has approximately 300 neurons whose pattern of interconnections is perfectly known. Yet connectionist models have failed to mimic even this worm. Evidently, the neurons of connectionist theory are gross oversimplifications of the real thing. Employing the methods outlined above, AI research attempts to reach one of three goals: artificial general intelligence (AGI), applied AI, or   simulation. AGI (also called  ) aims to build machines that think. The ultimate ambition of AGI is to produce a   whose overall   ability is indistinguishable from that of a  . As is described in the section  , this goal generated great interest in the 1950s and ’60s, but such optimism has given way to an appreciation of the extreme difficulties involved. To date, progress has been meagre. Some critics doubt whether research will produce even a system with the overall intellectual ability of an   in the foreseeable future. Indeed, some researchers working in AI’s other two branches view AGI as not worth pursuing. Applied AI, also known as advanced  , aims to produce commercially viable “smart” systems—for example, “expert” medical   systems and stock-trading systems. Applied AI has enjoyed considerable success, as described in the section  . In cognitive simulation, computers are used to test theories about how the human   works—for example, theories about how people recognize faces or recall memories. Cognitive simulation is already a powerful   in both neuroscience and  .

The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of student data required for the setup of the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution, and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization that acknowledges we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. This aggregated, non-personal information data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties or subcontractors to deliver the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services to our subscribers and only share your student data with our authorized, third-party vendors.

					 AI research follows two distinct, and to some extent competing, methods, the symbolic (or “top-down”) approach, and the connectionist (or “bottom-up”) approach. The   seeks to replicate intelligence by analyzing   independent of the biological structure of the  , in terms of the processing of symbols—whence the   label. The  , on the other hand, involves creating artificial   in imitation of the brain’s structure—whence the   label. To illustrate the difference between these approaches, consider the task of building a system, equipped with an  , that recognizes the letters of the alphabet. A bottom-up approach typically involves training an artificial neural network by presenting letters to it one by one, gradually improving performance by “tuning” the network. (Tuning adjusts the responsiveness of different neural pathways to different stimuli.) In contrast, a top-down approach typically involves writing a   that compares each letter with geometric descriptions. Simply put, neural activities are the basis of the bottom-up approach, while symbolic descriptions are the basis of the top-down approach. In   (1932),  , a psychologist at  ,  , first suggested that human   consists of some unknown property of connections between   in the brain. In   (1949),  Donald Hebb, a psychologist at  , Montreal, Canada, suggested that learning specifically involves strengthening certain patterns of neural activity by increasing the probability (weight) of induced   firing between the associated connections. The notion of weighted connections is described in a later section,  . In 1957 two vigorous advocates of symbolic AI—Allen Newell, a researcher at the  ,  , California, and  , a   and   at  , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—summed up the top-down approach in what they called the  physical symbol system hypothesis. This   states that processing structures of symbols is sufficient, in principle, to produce artificial intelligence in a   and that, moreover,   is the result of the same type of symbolic manipulations. During the 1950s and ’60s the top-down and bottom-up approaches were pursued simultaneously, and both achieved noteworthy, if limited, results. During the 1970s, however, bottom-up AI was neglected, and it was not until the 1980s that this approach again became prominent. Nowadays both approaches are followed, and both are acknowledged as facing difficulties. Symbolic techniques work in simplified realms but typically break down when confronted with the real world; meanwhile, bottom-up researchers have been unable to replicate the nervous systems of even the simplest living things.  , a much-studied worm, has approximately 300 neurons whose pattern of interconnections is perfectly known. Yet connectionist models have failed to mimic even this worm. Evidently, the neurons of connectionist theory are gross oversimplifications of the real thing. Employing the methods outlined above, AI research attempts to reach one of three goals: artificial general intelligence (AGI), applied AI, or   simulation. AGI (also called  ) aims to build machines that think. The ultimate ambition of AGI is to produce a   whose overall   ability is indistinguishable from that of a  . As is described in the section  , this goal generated great interest in the 1950s and ’60s, but such optimism has given way to an appreciation of the extreme difficulties involved. To date, progress has been meagre. Some critics doubt whether research will produce even a system with the overall intellectual ability of an   in the foreseeable future. Indeed, some researchers working in AI’s other two branches view AGI as not worth pursuing. Applied AI, also known as advanced  , aims to produce commercially viable “smart” systems—for example, “expert” medical   systems and stock-trading systems. Applied AI has enjoyed considerable success, as described in the section  . In cognitive simulation, computers are used to test theories about how the human   works—for example, theories about how people recognize faces or recall memories. Cognitive simulation is already a powerful   in both neuroscience and  .

					 To reason is to draw   appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either   or  . An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in the café; therefore he is in the museum,” and of the latter, “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure; therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure.” The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case the truth of the   guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of the   lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute  . Inductive reasoning is common in  , where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in   and  , where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules. There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences: it involves drawing inferences   to the solution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI. Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution. Problem-solving methods divide into special purpose and general purpose. A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded. In contrast, a general-purpose method is applicable to a wide variety of problems. One general-purpose technique used in AI is means-end analysis—a step-by-step, or  , reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal. The program selects actions from a list of means—in the case of a simple   this might consist of PICKUP, PUTDOWN, MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and MOVERIGHT—until the goal is reached.

					 To reason is to draw   appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either   or  . An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in the café; therefore he is in the museum,” and of the latter, “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure; therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure.” The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case the truth of the   guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of the   lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute  . Inductive reasoning is common in  , where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in   and  , where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules. There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences: it involves drawing inferences   to the solution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI. Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution. Problem-solving methods divide into special purpose and general purpose. A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded. In contrast, a general-purpose method is applicable to a wide variety of problems. One general-purpose technique used in AI is means-end analysis—a step-by-step, or  , reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal. The program selects actions from a list of means—in the case of a simple   this might consist of PICKUP, PUTDOWN, MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and MOVERIGHT—until the goal is reached.

The start of the   is generally taken as 1209, when scholars from Oxford migrated to Cambridge to escape Oxford’s riots of “town and gown” (townspeople versus scholars). To avert possible troubles, the authorities in Cambridge allowed only scholars under the supervision of a master to remain in the town. It was partly to provide an orderly place of residence that (in emulation of Oxford) the first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugo de Balsham, bishop of  . Over the next three centuries another 15 colleges were founded, and in 1318 Cambridge received formal recognition as a   from  . Cambridge remained fairly insignificant until about 1502, when a professorship of divinity was founded—the oldest in the university. In 1511   went to Cambridge and did much to inculcate the new learning of the Renaissance there. In 1546   founded   (which was and still remains the largest of the Cambridge colleges). In 1570   gave the university a revised body of statutes, and in 1571 the university was formally incorporated by act of Parliament. The new statutes, which remained in force for nearly three centuries, vested the effective government of the university in the heads of colleges. Membership of the university was no longer   without membership of a college. In 1663 the Lucasian professorship of mathematics was founded under the will of a former member of the university, and six years later the first holder resigned in favour of  , then a young fellow of Trinity. Newton held the chair for over 30 years and gave the study of mathematics a unique position in the university. When the honours examination came into being in the 18th century, it was primarily mathematical. (It was called the tripos, after the three-legged stool used formerly at disputations; and candidates placed in the first class were known as wranglers from the style of argument at a disputation.) A classical tripos was instituted in 1824, and tripos in natural sciences and   sciences were added in 1851. In 1871 the university established the Cavendish professorship of experimental physics and began the building of the Cavendish Laboratory.   (second wrangler in 1854) was the first professor, beginning a leadership in physics at the university that would be continued by   and  . Here, too, the team of   and   and the team of   and   elucidated the structures of proteins and of the double-helix  , to found the modern science of  . Earlier came the work of  , who, more than perhaps any other man, can be hailed as the founder of biochemistry. Noted Cambridge scholars in other fields have been the naturalist  , the economist  , and the historian  . The colleges and   institutions of the university are: Christ’s (1505), Churchill (1960), Clare (1326), Clare Hall (1966), Corpus Christi (1352), Darwin (1964), Downing (1800), Emmanuel (1584), Fitzwilliam (1869), Girton (1869), Gonville and Caius (1348), Homerton (1977), Hughes Hall (1885), Jesus (1496), King’s (1441), Lucy Cavendish (1965), Magdalene (1542), New Hall (1954), Newnham (1871), Pembroke (1347), Peterhouse (1284), Queens’ (1448), Robinson (1977), St. Catharine’s (1473), St. Edmund’s House (1896),   (1511), Selwyn (1882), Sidney Sussex (1596), Trinity (1546), Trinity Hall (1350), and Wolfson (1965). Many of the college buildings are rich in history and tradition. King’s College Chapel, begun in 1446, is one of   most magnificent buildings. The mulberry tree under which the poet   is reputed to have written   is on the grounds of Christ’s College.   library, housed in the original cases, is at Magdalene College. Two of the colleges contain chapels designed by Christopher Wren—Pembroke and Emmanuel. The gardens and grounds of the colleges along the River Cam are known as the “Backs,” and together they form a unique combination of large-scale architecture, natural and formal gardens, and river scenery with student boaters. The university library with well over 3,000,000 volumes is one of a handful in the country that is entitled to a copy of every book published in Great Britain.

For other activities using weights but distinct from weightlifting,    ,  , and  . Weightlifting has a lengthy history. For many prehistoric tribes, the traditional test of manhood was the lifting of a special rock. Such manhood stones, some with the name of the first lifter incised, exist in Greece and in Scottish castles. The competitive lifting of stones still   locally in Germany, Switzerland, the highlands of Montenegro, and the Basque region of Spain. In many such events the consecutive number of lifts within a given time period is used to declare a winner. The origins of modern weightlifting competition are to be found in the 18th- and 19th-century strong men, such as   and  Arthur Saxon of Germany,   of Russia, and  Louis Apollon of France, who performed in circuses and theatres. By 1891 there was international competition in London. The revived   of 1896 included weightlifting events, as did the Games of 1900 and 1904, but thereafter these events were suspended until 1920. In that year, at the suggestion of the  , the  International Weightlifting Federation (Fédération Haltérophile Internationale; FHI) was formed to regularize events and supervise international competition. By 1928 the one- and two-hand lifts of earlier Games had given way to only two-hand lifts: the  , the clean and jerk, and the clean and press (described below). The press was abandoned in 1972. In the Games before  , the leading weightlifters were French, German, and Egyptian. After the war American weightlifters were dominant until 1953. Thereafter Soviet and Bulgarian weightlifters held a virtual monopoly on world records and championships. By the late 1990s the leading countries competing in weightlifting were Turkey, Greece, and China. World championships were held in 1922–23 and from 1937, except during the war years, and European championships were held from 1924 through 1936. A weightlifting competition for women was added to the Olympic Games in 2000. The weight used in modern competitive lifting is the  barbell, a steel bar or rod to which cast-iron or steel disk weights are attached at each end on a revolving sleeve. The range of weights added is 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 2.5, and 1.25 kg (55, 44, 33, 22, 11, 5.5, and 2.75 pounds). From 1928 to 1968 the three international lifts were the  , the clean and jerk, and the press (or clean and press). In all lifts the barbell rests on the floor initially. Lifts are performed on a wooden platform 4 metres (13.1 feet) square. If a lifter steps off the platform during a lift, the lift is not allowed. In the snatch the barbell is lifted from the floor to arm’s length overhead in a single,  , explosive movement, with the lifter being permitted to move his feet or to squat under the barbell as he lifts it before recovering to an erect position. The   is a two-part lift. After lifting the barbell to the shoulders, the lifter jerks it overhead to arm’s length, with no restrictions on the time necessary to complete the lift or on leg movements. In both lifts, the lifter must complete the lift with feet in line, body erect, arms and legs extended, and the barbell in control overhead. The lifter must either hold the weight overhead for two seconds or wait for the referee’s signal before lowering the barbell back to the floor. The  press was also a two-part lift. As in the clean and jerk, the barbell was brought to the lifter’s shoulders, the same foot motion being allowed. Then the lifter had to stand erect until the referee signaled for the completion of the lift, which was achieved by pressing the barbell upward in a steady continuous movement to arm’s length overhead but without any assistance by moving the legs. Men’s competitions are divided into eight body-weight categories (upper limits given): 56 kg (123 pounds), 62 kg (137 pounds), 69 kg (152 pounds), 77 kg (170 pounds), 85 kg (187 pounds), 94 kg (207 pounds), 105 kg (231 pounds), and more than 105 kg. For women there are seven weight divisions: 48 kg (106 pounds), 53 kg (117 pounds), 58 kg (128 pounds), 63 kg (139 pounds), 69 kg (152 pounds), 75 kg (165 pounds), and more than 75 kg.

The start of the   is generally taken as 1209, when scholars from Oxford migrated to Cambridge to escape Oxford’s riots of “town and gown” (townspeople versus scholars). To avert possible troubles, the authorities in Cambridge allowed only scholars under the supervision of a master to remain in the town. It was partly to provide an orderly place of residence that (in emulation of Oxford) the first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugo de Balsham, bishop of  . Over the next three centuries another 15 colleges were founded, and in 1318 Cambridge received formal recognition as a   from  . Cambridge remained fairly insignificant until about 1502, when a professorship of divinity was founded—the oldest in the university. In 1511   went to Cambridge and did much to inculcate the new learning of the Renaissance there. In 1546   founded   (which was and still remains the largest of the Cambridge colleges). In 1570   gave the university a revised body of statutes, and in 1571 the university was formally incorporated by act of Parliament. The new statutes, which remained in force for nearly three centuries, vested the effective government of the university in the heads of colleges. Membership of the university was no longer   without membership of a college. In 1663 the Lucasian professorship of mathematics was founded under the will of a former member of the university, and six years later the first holder resigned in favour of  , then a young fellow of Trinity. Newton held the chair for over 30 years and gave the study of mathematics a unique position in the university. When the honours examination came into being in the 18th century, it was primarily mathematical. (It was called the tripos, after the three-legged stool used formerly at disputations; and candidates placed in the first class were known as wranglers from the style of argument at a disputation.) A classical tripos was instituted in 1824, and tripos in natural sciences and   sciences were added in 1851. In 1871 the university established the Cavendish professorship of experimental physics and began the building of the Cavendish Laboratory.   (second wrangler in 1854) was the first professor, beginning a leadership in physics at the university that would be continued by   and  . Here, too, the team of   and   and the team of   and   elucidated the structures of proteins and of the double-helix  , to found the modern science of  . Earlier came the work of  , who, more than perhaps any other man, can be hailed as the founder of biochemistry. Noted Cambridge scholars in other fields have been the naturalist  , the economist  , and the historian  . The colleges and   institutions of the university are: Christ’s (1505), Churchill (1960), Clare (1326), Clare Hall (1966), Corpus Christi (1352), Darwin (1964), Downing (1800), Emmanuel (1584), Fitzwilliam (1869), Girton (1869), Gonville and Caius (1348), Homerton (1977), Hughes Hall (1885), Jesus (1496), King’s (1441), Lucy Cavendish (1965), Magdalene (1542), New Hall (1954), Newnham (1871), Pembroke (1347), Peterhouse (1284), Queens’ (1448), Robinson (1977), St. Catharine’s (1473), St. Edmund’s House (1896),   (1511), Selwyn (1882), Sidney Sussex (1596), Trinity (1546), Trinity Hall (1350), and Wolfson (1965). Many of the college buildings are rich in history and tradition. King’s College Chapel, begun in 1446, is one of   most magnificent buildings. The mulberry tree under which the poet   is reputed to have written   is on the grounds of Christ’s College.   library, housed in the original cases, is at Magdalene College. Two of the colleges contain chapels designed by Christopher Wren—Pembroke and Emmanuel. The gardens and grounds of the colleges along the River Cam are known as the “Backs,” and together they form a unique combination of large-scale architecture, natural and formal gardens, and river scenery with student boaters. The university library with well over 3,000,000 volumes is one of a handful in the country that is entitled to a copy of every book published in Great Britain. Noteworthy collections include the Acton Library of  ,  , and modern history, the W.G. Aston Japanese library, the papers of Charles Darwin, and the Wade Chinese collection. The   contains, among other things, important collections of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman antiquities; medieval and modern manuscripts; and paintings of European masters.

Appropriately, in 1896 the first modern marathon winner was a Greek,  . In 1924 the Olympic marathon distance was standardized at 42,195 metres (26 miles 385 yards). This was based on a decision of the British Olympic Committee to start the 1908 Olympic race from   and finish it in front of the royal box in the stadium at London. The marathon was added to the women’s Olympic program in 1984. After the Olympic Games championship, one of the most   honours in marathon   is victory in the  , held annually since 1897. It draws athletes from all parts of the world and in 1972 became the first major marathon to officially allow women to compete. Other premiere marathons are held in London,  , Berlin,  , Tokyo, and Amsterdam. Marathons are not held on the track but on roads, and, despite the fact that courses are not of equal difficulty, the   (IAAF) does list world records for the marathon and also for the half-marathon. World-record times in the marathon steadily declined over the course of the 20th century from slightly under three hours to slightly more than two hours. It was long considered necessary for a runner to prepare for a marathon by training over that distance. At the 1952 Olympic Games, however, Czech   set an Olympic record of 2 hours 23 minutes 3.2 seconds, even though he had never run the distance before. In the decades following, other first-time marathoners also won premiere events and set records at the distance. By the late 20th century, road racing, and marathon running in particular, had grown to become a recreational activity with broad appeal.  Ultramarathons, which are neither Olympic nor IAAF events, are longer races based on a specific distance or an   time period for competition, such as a 12-hour race.

Through the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners. Our ad-supported Services and Games may also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this:  ) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers – doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.  Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc. and its group companies (‘LiveRamp’). IX and LiveRamp may use our first party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases in order to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising.

When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads. Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. As described above, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services and Games, we work with third-party service providers, advertisers and advertising networks that use cookies and other similar technologies to target ads served to our free, ad-supported Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data that you provide directly to advertisers or third-party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser’s or third party partner’s privacy policy. What does it mean to “serve ads”? When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a “request” to the computer that hosts the website (the “host server”) requesting that server to send you (or “serve”) the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and advertising networks to whom we have sold the ad spaces. These advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (“targeting”). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the advertising network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as “behavioral advertising.” Britannica does not provide any personal information to advertisers or advertising networks about visitors to the Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you by third parties on other websites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit  . Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at  . Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive a “opt-out” cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future.  .

This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technological standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals.

In general, if you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant. As you use our Institutional Services, you may enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we: However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of student data required for the setup of the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution, and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization that acknowledges we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. This aggregated, non-personal information data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties or subcontractors to deliver the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services to our subscribers and only share your student data with our authorized, third-party vendors.

It was released on November 30, 2022, by the American company   and almost immediately disturbed academics, journalists, and others because of concern that it was impossible to distinguish human- from ChatGPT-generated writing. Language models produce text based on the   for a word to occur based on previous words in the sequence. By being trained on about 45 terabytes of text from the  , the GPT-3 language model used by ChatGPT calculates that some sequences of words are more likely to occur than others. For example, “the cat sat on the mat” is more likely to occur in   than “sat the the mat cat on” and thus would be more likely to appear in a ChatGPT response. ChatGPT refers to itself as “a language model developed by OpenAI, a leading   research lab.” The model is based on the “GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer)  , which is a type of   designed for natural language  processing tasks.”  ChatGPT says its primary purpose “is to generate human-like text, which can be used for a variety of applications, such as  , automated content creation, and language translation.” It continues by saying “The model can understand and respond to user input in a way that mimics human conversation, allowing for more natural and engaging interactions. Additionally, ChatGPT can generate text in a variety of styles and formats, such as news articles, emails, and  , making it versatile and useful for a wide range of applications.” For example, when asked to produce a   about  , ChatGPT generated: (However, this haiku has seven   instead of five on the first line.) ChatGPT impressed many with its command of written English and as a demonstration of how far artificial intelligence (AI) had advanced. Within five days of its introduction, more than one million users had signed up for a free account to interact with ChatGPT. The software showed that it could pass exams in advanced courses. For example, Wharton Business School professor Christian Terwiesch found that ChatGPT passed the final exam in his course in operations management; however, on some questions it made “surprising mistakes in relatively simple calculations at the level of 6th grade math.” Educators became concerned that students would cheat by having ChatGPT write their essays, with some even proposing that essays should no longer be   as homework assignments. The American media company   announced that it would use OpenAI tools, such as ChatGPT, to produce content, such as quizzes, that would be personalized for readers. In 1950 British mathematician   proposed a test for assessing whether a computer can be described as thinking. A human questioner interrogates both a human subject and a  . By means of a series of such tests, a computer’s success at “thinking” can be measured by its probability of being misidentified as the human subject. Buzzfeed data scientist Max Woolf said that ChatGPT had passed the   in December 2022, but some experts claim that ChatGPT did not pass a true Turing test because in ordinary usage ChatGPT often states that it is a language model. Although ChatGPT had many strong traits, it also had some surprising weaknesses. The model can add two-digit numbers (e.g., 23 + 56) with complete accuracy, but for multiplying two-digit numbers (e.g., 23 × 56), it produces the right answer only about 30 percent of the time. Like other large language models, ChatGPT can sometimes “hallucinate,” a term used to describe the tendency for such models to respond with inaccurate or misleading information. For example, ChatGPT was asked to tell the   of Hercules and the  . There is no such Greek  ; nevertheless, ChatGPT told a story of Hercules learning to share his resources with a colony of talking ants when marooned on a desert island. When asked if there really was such a Greek myth, ChatGPT apologized and replied that there was no such myth but that it had created a fable based on its understanding of Greek mythology. When further asked why it made up such a myth instead of simply saying that there was no such myth, it apologized again and said that “as a language model, my main function is to respond to prompts by generating text based on patterns and associations in the   I’ve been trained on.” ChatGPT tends not to say that it does not know an answer to a question but instead produces probable text based on the prompts given to it. ChatGPT is, at least, forthright about its limitations. When asked if it is a reliable source of information, it replies that “it is not recommended to rely on ChatGPT as a sole source of factual information. Instead, it should be used as a tool to generate text or complete language-based tasks, and any information provided by the model should be verified with credible sources.” Even answers to questions about  , an unlikely source of hallucinations, have proved inaccurate so often that the popular programming question-and-answer site Stack Overflow temporarily banned answers from ChatGPT.

For other activities using weights but distinct from weightlifting,    ,  , and  . Weightlifting has a lengthy history. For many prehistoric tribes, the traditional test of manhood was the lifting of a special rock. Such manhood stones, some with the name of the first lifter incised, exist in Greece and in Scottish castles. The competitive lifting of stones still   locally in Germany, Switzerland, the highlands of Montenegro, and the Basque region of Spain. In many such events the consecutive number of lifts within a given time period is used to declare a winner. The origins of modern weightlifting competition are to be found in the 18th- and 19th-century strong men, such as   and  Arthur Saxon of Germany,   of Russia, and  Louis Apollon of France, who performed in circuses and theatres. By 1891 there was international competition in London. The revived   of 1896 included weightlifting events, as did the Games of 1900 and 1904, but thereafter these events were suspended until 1920. In that year, at the suggestion of the  , the  International Weightlifting Federation (Fédération Haltérophile Internationale; FHI) was formed to regularize events and supervise international competition. By 1928 the one- and two-hand lifts of earlier Games had given way to only two-hand lifts: the  , the clean and jerk, and the clean and press (described below). The press was abandoned in 1972. In the Games before  , the leading weightlifters were French, German, and Egyptian. After the war American weightlifters were dominant until 1953. Thereafter Soviet and Bulgarian weightlifters held a virtual monopoly on world records and championships. By the late 1990s the leading countries competing in weightlifting were Turkey, Greece, and China. World championships were held in 1922–23 and from 1937, except during the war years, and European championships were held from 1924 through 1936. A weightlifting competition for women was added to the Olympic Games in 2000. The weight used in modern competitive lifting is the  barbell, a steel bar or rod to which cast-iron or steel disk weights are attached at each end on a revolving sleeve. The range of weights added is 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 2.5, and 1.25 kg (55, 44, 33, 22, 11, 5.5, and 2.75 pounds). From 1928 to 1968 the three international lifts were the  , the clean and jerk, and the press (or clean and press). In all lifts the barbell rests on the floor initially. Lifts are performed on a wooden platform 4 metres (13.1 feet) square. If a lifter steps off the platform during a lift, the lift is not allowed. In the snatch the barbell is lifted from the floor to arm’s length overhead in a single,  , explosive movement, with the lifter being permitted to move his feet or to squat under the barbell as he lifts it before recovering to an erect position. The   is a two-part lift. After lifting the barbell to the shoulders, the lifter jerks it overhead to arm’s length, with no restrictions on the time necessary to complete the lift or on leg movements. In both lifts, the lifter must complete the lift with feet in line, body erect, arms and legs extended, and the barbell in control overhead. The lifter must either hold the weight overhead for two seconds or wait for the referee’s signal before lowering the barbell back to the floor. The  press was also a two-part lift. As in the clean and jerk, the barbell was brought to the lifter’s shoulders, the same foot motion being allowed. Then the lifter had to stand erect until the referee signaled for the completion of the lift, which was achieved by pressing the barbell upward in a steady continuous movement to arm’s length overhead but without any assistance by moving the legs. Men’s competitions are divided into eight body-weight categories (upper limits given): 56 kg (123 pounds), 62 kg (137 pounds), 69 kg (152 pounds), 77 kg (170 pounds), 85 kg (187 pounds), 94 kg (207 pounds), 105 kg (231 pounds), and more than 105 kg. For women there are seven weight divisions: 48 kg (106 pounds), 53 kg (117 pounds), 58 kg (128 pounds), 63 kg (139 pounds), 69 kg (152 pounds), 75 kg (165 pounds), and more than 75 kg.

The start of the   is generally taken as 1209, when scholars from Oxford migrated to Cambridge to escape Oxford’s riots of “town and gown” (townspeople versus scholars). To avert possible troubles, the authorities in Cambridge allowed only scholars under the supervision of a master to remain in the town. It was partly to provide an orderly place of residence that (in emulation of Oxford) the first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugo de Balsham, bishop of  . Over the next three centuries another 15 colleges were founded, and in 1318 Cambridge received formal recognition as a   from  .

In 1570   gave the university a revised body of statutes, and in 1571 the university was formally incorporated by act of Parliament. The new statutes, which remained in force for nearly three centuries, vested the effective government of the university in the heads of colleges. Membership of the university was no longer   without membership of a college. In 1663 the Lucasian professorship of mathematics was founded under the will of a former member of the university, and six years later the first holder resigned in favour of  , then a young fellow of Trinity. Newton held the chair for over 30 years and gave the study of mathematics a unique position in the university. When the honours examination came into being in the 18th century, it was primarily mathematical. (It was called the tripos, after the three-legged stool used formerly at disputations; and candidates placed in the first class were known as wranglers from the style of argument at a disputation.) A classical tripos was instituted in 1824, and tripos in natural sciences and   sciences were added in 1851. In 1871 the university established the Cavendish professorship of experimental physics and began the building of the Cavendish Laboratory.

The Olympic Games are an athletic festival that originated in   and were revived in the late 19th century. They are the world’s foremost sports competition and include athletes from all over the world. The first Olympic Games had achieved major importance in Greece by the end of the 6th century BCE. They began to lose popularity when Greece was conquered by Rome in the 2nd century BCE, and the Games were officially abolished about 400 CE because of their pagan associations. The Olympics were revived in the late 19th century, with the first modern Games being held in Greece is 1896. The Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games are each held every four years. After 1992, when both a Summer and Winter Games were held, they have been held on a staggered two-year schedule so that the Olympic Games occur every two years in either summer or winter.  The   chooses the location of each Olympic Games. The choice is based on applications made by the chief authority of a city, with support of the national government. In individual Olympic events the award for first place is a gold medal, for second place a silver medal, and for third place a bronze medal. Diplomas are awarded for fourth through eighth places, and all competitors and officials receive a commemorative medal. Winning a bid to host the Olympic Games has been considered a major boon for any city, but not all agree. Proponents believe that   can increase valuable tourism, boost local economies, and grow a host country's global trade and stature. Others maintain, however, that the Olympics are a financial drain on host cities and force them to create expensive infrastructure and buildings that fall into disuse.  ,  athletic festival that originated in   and was   in the late 19th century. Before the 1970s the Games were officially limited to competitors with amateur status, but in the 1980s many events were opened to professional athletes. Currently, the Games are open to all, even the top professional athletes in   and  . The   included several of the sports that are now part of the   program, which at times has included events in as many as 32 different  . In 1924 the Winter Games were sanctioned for winter sports. The Olympic Games have come to be regarded as the world’s foremost sports  . Just how far back in history organized athletic contests were held remains a matter of debate, but it is reasonably certain that they occurred in   almost 3,000 years ago. However ancient in origin, by the end of the 6th century   at least four Greek sporting festivals, sometimes called “classical games,” had achieved major importance: the Olympic Games, held at  ; the   at  ; the   at Nemea; and the  , held near  . Later, similar festivals were held in nearly 150 cities as far afield as  ,  , Odessus,  , and  . Of all the games held throughout Greece, the Olympic Games were the most famous. Held every four years between August 6 and September 19, they occupied such an important place in Greek history that in late antiquity historians measured time by the interval between them—an Olympiad. The Olympic Games, like almost all Greek games, were an   part of a religious festival. They were held in honour of   at Olympia by the   of   in the northwestern  . The first Olympic   listed in the records was Coroebus of Elis, a cook, who won the sprint race in 776  . Notions that the Olympics began much earlier than 776   are founded on  , not historical evidence. According to one  , for example, the Games were founded by  , son of Zeus and  . At the meeting in 776   there was apparently only one event, a   that covered one length of the track at Olympia, but other events were added over the ensuing decades. The race, known as the  , was about 192 meters (210 yards) long. The word   also came to refer to the track on which the race was held and is the origin of the modern English word  . In 724   a two-length race, the  , roughly similar to the 400-meter race, was included, and four years later the  , a long-distance race possibly   to the modern 1,500- or 5,000-meter events, was added.   and the   were introduced in 708  . The latter was an all-around competition consisting of five events—the  , the  , the  , a footrace, and wrestling.  was introduced in 688   and   eight years later. In 648   the   (from Greek  ), a kind of no-holds-barred combat, was included. This brutal contest combined wrestling, boxing, and street fighting. Kicking and hitting a downed opponent were allowed; only biting and gouging (thrusting a finger or thumb into an opponent’s eye) were forbidden. Between 632 and 616   events for boys were introduced. And from time to time further events were added, including a footrace in which athletes ran in partial armour and contests for   and for trumpeters. The program, however, was not nearly so varied as that of the modern Olympics. There were neither team games nor ball games, and the   (track and field) events were limited to the four running events and the pentathlon mentioned above. Chariot races and  , which became part of the ancient Games, were held in the   south of the stadium. In the early centuries of Olympic competition, all the contests took place on one day; later the Games were spread over four days, with a fifth devoted to the closing-ceremony presentation of prizes and a banquet for the champions. In most events the athletes participated in the nude. Through the centuries scholars have sought to explain this practice. Theories have ranged from the   (to be nude in public without an   demonstrated self-control) to the usual anthropological, religious, and social explanations, including the following: (1) nudity bespeaks a  , (2) nudity was a holdover from the days of   and  , (3) nudity had, for the Greeks, a magical power to ward off harm, and (4) public nudity was a kind of costume of the upper class. Historians grasp at dubious theories because, in Judeo-Christian society, to compete nude in public seems odd, if not scandalous. Yet ancient Greeks found nothing shameful about nudity, especially male nudity. Therefore, the many modern explanations of Greek athletic nudity are in the main unnecessary. The Olympic Games were technically restricted to freeborn Greeks. Many Greek competitors came from the Greek colonies on the   and in   and  . Most of the participants were professionals who trained full-time for the events. These athletes earned substantial prizes for winning at many other preliminary festivals, and, although the only prize at Olympia was a wreath or garland, an Olympic champion also received widespread   and often lavish benefits from his home city.

The functions of language include  , the expression of  ,  , imaginative expression, and   release. Many definitions of language have been proposed.  Henry Sweet, an English phonetician and language scholar, stated: “Language is the expression of ideas by means of speech-sounds combined into words. Words are combined into sentences, this combination answering to that of ideas into thoughts.” The American linguists  Bernard Bloch and George L. Trager formulated the following definition: “A language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a social group cooperates.” Any     of language makes a number of presuppositions and begs a number of questions. The first, for example, puts excessive weight on “thought,” and the second uses “arbitrary” in a specialized, though  , way. A number of considerations (marked in italics below) enter into a proper understanding of language as a subject:  In  , this     consists of noises resulting from movements of certain organs within the throat and mouth. In  , these symbols may be hand or body movements, gestures, or facial expressions. By means of these symbols, people are able to impart information, to express feelings and emotions, to influence the activities of others, and to comport themselves with varying degrees of friendliness or hostility toward persons who make use of substantially the same set of symbols.  No two people speak exactly alike; hence, one is able to recognize the voices of friends over the telephone and to keep distinct a number of unseen speakers in a radio broadcast.  , clearly, no one would say that they speak different languages. Generally, systems of communication are recognized as different languages if they cannot be understood without specific learning by both parties, though the precise limits of mutual intelligibility are hard to draw and belong on a scale rather than on either side of a definite dividing line. Substantially different systems of communication that may impede but do not prevent mutual comprehension are called   of a language. In order to describe in detail the actual different language patterns of individuals, the term  ,   the habits of expression of a single person, has been coined.  Subsequent “second” languages are learned to different degrees of competence under various conditions. Complete mastery of two languages is designated as  ; in many cases—such as upbringing by parents using different languages at home or being raised within a multilingual community—children grow up as bilinguals. In traditionally monolingual  , the learning, to any extent, of a second or other language is an activity superimposed on the prior mastery of one’s first language and is a different process intellectually.  Other members of the animal kingdom have the ability to communicate, through vocal noises or by other means, but the most important single feature characterizing human language (that is, every individual language), against every known mode of animal communication, is its   productivity and  . Human beings are unrestricted in what they can communicate; no area of experience is accepted as necessarily incommunicable, though it may be necessary to adapt one’s language in order to cope with new discoveries or new modes of  .   systems are by contrast very tightly circumscribed in what may be communicated. Indeed, displaced reference, the ability to communicate about things outside immediate temporal and spatial contiguity, which is fundamental to speech, is found elsewhere only in the so-called language of  . Bees are able, by carrying out various conventionalized movements (referred to as   dances) in or near the hive, to indicate to others the locations and strengths of food sources. But food sources are the only known theme of this communication system. Surprisingly, however, this system, nearest to human language in function, belongs to a species remote from humanity in the animal kingdom. On the other hand, the animal performance superficially most like human speech, the mimicry of parrots and of some other birds that have been kept in the company of humans, is wholly   and serves no independent communicative function. Humankind’s nearest relatives among the primates, though possessing a vocal physiology similar to that of humans, have not developed anything like a spoken language. Attempts to teach   to chimpanzees and other apes through imitation have achieved limited success, though the interpretation of the significance of ape signing ability remains controversial.  However,   and   studies have drawn attention to a range of other functions for language. Among these is the use of language to express a national or local identity (a common source of conflict in situations of multiethnicity around the world, such as in Belgium,  , and Quebec). Also important are the “ludic” (playful) function of language—encountered in such phenomena as  ,  , and  —and the range of functions seen in imaginative or symbolic  , such as  ,  , and religious expression. Language interacts with every aspect of human life in society, and it can be understood only if it is considered in relation to society. This article attempts to survey language in this light and to consider its various functions and the purposes it can and has been made to serve. Because each language is both a working system of communication in the period and in the   wherein it is used and also the product of its history and the source of its future development, any account of language must consider it from both these points of view. The   of language is known as  . It includes what are generally distinguished as descriptive linguistics and  . Linguistics is now a highly technical subject; it embraces, both descriptively and historically, such major divisions as  ,   (including   and  ),  , and  , dealing in detail with these various aspects of language.

The lifter must either hold the weight overhead for two seconds or wait for the referee’s signal before lowering the barbell back to the floor. The  press was also a two-part lift. As in the clean and jerk, the barbell was brought to the lifter’s shoulders, the same foot motion being allowed. Then the lifter had to stand erect until the referee signaled for the completion of the lift, which was achieved by pressing the barbell upward in a steady continuous movement to arm’s length overhead but without any assistance by moving the legs. Men’s competitions are divided into eight body-weight categories (upper limits given): 56 kg (123 pounds), 62 kg (137 pounds), 69 kg (152 pounds), 77 kg (170 pounds), 85 kg (187 pounds), 94 kg (207 pounds), 105 kg (231 pounds), and more than 105 kg. For women there are seven weight divisions: 48 kg (106 pounds), 53 kg (117 pounds), 58 kg (128 pounds), 63 kg (139 pounds), 69 kg (152 pounds), 75 kg (165 pounds), and more than 75 kg.

Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law, contract or otherwise provided herein. If we discover we have received any personal information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Britannica has any personal information from or about anyone under 16, please contact us at  .  If you are a student with access to our Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your academic institution and us, your student service data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant.  As you use the Services, you will enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with academic institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we:

 However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data processed by Britannica in connection with subscribed-to Services. You control what student data is entered on this site and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of personally identifiable student data required for the setup of the subscribed-to Service’s system is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, may also be required to complete the subscribed-to Service’s system setup, including the teacher’s first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Services to your academic institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including personally identifiable student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your academic institution may from time-to-time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization, which acknowledges that we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and that once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. That aggregated, non-personally identifiable data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personal information or student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. Britannica uses third-party vendors to help us provide the Services. For example, Amazon Web Services provides our cloud hosting facilities. These vendors can only use your personal information or student data to provide the contracted services, not for their own commercial purposes, and are subject to written security, confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations. If you are a Britannica institutional customer or user and would like more information on the vendors used to help provide the Services to you, please send an email to   requesting more information. We do not subcontract the provision of the Services to, or share your personal information or student data with, any other third parties. Britannica is committed to keeping your personal information and student data safe and secure. Any personal information collected through the Services is stored on limited-access servers. We maintain a comprehensive information security program and seek to use commercially reasonable organizational, physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect these servers and the information they store from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss or modification. Our security measures include (among others): encryption of data; security controls that protect the entirety of Britannica’s IT infrastructure from external attack and unauthorized access; and internal policies setting out our data security approach and training for employees, including a Data Breach Notification Policy. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We strive to restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we strive to ensure that all our employees are aware of the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. If there is an unauthorized disclosure of personal information or student data in Britannica’s possession or control, we will take steps in accordance with our written Incident Response Policy to investigate and mitigate the impact of the breach and notify affected institutional customers in the manner required by applicable laws or our contracts with the affected institutional customers. In addition, we will cooperate with our institutional customers in notifying affected students or their parents/legal guardians and in taking any other legally required actions. Your personal information and student data is stored by us using Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage solutions in the AWS Cloud – U.S. East (N. Virginia) Region, with backups in the AWS Cloud - Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region and Brazil (Sao Paulo) Region. We retain your information for the duration of your business relationship with us and as long as necessary to permit us to use it for the legitimate business purposes that we have communicated to you and comply with applicable law or regulations.

These tools use cookies to collect and store standard Internet log and visitor information on our behalf, including information about what pages you visit, how long you are on our sites, how you got here, and what you click on during your visit.

We may add this information to the information to the information we have already collect through our Services.   Our free (non-subscription) Services and Games are supported by advertising and, as more fully described  ,  Britannica works with third-party service providers to display advertising, including interest-based or behavioral advertising, on the Services. In addition, some of the pages on the Services may be affiliated with Raptive for the purposes of placing advertising on the Service, and Raptive will collect and use certain data for advertising purposes. Raptive’s is LiveRamp with the CMP identification number 3. To learn more about Raptive’s data usage and your related rights, click here:   . We also may work with DigiTrust to set a cookie in your browser to enable us and   to collect web viewing data that includes visits to a Britannica Service and other non-affiliated websites over time. This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other Users and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences. You can exercise choice about the collection of data in this way for interest-based, behavioral advertising by visiting the   and opting out from DigiTrust or use one of the links provided  . Opting out from DigiTrust will stop DigiTrust Partners from using the DigiTrust identifier. Through the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners. Our ad-supported Services and Games may also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this:  ) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers – doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.  Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc. and its group companies (‘LiveRamp’). IX and LiveRamp may use our first party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases in order to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising. These third parties may in turn link further demographic or interest-based information to your browser. You have the choice to opt-out of the use of your data by third-party service providers for this purpose at any time.  Please find more information about opting out  . Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way. Also, please know, if you opt-out of interest-based advertising  . Also, if you opt-out of Britannica’s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies.  If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again.   Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site’s visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.   When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads. Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. As described above, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services and Games, we work with third-party service providers, advertisers and advertising networks that use cookies and other similar technologies to target ads served to our free, ad-supported Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data that you provide directly to advertisers or third-party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser’s or third party partner’s privacy policy. What does it mean to “serve ads”? When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a “request” to the computer that hosts the website (the “host server”) requesting that server to send you (or “serve”) the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and advertising networks to whom we have sold the ad spaces. These advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (“targeting”). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the advertising network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as “behavioral advertising.” Britannica does not provide any personal information to advertisers or advertising networks about visitors to the Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you by third parties on other websites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit  . Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at  . Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive a “opt-out” cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future.  . If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again. We participate in the IAB Transparency & Consent Framework and comply with its  .  Our Consent Management Platform (CMP) is OneTrust LLC with the CMP identification number 28.   Our   more fully describes the cookies, beacons and other similar technology used on the our Services and provides information on when and how users can accept or reject them.  You can opt-out of being behaviorally targeted by Britannica (and other companies employing online advertising) via the following options:   You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Services. For more information about cookies, please visit  . Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way.   You can control the use of your personal information by Google Analytics by visiting the ‘Your privacy controls’ section of the Google Privacy Policy located at  . You also can use the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to disable tracking by Google Analytics.  To delete these cookies, please see your browser’s privacy settings or follow the above instructions.

IX may continue to add opt-out options.  To opt out of LiveRamp’s use of your personal information, please head here:  . When you visit a website in any browser, you automatically share information with that website, such as your IP address, and other standard PC information. If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider.  This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technological standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals.  If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services. If we discover that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 16 without the proper consents required by law, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible. Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Britannica has any information from or about anyone under 16, please email us at  . In general, if you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant. As you use our Institutional Services, you may enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we: However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of student data required for the setup of the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution, and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization that acknowledges we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. This aggregated, non-personal information data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties or subcontractors to deliver the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services to our subscribers and only share your student data with our authorized, third-party vendors. Britannica is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure. Any personal information collected through the Services is stored on limited-access servers. We maintain a comprehensive information security program and seek to use commercially reasonable organizational, physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect these servers and the information they store from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss or modification. Our security measures include (among others): encryption of data; security controls that protect the entirety of Britannica’s IT infrastructure from external attack and unauthorized access; and internal policies setting out our data security approach and training for employees, including a Data Breach Notification Policy. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We strive to restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we strive to ensure that all our employees are aware of the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. If there is an unauthorized disclosure of personal information in Britannica’s possession or control, we will take steps in accordance with our written Incident Response Policy to investigate and mitigate the impact of the breach and notify affected customers in the manner required by applicable laws. Your personal information is stored by us using Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage solutions in the AWS Cloud – U.S. East (N. Virginia) Region, with backups in the AWS Cloud – Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region and Brazil (Sao Paulo) Region. We retain your information for the duration of your business relationship with us and as long as necessary to permit us to use it for the legitimate business purposes that we have communicated to you and comply with applicable law or regulations. For more information on where and how long your personal information is stored, and for more information on your rights of erasure and portability, please contact the Britannica’s data protection officer at  . Britannica’s headquarters are in the United States. Information we collect from you will be processed in the United States and may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.  These countries may be outside your country of residence, including the United States, and may have different data protection laws than your country. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), Britannica collects and transfers personal information out of the EEA only: with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Britannica in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. Britannica endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal information and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. You have the right to request that the Company disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you: You have the right to request that the Company delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either: Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must: We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing in accordance with CCPA requirements. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.  We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by emailing  . Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clearing cookies from your browser or emailing  .  You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not: However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.  Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

Relations found between various types of stimulation (e.g., light waves and sound waves) and their associated percepts suggest inferences that can be made about the properties of the perceptual process; theories of perceiving then can be developed on the basis of these inferences. Because the perceptual process is not itself public or directly observable (except to the perceiver himself, whose percepts are given directly in experience), the validity of perceptual theories  ...(100 of 9427 words)

Opting out from DigiTrust will stop DigiTrust Partners from using the DigiTrust identifier. Through the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners. Our ad-supported Services and Games may also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this:  ) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers – doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.  Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc. and its group companies (‘LiveRamp’). IX and LiveRamp may use our first party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases in order to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising. These third parties may in turn link further demographic or interest-based information to your browser. You have the choice to opt-out of the use of your data by third-party service providers for this purpose at any time.  Please find more information about opting out  .

For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site’s visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.   When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads. Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. As described above, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services and Games, we work with third-party service providers, advertisers and advertising networks that use cookies and other similar technologies to target ads served to our free, ad-supported Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data that you provide directly to advertisers or third-party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser’s or third party partner’s privacy policy. What does it mean to “serve ads”? When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a “request” to the computer that hosts the website (the “host server”) requesting that server to send you (or “serve”) the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and advertising networks to whom we have sold the ad spaces. These advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (“targeting”). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the advertising network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as “behavioral advertising.” Britannica does not provide any personal information to advertisers or advertising networks about visitors to the Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you by third parties on other websites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit  . Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at  . Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive a “opt-out” cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future.  . If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again. We participate in the IAB Transparency & Consent Framework and comply with its  .

In general, if you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant. As you use our Institutional Services, you may enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we: However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of student data required for the setup of the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution, and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization that acknowledges we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. This aggregated, non-personal information data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties or subcontractors to deliver the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services to our subscribers and only share your student data with our authorized, third-party vendors.

For example, a   conditioned to salivate to a tone of a particular pitch and loudness will also salivate with considerable regularity in response to tones of higher and lower pitch. The generalized response is predictable and orderly: it will measure less than that elicited by the original tone and will diminish as the new tone departs increasingly from the original. Similar behaviour is observed in humans, as children learning to talk may call anything that can be sat upon “chair” or any man “daddy.” Adults conditioned by mild   to fear a certain word will respond with symptoms of anxiety to any synonym of that word; in this instance, physical similarity, the usual basis of generalization, is less important than prior learning. Responses may also be generalized, allowing an individual to take an   course of action if the usual response is for some reason precluded. Learning may be considered a balance of generalization and   (the ability to respond to differences among stimuli). An imbalance can lead to negative results. For example, a child who is scared by a man with a beard may fail to discriminate between bearded men and generalize that all men with beards are to be feared.

Within the next century or two, we   are likely to upgrade ourselves into gods and change the most basic principles of the evolution of life. Traditional mythologies depicted gods as powerful beings that could design and create life according to their wishes. In the coming two centuries we will probably learn how to engineer and manufacture various life forms according to our wishes. We will use   in order to create new kinds of organic beings; we will use direct brain-computer interfaces in order to create cyborgs (beings that combine organic and inorganic parts); and advances in machine learning and   might even allow us to set in motion the creation of completely inorganic beings. The main products of the future economy will not be food, textiles, and vehicles but rather bodies, brains, and minds. This will be not just the greatest revolution in history but the greatest revolution in biology since the appearance of life on Earth. For four billion years life was governed by the laws of natural selection. During all these eons, whether you were a virus or a dinosaur, you evolved according to the principles of natural selection. In addition, no matter what strange and bizarre shapes life took, it remained confined to the organic realm. Whether a cactus or a whale, you were made of organic compounds and you remained subject to the laws of organic chemistry. In the next two centuries, however, science could be ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds—but   intelligent design and the intelligent design of our cloud computing. In the process,   itself will likely disappear. In 200 years Earth will probably be dominated by entities more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals or chimpanzees. Today we still share with Neanderthals and chimpanzees most of our bodily structures, physical abilities, and mental faculties. Not only are our hands, eyes, and brains distinctly hominid, but so are our lust, our love, our anger, and our social bonds. Within 200 years the combination of   and AI might result in bodily, physical, and mental traits that completely break free of the hominid mold. For example, brain-computer interfaces could result in distributed bodies—beings whose organs are spread widely in space.

In mammals the two go together. Mammals solve problems by feeling things. But computers are very different. So far the amazing development of computer intelligence has not been accompanied by any development of computer consciousness. There might be several alternative ways leading to  superintelligence, only some of which pass through the straits of consciousness. For millions of years mammalian evolution has been slowly sailing along the conscious route. The evolution of inorganic life forms, however, may completely bypass these narrow straits, charting a different and much quicker course to superintelligence. We might end up with a world dominated by superintelligent but completely  nonconscious  entities.  Encyclopædia Britannica Anniversary Edition: 250 Years of Excellence (1768–2018).

					 Both   and   are controlled by hormones. Molting is initiated when sensory   in the body wall detect that the internal soft tissues have filled the old   and trigger production of a hormone from neurosecretory cells in the  . This hormone acts upon the  , an endocrine gland in the prothorax, which in turn secretes the molting hormone, a steroid known as  . Molting hormone then acts on the  , stimulating growth and   formation.   likewise is controlled by a hormone. Throughout the young larval stages a small gland behind the brain, called the  , secretes   (also known as neotenin). As long as this hormone is present in the   the molting epidermal cells lay down a larval cuticle. In the last larval stage, juvenile hormone is no longer produced, and the insect undergoes metamorphosis into an  . Among holometabolous insects the   develops in the presence of a very small amount of juvenile hormone. Although a state of arrested development may occur during any stage,   occurs most commonly in pupae. In   latitudes many insects overwinter in the pupal stage (e.g.,  ). The immediate cause of diapause, failure to secrete the growth and molting hormones, usually is induced by a decrease in daylength as summer wanes. In addition to changes in form during development, many insects exhibit   as  . For example, the worker and reproductive   in ants and bees may be different, termites have a soldier caste as well as reproductives and persistent  , adult aphids (Homoptera) may be winged or wingless, and some butterflies show striking seasonal or  . The general interpretation of all such differences is that, although the   to develop different forms is present in the genes of every member of a given  , particular lines of development are evoked by environmental stimuli. Hormones, including perhaps juvenile hormone, may be agents for the control of such changes. The life of the adult insect is geared primarily to reproduction. Since reproduction is sexual in almost all insects, mating must be followed by impregnation of the female and   of eggs. Usually the male seeks out the female. In butterflies in which vision is important, the colour of the female in flight can attract a male of the same species. In   (Ephemeroptera) and certain   (Diptera), males dance in   to provide a visual attraction for females. In certain beetles (e.g.,   and  ) parts of the   body in the female have become modified to form a luminous organ that attracts the male. Male   and   attract females by their chirping songs, and the male   is lured by the sound emitted by the female in flight. The most important element in mating, however, is  . Most female insects secrete odorous substances called   that serve as specific attractants and excitants for males. The male likewise may produce scents that excite the female. Certain scales ( ) on the wings of many male butterflies function in this way. Assembling scents, active in small quantities, are well known in female   and   as male attractants. The queen substance in the honeybee serves the same purpose. Mating and   production require   temperatures and adequate  . The need for   is particularly important, and in insects such as   (butterflies and moths), which take only sugar and water in the adult stage, necessary protein is derived from larval reserves. Temperature and nutrition often influence hormone secretion. Juvenile hormone or hormones from the neurosecretory cells commonly are needed for egg production. In the absence of these hormones reproduction is arrested, and the insect enters a reproductive diapause. This phenomenon occurs in   of genus   during the winter. A few insects (e.g., the    ) rarely produce males, and the eggs develop without fertilization in a process known as  . During summer months in temperate latitudes, aphids occur only as parthenogenetic females in which embryos develop within the mother ( ). In certain   (Diptera) oocytes start developing parthenogenetically in the ovaries of the larvae, and the young larvae escape by destroying the body of their mother in a process called  . Insects have an elaborate system of sense organs.    , concentrated on the antennae, palps, legs, and tarsi, cover the entire body surface. The hairs serve to inform the insect about its surroundings and its body position (a phenomenon known as  ). For example, contact between the hairs on the feet and the ground   movement and may lead to a state of rest in some insects. Modified mechanical sense organs in the cuticle called  campaniform organs detect bending strains in the integument. Such organs exist in the wings and enable the insect to control flight movements. Campaniform organs, well developed in small clublike   (the modified hind wings of dipterans), serve as strain gauges and enable the   to control its   in flight. Exceedingly sensitive organs called   are concentrated in organs of hearing. These can be found on the bushy antennae of the male mosquito or tympanal organs in the front legs of crickets or in abdominal pits of grasshoppers and many moths. In moths these sensitive organs can perceive the high-pitched sounds emitted by   as they hunt by  . Insects complement organs of   with sound-producing organs, which usually are (as in crickets) wing membranes that vibrate in response to movement of a stiff rod across a row of   teeth. Sometimes (as in  ) a timbal (membrane) in the wall of the   is set in   by a rapidly contracting muscle attached to it. Chemical perceptions by the thin-walled sensilla may be comparable to the   sense of   or  . Many insect   are specialized according to specific behaviour patterns. For example, although approximately equivalent to humans in the perception of flower odours and sugar sweetness, honeybees are exceedingly sensitive to the queen substance, which is scentless to humans. And male silkworm moths are excited by infinitesimal traces of the female sex  , even in the presence of odours that are intensely strong to humans. Although the insect eye provides less clarity than the  , insects can form adequate visual impressions of their surroundings. Insects have good  , with colour perception extending (as in ants and bees) into the ultraviolet, although it often fails to extend into the deep red. Many flowers have patterns of ultraviolet reflection invisible to the human eye but visible to the insect eye. The insect orients itself by responding to the   it receives. Formerly, insect behaviour was described as a series of movements in response to stimuli. That   has been supplanted by one that holds that the insect has a   with built-in patterns of behaviour or   that can be triggered by environmental stimuli. These responses are modified by the insect’s internal state, which has been affected by preceding stimuli. Patterns of behaviour range from comparatively simple   responses (e.g., the avoidance of adverse stimuli, the grasping of a rough surface on contact with the claws) to elaborate behavioral sequences (e.g., searching for mates, courtship, mating, and locating egg laying sites; hunting, capturing, and eating prey). The highest developments of behaviour, found in   such as the ants, bees, and termites, are based on the   principle. An interesting example of a behavioral pattern is that found in the    . The female   first locates a site for her nest in rotten wood and shapes the nest into a long tunnel. She then seeks out a preferred shrub from which pieces of leaves are gathered to build a cell. She first cuts a disc for a cell cap and then a series of oval pieces for the walls. After preparing the nest, she provisions it with a mixture of   and  , lays an egg, and then closes the cell with more cut leaves. The leaf-cutter bee repeats this sequence until the nest is filled. Each act can be performed only in this set sequence. The insect does not stop to repair any damage to the nest but proceeds undeterred to the next step in her behavioral pattern.  behaviours are more flexible than those of the leaf-cutter bee. Behavioral sequences of individuals are predictable, but the choice of acts or duties within the hive can be influenced by the needs of the colony. Honeybees exhibit capacity for   (e.g., interpreting the waggle dance, learning flower colours), which is important in any insect that has to find its nest. Although these behaviours are necessary for both colony and food source location, learning capacity plays a relatively small part in the overall pattern of honeybee behaviour. Experimental studies of details of behaviour have provided significant information about the properties of the sense organs. These studies also have provided information on the ability of insects to learn from their experience in the  .

For example, a   conditioned to salivate to a tone of a particular pitch and loudness will also salivate with considerable regularity in response to tones of higher and lower pitch. The generalized response is predictable and orderly: it will measure less than that elicited by the original tone and will diminish as the new tone departs increasingly from the original. Similar behaviour is observed in humans, as children learning to talk may call anything that can be sat upon “chair” or any man “daddy.” Adults conditioned by mild   to fear a certain word will respond with symptoms of anxiety to any synonym of that word; in this instance, physical similarity, the usual basis of generalization, is less important than prior learning. Responses may also be generalized, allowing an individual to take an   course of action if the usual response is for some reason precluded. Learning may be considered a balance of generalization and   (the ability to respond to differences among stimuli). An imbalance can lead to negative results. For example, a child who is scared by a man with a beard may fail to discriminate between bearded men and generalize that all men with beards are to be feared.

Wasps are distinguished from the ants and bees of Apocrita by various behavioral and physical characteristics, particularly their possession of a slender, smooth body and legs with relatively few hairs. Wasps also generally are predatory or parasitic and have stingers with few barbs that can be removed easily from their victims. Similar to other members of Apocrita, wasps have a narrow petiole, or “waist,” which attaches the abdomen to the thorax.

					 ,  (class Insecta or Hexapoda),  any member of the largest class of the phylum  , which is itself the largest of the   phyla. Insects have   bodies, jointed legs, and external skeletons ( ). Insects are distinguished from other arthropods by their body, which is divided into three major regions: (1) the  , which bears the  , eyes, and a pair of antennae, (2) the three-segmented  , which usually has three pairs of legs (hence “Hexapoda”) in adults and usually one or two pairs of wings, and (3) the many-segmented  , which contains the digestive, excretory, and reproductive organs. In a popular sense, “insect” usually refers to familiar pests or disease carriers, such as  ,  , clothes moths,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and hornets, or to   groups, such as  ,  , and beetles. Many insects, however, are   from a   viewpoint; they pollinate plants, produce useful substances, control   insects, act as scavengers, and serve as food for other animals (   ). Furthermore, insects are valuable objects of study in elucidating many aspects of   and  . Much of the scientific knowledge of   has been gained from   experiments and of population biology from flour beetle studies. Insects are often used in investigations of hormonal action, nerve and sense organ function, and many other physiological processes. Insects are also used as environmental quality indicators to assess water quality and soil contamination and are the basis of many studies of  . In numbers of   and individuals and in adaptability and wide distribution, insects are perhaps the most eminently successful group of all animals. They dominate the present-day land fauna with about 1 million described species. This represents about three-fourths of all described animal species. Entomologists estimate the actual number of living insect species could be as high as 5 million to 10 million. The orders that contain the greatest numbers of species are   ( ),   (butterflies and  ),   ( , bees,  ), and   (true flies). The majority of insects are small, usually less than 6 mm (0.2 inch) long, although the range in size is wide. Some of the   and parasitic wasps are almost microscopic, while some tropical forms such as the hercules beetles, African goliath beetles, certain Australian stick insects, and the wingspan of the hercules   can be as large as 27 cm (10.6 inches). In many species the difference in body structure between the sexes is pronounced, and knowledge of one sex may give few clues to the appearance of the other sex. In some, such as the twisted-wing insects ( ), the female is a mere inactive bag of eggs, and the winged male is one of the most active insects known. Modes of reproduction are quite  , and reproductive capacity is generally high. Some insects, such as the  , feed only in the immature or larval stage and go without food during an extremely short   life. Among social insects, queen termites may live for up to 50 years, whereas some adult mayflies live less than two hours. Some insects advertise their presence to the other sex by flashing lights, and many imitate other insects in colour and form and thus avoid or minimize attack by predators that feed by day and find their   visually, as do birds, lizards, and other insects. Behaviour is diverse, from the almost   parasitic forms, whose   lie in the nutrient bloodstreams of their hosts and feed by absorption, to   that pursue victims in the air,   that outrun prey on land, and predaceous water beetles that outswim prey in water. In some cases the adult insects make elaborate preparations for the young, in others the mother alone defends or feeds her young, and in still others the young are supported by complex insect societies. Some colonies of social insects, such as tropical   and  , may reach populations of millions of inhabitants.

The shock may range from an unpleasant but harmless jolt of static  , received after one has walked over a thick carpet on a dry day, to a lethal   from a power line. The great majority of deaths occur from   at house-current frequencies of 60   (cycles per second) in   and 50 hertz in Europe. Most of the deaths occur from contact with   at less than 500 volts. That is not to say that high voltages are less dangerous, but they are generally present only on apparatus and supply lines operated by utility companies, which attempt to ensure that only trained and authorized persons have access to them. The effects of electric shock on the   depend on the current that flows—the amperage—rather than on the force of the current, or voltage. The   of the human body is variable and may in fact alter considerably during the passage of an electric shock. Therefore, except in broad terms, applied voltage is not a  . This leads to difficulties in the investigation of accidents, for the electrical engineer is often able to state only the voltage applied, but the physician thinks in terms of the current that flowed. Another important consideration is the path that the current takes through the body. Looked at as an electrical conductor, the body behaves as a solution of   in a leathery container. The greatest current density therefore occurs along the axis joining the two points of contact. As the distance perpendicular to the line of current flow increases, the density of current rapidly falls off. Thus, the   most likely to be affected are those that lie close to the direct path of the current. As the great majority of electrical fatalities are due to currents passing between an arm (usually the right) and the legs, the current passes through the chest and affects the organs within it. Except in those extremely unusual accidents in which the head makes one of the points of contact, the   does not lie on or near the pathway of the current. An electric shock may directly cause   in three ways:   of the breathing centre in the brain, paralysis of the  , or   (uncontrolled, extremely rapid twitching of the heart muscle). It is generally believed that ventricular fibrillation is the most common cause of death in electric shock.  (CPR) is the best emergency first-aid   for victims of electrical shock. It is a highly effective technique when applied by a well-trained person and can, in many cases, provide adequate short-term life support until more sophisticated treatment is available. Although the great majority of victims of electric shock, excluding those who have been burned, either die or recover completely, a very small number suffer from aftereffects, which may be temporary but are sometimes permanent. These may include   of the eye, a form of   (attacks of pain beneath the breastbone), or various disorders of the  . A variety of other conditions have been reported, but, in most cases, their exact relationship to the electrical accident is unclear or cannot be clinically  .

To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of student data required for the setup of the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution, and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization that acknowledges we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. This aggregated, non-personal information data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties or subcontractors to deliver the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services to our subscribers and only share your student data with our authorized, third-party vendors.

A dog is a   mammal of the family   and the order Carnivora. Its scientific name is  . Dogs are a subspecies of the gray wolf, and they are also related to foxes and jackals. Dogs are one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world. (  are the other.)  is a way for dogs to communicate with other dogs and with humans. Fierce barking or growling often signals that dogs are being territorial, feel threatened, or simply want to be left alone. However, dogs also bark when they are bored and want attention from other dogs or from humans. A dog may sniff other dogs’ rear ends to gather chemical information that helps the sniffer identify them as individuals.  -lined sacs, housed internally on either side of a dog’s anus, produce a scent that contributes to each dog’s unique odour profile. That profile may also indicate   makeup,   status, diet, and emotional state.  Many people have learned that one human year equals roughly seven dog years. However, this is a huge oversimplification. How a dog ages is based largely on its size and breed. Smaller dogs tend to age “slower” than larger dogs. Also, the aging rate of some breeds, such as  , differs from that of other similarly sized breeds. Beginning when dogs are six weeks old, a series of four doses of combined   against  ,  ,  , and   are given two to four weeks apart. Within one year of that series, they receive a booster, which is readministered every three years. At three months old, dogs can receive a   vaccine, which is readministered every year or every three years. Whether cities should enact breed-specific legislation (BSL, or "pit bill bans") for dogs is widely debated. Some see BSL as a humane way of making communities safer by discouraging dog fighting and the breeding of dangerous dogs. Others argue there is no evidence that BSL makes communities safer and that other legislation would be more effective than expensive and controversial BSL laws. For more on the debate on pit bull bans, visit  . ,  ( ),  domestic   of the family   (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the   ( ) and is related to   and  . The dog is one of the two most   and most popular domestic animals in the world (the   is the other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a   companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend. The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role in creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most   form of  , dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts and created new breeds as need or desire arose. Dogs are regarded differently in different parts of the world. Characteristics of loyalty, friendship, protectiveness, and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the   and Europe the care and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business. Western civilization has given the relationship between human and dog great importance, but, in some of the developing nations and in many areas of Asia, dogs are not held in the same esteem. In some areas of the world, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden or even for food, whereas in the United States and Europe dogs are protected and admired. In   during the days of the pharaohs, dogs were considered to be sacred. Paleontologists and archaeologists have determined that about 60 million years ago a small mammal, rather like a  , lived in the environs of what are now parts of Asia. It is called  , the   that became the ancestor of the animals known today as canids: dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes.   did not leave direct descendants, but doglike canids evolved from it. By about 30 to 40 million years ago   had evolved into the first true dog—namely,  . This was a medium-size  , longer than it was tall, with a long tail and a fairly brushy coat. Over the millennia   gave rise to two branches, one in Africa and the other in  . The Eurasian branch was called   and is the progenitor of wolves, dogs, and foxes. Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended directly from wolves ( ) and that the now-extinct wolf lineages that produced dogs branched off from the line that produced modern living wolves sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago. The timing and location of dog   is a matter of debate. There is strong genetic evidence, however, that the first domestication events occurred somewhere in northern Eurasia between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago. In this region wolves likely   their own domestication by trailing nomadic people in northern Eurasia and consuming the remains of game animals that hunters left behind. Most studies agree that domestication was not a single discrete event. It was a process that unfolded over thousands of years—likely involving dog populations that appeared in different parts of Eurasia at different times, with dogs and wild wolves continuing to interbreed with one another and with early dog populations being replaced by later ones. Some genetic studies have documented evidence of early domestication events in specific regions. One study   that wolves were domesticated 16,300 years ago to serve as livestock in  , whereas another reports that early dogs dating from about 12,000 to 14,000 years ago came from a small strain of   that inhabited  . Genetic evidence also reveals that dogs did not accompany the first humans to the New World more than 15,000 years ago, suggesting instead that dogs came to the Americas only some 10,000 years ago. One study even suggested that some dogs have descended not from the   but rather from the  . These dogs, found in  , might have given rise to some of the present native African breeds. No matter what their origins, all canids have certain common  . They are mammals that   live young. The females have mammary glands, and they suckle their offspring. The early breeds had erect ears and pointed or wedge-shaped muzzles, similar to the northern breeds common today. Most of the carnivores have similar dental structures, which is one way paleontologists have been able to identify them. They develop two sets of teeth, deciduous (“baby”) teeth and permanent teeth. Canids walk on their toes, in contrast to an animal like the bear, which is flat-footed and walks on its heels. Dogs, like most mammals, have body hair and are homeothermic—that is to say, they have an internal thermostat that permits them to maintain their body temperature at a constant level despite the outside temperature. Fossil remains suggest that five distinct types of dogs existed by the beginning of the   (about 4500  ). They were the mastiffs, wolf-type dogs, sight hounds (such as the Saluki or greyhound), pointing dogs, and herding dogs.

This information is used for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns and to provide services requested by our customers. We also have implemented certain   features. These tools use cookies to collect and store standard Internet log and visitor information on our behalf, including information about what pages you visit, how long you are on our sites, how you got here, and what you click on during your visit. This Google Analytics data is not tied to personal information, so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.

We may add this information to the information to the information we have already collect through our Services.   Our free (non-subscription) Services and Games are supported by advertising and, as more fully described  ,  Britannica works with third-party service providers to display advertising, including interest-based or behavioral advertising, on the Services. In addition, some of the pages on the Services may be affiliated with Raptive for the purposes of placing advertising on the Service, and Raptive will collect and use certain data for advertising purposes. Raptive’s is LiveRamp with the CMP identification number 3. To learn more about Raptive’s data usage and your related rights, click here:   . We also may work with DigiTrust to set a cookie in your browser to enable us and   to collect web viewing data that includes visits to a Britannica Service and other non-affiliated websites over time. This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other Users and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences. You can exercise choice about the collection of data in this way for interest-based, behavioral advertising by visiting the   and opting out from DigiTrust or use one of the links provided  . Opting out from DigiTrust will stop DigiTrust Partners from using the DigiTrust identifier. Through the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners. Our ad-supported Services and Games may also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this:  ) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers – doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.  Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc. and its group companies (‘LiveRamp’). IX and LiveRamp may use our first party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases in order to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising. These third parties may in turn link further demographic or interest-based information to your browser. You have the choice to opt-out of the use of your data by third-party service providers for this purpose at any time.  Please find more information about opting out  . Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way. Also, please know, if you opt-out of interest-based advertising  . Also, if you opt-out of Britannica’s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies.  If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again.   Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site’s visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.   When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads. Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. As described above, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services and Games, we work with third-party service providers, advertisers and advertising networks that use cookies and other similar technologies to target ads served to our free, ad-supported Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data that you provide directly to advertisers or third-party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser’s or third party partner’s privacy policy. What does it mean to “serve ads”? When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a “request” to the computer that hosts the website (the “host server”) requesting that server to send you (or “serve”) the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and advertising networks to whom we have sold the ad spaces. These advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (“targeting”). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the advertising network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as “behavioral advertising.” Britannica does not provide any personal information to advertisers or advertising networks about visitors to the Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you by third parties on other websites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit  . Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at  . Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive a “opt-out” cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future.  . If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again. We participate in the IAB Transparency & Consent Framework and comply with its  .  Our Consent Management Platform (CMP) is OneTrust LLC with the CMP identification number 28.   Our   more fully describes the cookies, beacons and other similar technology used on the our Services and provides information on when and how users can accept or reject them.  You can opt-out of being behaviorally targeted by Britannica (and other companies employing online advertising) via the following options:   You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Services. For more information about cookies, please visit  . Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way.   You can control the use of your personal information by Google Analytics by visiting the ‘Your privacy controls’ section of the Google Privacy Policy located at  . You also can use the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to disable tracking by Google Analytics.

When you visit a website in any browser, you automatically share information with that website, such as your IP address, and other standard PC information. If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider.  This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technological standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals.  If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services. If we discover that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 16 without the proper consents required by law, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible. Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Britannica has any information from or about anyone under 16, please email us at  . In general, if you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant. As you use our Institutional Services, you may enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we: However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of student data required for the setup of the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution, and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization that acknowledges we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. This aggregated, non-personal information data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties or subcontractors to deliver the Kids’ Service or Institutional Services to our subscribers and only share your student data with our authorized, third-party vendors. Britannica is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure. Any personal information collected through the Services is stored on limited-access servers. We maintain a comprehensive information security program and seek to use commercially reasonable organizational, physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect these servers and the information they store from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss or modification. Our security measures include (among others): encryption of data; security controls that protect the entirety of Britannica’s IT infrastructure from external attack and unauthorized access; and internal policies setting out our data security approach and training for employees, including a Data Breach Notification Policy. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We strive to restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we strive to ensure that all our employees are aware of the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. If there is an unauthorized disclosure of personal information in Britannica’s possession or control, we will take steps in accordance with our written Incident Response Policy to investigate and mitigate the impact of the breach and notify affected customers in the manner required by applicable laws. Your personal information is stored by us using Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage solutions in the AWS Cloud – U.S. East (N. Virginia) Region, with backups in the AWS Cloud – Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region and Brazil (Sao Paulo) Region. We retain your information for the duration of your business relationship with us and as long as necessary to permit us to use it for the legitimate business purposes that we have communicated to you and comply with applicable law or regulations. For more information on where and how long your personal information is stored, and for more information on your rights of erasure and portability, please contact the Britannica’s data protection officer at  .

Information we collect from you will be processed in the United States and may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.  These countries may be outside your country of residence, including the United States, and may have different data protection laws than your country. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), Britannica collects and transfers personal information out of the EEA only: with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Britannica in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.

Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by emailing  .

However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clearing cookies from your browser or emailing  .

The term   was coined by Australian sociologist Judy Singer to provide an   to language that describes neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism, in a way that focuses on deficits. Singer proposed that, contrary to popular belief at the time, people with autism are not abnormal but have brains that naturally work differently, with different strengths and weaknesses. This idea has inspired a   movement to treat neurodevelopmental conditions such as  ,  , and   (ADHD) as natural and potentially valuable variations in human neurology. Although discussion of neurodiversity is most often concerned with these and other recognized neurodevelopmental conditions, in a broad sense neurodiversity   the wide spectrum of   and neurological development, as no two people experience the world exactly the same way. The neurodiversity movement is closely tied to the disability rights movement. Neurodiversity usually concerns people with neurodevelopmental conditions that cause some level of impairment (a challenge in performing some activity), sometimes called  . People with these conditions are referred to as  , whereas people without them are referred to as  . Some neurodivergent people may experience significant disability because of their impairments, whereas others may not, and some may perceive themselves as disabled only in relation to a society organized for neurotypical people that does not meet their needs (the social model of disability). The neurodiversity movement and the disability rights movement are aligned in believing that no level of disability diminishes a person’s humanity and that disability should never be stigmatized as a flaw. Neurodivergent people face a variety of challenges, but they also may have   strengths. For example, some research has indicated that people with dyslexia tend to be better at picturing three-dimensional objects and may have brains specialized for exploration of and   to the unknown. Far from being a developmental failure, dyslexia may have been—and may still be—important to humanity’s success. While maintaining that no one’s neurodivergence needs to be justified by a special benefit, the neurodiversity movement seeks to view neurodivergence in a more complete way, rather than focusing solely on impairments. Though   is not a medical term, and the movement often objects to medicalizing natural human differences, its principles have been widely influential on the clinical treatment of neurodivergent individuals. The neurodiversity movement is most strongly linked with   and the autism spectrum. Neurodivergencies on the autism spectrum generally involve some combination of differences in socialization, communication, sensory processing, and behaviour. Many people with autism have   that require treatment, but people on the autism spectrum frequently report that treatment for autism is too focused on promoting neurotypical behaviour and socialization. The neurodiversity movement’s view that the neurological differences and behaviours linked to autism are differences rather than problems in and of themselves suggests focusing treatment on those traits of autism that cause the individual distress, rather than assuming that any difference from “normal” behaviour is undesirable. As with many other forms of neurodiversity, there is evidence that autism is linked to high skill in certain areas, such as memorization, and that the genetic traits underlying autism have been advantageous in  .  (ADHD) is a condition featuring patterns of inattention and hyperactivity. ADHD has been the subject of considerable controversy. Its prevalence and the culturally determined nature of the   have led many people to suggest that ADHD is not a disorder or deficiency but simply a difference in personality. Some neurodiversity activists have promoted an alternative   of traditional ADHD behaviours, called variable attention stimulus trait (VAST). This alternative conception recognizes that people diagnosed with ADHD often have an abundance of attention, rather than a deficit, but experience difficulties in how they focus that attention. There is evidence that people with ADHD tend to experience some benefits of the condition, including creativity, spontaneity, and the ability to hyperfocus on certain tasks. Other neurodivergencies include specific neurodevelopmental learning difficulties, such as dyslexia (difficulty learning to read and spell), dyscalculia (difficulty understanding information communicated in numbers and mathematics), and dysgraphia (difficulty writing). Dyspraxia, sometimes called developmental coordination disorder (DCD), is a neurodevelopmental difficulty with movement and coordination. Many other conditions are sometimes included under the neurodivergent umbrella.

Some philosophers regarded it as a kind of substance, or “mental stuff,” quite different from the material substance of the physical world. Others   of it as an attribute characterized by   and voluntary movement, which separated animals and men from lower forms of life and also described the difference between the normal waking state of animals and men and their condition when asleep, in a  , or under   (the latter condition was described as unconsciousness). Other descriptions included an analysis of   as a form of relationship or act of the   toward objects in nature, and a view that consciousness was a continuous field or stream of essentially mental “sense data,” roughly similar to the “ideas” of earlier   philosophers. The method employed by most early writers in observing consciousness was  —looking within one’s own mind to discover the laws of its operation. The limitations of the method became apparent when it was found that because of differing preconceptions, trained observers in the laboratory often could not agree on fundamental observations. The failure of introspection to reveal consistent laws led to the rejection of all mental states as proper subjects of scientific study. In behaviourist  , derived primarily from work of the American psychologist   in the early 1900s, the   of consciousness was irrelevant to the objective investigation of   and was doctrinally ignored in research. Neobehaviourists, however, adopted a more liberal posture toward mentalistic states such as consciousness. That consciousness depends on the function of the brain has been known from ancient times. Although detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms of consciousness has not been achieved, correlations between states of consciousness and functions of the brain are possible. Levels of consciousness in terms of levels of alertness or responsiveness are correlated with patterns of electrical activity of the brain ( ) recorded by an electroencephalograph. During wide-awake consciousness the pattern of brain waves consists of rapid irregular waves of low   or voltage. In contrast, during  , when consciousness can be said to be minimal, the brain waves are much slower and of greater amplitude, often coming in periodic bursts of slow waxing and waning amplitude. Both behavioral levels of consciousness and the correlated patterns of electrical activity are related to the function of a part of the brainstem called the  . Electrical stimulation of the ascending reticular systems arouses a sleeping cat to alert consciousness and simultaneously activates its brain waves to the waking pattern. It was once supposed that the neurophysiological mechanisms subserving consciousness and the higher mental processes must reside in the  . It is more likely, however, that the cortex serves the more specialized functions of   patterns of sensory experience and organizing motor patterns and that the ascending reticular system represents the neural structures most critically related to consciousness. The brainstem reticular formation should not, however, be called the seat of consciousness. It represents an integrative focus, functioning through its widespread interconnections with the cortex and other regions of the brain.    ;  .

Even though termites are not closely related to ants, they are sometimes referred to as white ants. Phylogenetic studies have shown that the closest relative to the termite is the cockroach; for this reason termites are sometimes placed in the order Dictyoptera, which also contains the mantids. Termites, which number about 2,750  , are distributed widely, reaching their greatest   in numbers and species in tropical rainforests around the world (   ). In   termites are found as far north as Vancouver,   ( ), on the Pacific coast, and Maine and eastern Canada ( ) on the Atlantic coast. In   the northern limit of natural distribution is reached by   on the Atlantic coast of France, although an introduced species,  , occurs as far north as Hamburg, Germany. The known European species of termites have a predominantly Mediterranean distribution and do not occur naturally in Great Britain, Scandinavia,  , Germany, or northern Russia. In the Far East   ranges as far north as  , Peking, and northern Japan. Termites occur also in the Cape region of  ,  , Tasmania, and  . In addition to naturally occurring termites, many species have been inadvertently transported by humans from their native habitats to new parts of the world. Termites, particularly   and  , have been accidentally transported in   articles such as shipping crates, boat timbers, lumber, and furniture. Because dry-wood termites (  species) live in small colonies in wood and   long periods of dryness, they can survive in seasoned wood and furniture and can easily be   over long distances. Members of the family Rhinotermitidae ( ) require access to moisture and cannot survive prolonged dry periods.  , widely distributed in Japan, Taiwan, and South China, has been introduced into   (Ceylon), the Pacific islands, South Africa,  , Hawaii, California, and the southern  .   is unusual for the family in that it can survive without direct soil contact as long as a moisture source is present. In the United States the species has been found to have well-established colonies in the upper reaches of buildings, using small leaks in the roof as a moisture source. A termite native to the United States,  , was found in the hothouses of the Royal Palace in Schönbrunn, in Vienna, and the species was reported and described in that location before it was discovered in the United States. The termites presumably had been shipped from North America in wooden containers of decorative potted plants. Termites are important in two ways. They are destructive when they feed upon, and often destroy, wooden structures or vegetable matter valuable to humans. Introduced species, because they are not so well equipped as native species to adapt to changes in their new  , tend to seek shelter in protected, man-made environments such as buildings and thus are likely to become the most serious  , causing significant damage to houses and wooden furnishings. Some termites feed on living plant materials and can become serious crop pests. Termites are also extremely   in that they help to convert plant   into substances that can be recycled into the ecosystem to support new growth. Although only about 10 percent of the 2,750 known termite species have been reported as pests, many of these cause severe and extremely costly damage. For effective control, it is essential to determine whether the pest is a subterranean or a wood-dwelling species, as treatment methods differ.  are dependent on contact with soil moisture and normally reach the wood in man-made structures through the foundations. The most common traditional control used around a structure is to flood a shallow trench with an insecticide and cover it with soil. Insecticides also are useful around cracks and crevices in foundations. A recent development has been to establish permanent monitoring stations around the perimeter of a foundation. When termites are discovered in a station, the wooden “bait” is replaced with a cellulose material containing a chitin inhibitor that is   by the foraging workers and returned to the colony and fed to others. This material disrupts normal formation of the exoskeleton (cuticle) of   workers (the only caste capable of molting), resulting in death of the workers and, eventually, the rest of the colony. Construction and design practices that can prevent the initial entry of subterranean termites into a structure include the use of pressure-treated wood, treated concrete foundation blocks, and   foundations that extend at least 15.2 cm (6 inches) above the ground and have no cracks or contact with any outside wood. Removal of scrap lumber from building sites will also reduce the termite population.  nest in the wood on which they feed and do not invade a structure from the soil. Because their colonies are within the structure, they are difficult to control. Preventive measures include the use of chemically treated wood in   and the use of paint or other durable finish to seal cracks in wood surfaces. Fumigation is the most effective method for eliminating a dry-wood termite infestation. Another method is to place insecticide into small holes drilled into galleries of infested wood.

Within the next century or two, we   are likely to upgrade ourselves into gods and change the most basic principles of the evolution of life.

In the coming two centuries we will probably learn how to engineer and manufacture various life forms according to our wishes. We will use   in order to create new kinds of organic beings; we will use direct brain-computer interfaces in order to create cyborgs (beings that combine organic and inorganic parts); and advances in machine learning and   might even allow us to set in motion the creation of completely inorganic beings. The main products of the future economy will not be food, textiles, and vehicles but rather bodies, brains, and minds. This will be not just the greatest revolution in history but the greatest revolution in biology since the appearance of life on Earth. For four billion years life was governed by the laws of natural selection. During all these eons, whether you were a virus or a dinosaur, you evolved according to the principles of natural selection. In addition, no matter what strange and bizarre shapes life took, it remained confined to the organic realm. Whether a cactus or a whale, you were made of organic compounds and you remained subject to the laws of organic chemistry. In the next two centuries, however, science could be ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds—but   intelligent design and the intelligent design of our cloud computing. In the process,   itself will likely disappear. In 200 years Earth will probably be dominated by entities more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals or chimpanzees. Today we still share with Neanderthals and chimpanzees most of our bodily structures, physical abilities, and mental faculties. Not only are our hands, eyes, and brains distinctly hominid, but so are our lust, our love, our anger, and our social bonds. Within 200 years the combination of   and AI might result in bodily, physical, and mental traits that completely break free of the hominid mold. For example, brain-computer interfaces could result in distributed bodies—beings whose organs are spread widely in space. Some believe that consciousness might be severed from any organic structure and could surf cyberspace free of traditional biological and physical constraints. On the other hand, we might witness the decoupling of intelligence from  .   is the ability to solve problems. Consciousness is the ability to feel things, such as pain, joy, love, and anger. In mammals the two go together. Mammals solve problems by feeling things. But computers are very different. So far the amazing development of computer intelligence has not been accompanied by any development of computer consciousness. There might be several alternative ways leading to  superintelligence, only some of which pass through the straits of consciousness. For millions of years mammalian evolution has been slowly sailing along the conscious route. The evolution of inorganic life forms, however, may completely bypass these narrow straits, charting a different and much quicker course to superintelligence. We might end up with a world dominated by superintelligent but completely  nonconscious  entities.  Encyclopædia Britannica Anniversary Edition: 250 Years of Excellence (1768–2018).

The larva lives in a vertical burrow, which is sometimes as much as 0.67 metre (2 feet) deep. It waits at the top of the burrow for prey, which usually consists of insects and spiders. It lunges out and grasps the prey with sicklelike mandibles (jaws). A pair of hooks on the abdomen anchor the larva, so that it cannot be pulled out of its burrow by the struggling victim. The prey is then dragged to the bottom of the burrow and eaten. The slender, long-legged adults are about 10 to 20 mm (  to   inch) long and have bulging eyes that provide a   sense of vision.

Molting is initiated when sensory   in the body wall detect that the internal soft tissues have filled the old   and trigger production of a hormone from neurosecretory cells in the  . This hormone acts upon the  , an endocrine gland in the prothorax, which in turn secretes the molting hormone, a steroid known as  . Molting hormone then acts on the  , stimulating growth and   formation.   likewise is controlled by a hormone. Throughout the young larval stages a small gland behind the brain, called the  , secretes   (also known as neotenin). As long as this hormone is present in the   the molting epidermal cells lay down a larval cuticle. In the last larval stage, juvenile hormone is no longer produced, and the insect undergoes metamorphosis into an  . Among holometabolous insects the   develops in the presence of a very small amount of juvenile hormone. Although a state of arrested development may occur during any stage,   occurs most commonly in pupae. In   latitudes many insects overwinter in the pupal stage (e.g.,  ). The immediate cause of diapause, failure to secrete the growth and molting hormones, usually is induced by a decrease in daylength as summer wanes. In addition to changes in form during development, many insects exhibit   as  . For example, the worker and reproductive   in ants and bees may be different, termites have a soldier caste as well as reproductives and persistent  , adult aphids (Homoptera) may be winged or wingless, and some butterflies show striking seasonal or  . The general interpretation of all such differences is that, although the   to develop different forms is present in the genes of every member of a given  , particular lines of development are evoked by environmental stimuli. Hormones, including perhaps juvenile hormone, may be agents for the control of such changes. The life of the adult insect is geared primarily to reproduction. Since reproduction is sexual in almost all insects, mating must be followed by impregnation of the female and   of eggs. Usually the male seeks out the female. In butterflies in which vision is important, the colour of the female in flight can attract a male of the same species. In   (Ephemeroptera) and certain   (Diptera), males dance in   to provide a visual attraction for females. In certain beetles (e.g.,   and  ) parts of the   body in the female have become modified to form a luminous organ that attracts the male. Male   and   attract females by their chirping songs, and the male   is lured by the sound emitted by the female in flight. The most important element in mating, however, is  . Most female insects secrete odorous substances called   that serve as specific attractants and excitants for males. The male likewise may produce scents that excite the female. Certain scales ( ) on the wings of many male butterflies function in this way. Assembling scents, active in small quantities, are well known in female   and   as male attractants. The queen substance in the honeybee serves the same purpose. Mating and   production require   temperatures and adequate  . The need for   is particularly important, and in insects such as   (butterflies and moths), which take only sugar and water in the adult stage, necessary protein is derived from larval reserves. Temperature and nutrition often influence hormone secretion. Juvenile hormone or hormones from the neurosecretory cells commonly are needed for egg production. In the absence of these hormones reproduction is arrested, and the insect enters a reproductive diapause. This phenomenon occurs in   of genus   during the winter. A few insects (e.g., the    ) rarely produce males, and the eggs develop without fertilization in a process known as  . During summer months in temperate latitudes, aphids occur only as parthenogenetic females in which embryos develop within the mother ( ). In certain   (Diptera) oocytes start developing parthenogenetically in the ovaries of the larvae, and the young larvae escape by destroying the body of their mother in a process called  . Insects have an elaborate system of sense organs.    , concentrated on the antennae, palps, legs, and tarsi, cover the entire body surface. The hairs serve to inform the insect about its surroundings and its body position (a phenomenon known as  ). For example, contact between the hairs on the feet and the ground   movement and may lead to a state of rest in some insects. Modified mechanical sense organs in the cuticle called  campaniform organs detect bending strains in the integument. Such organs exist in the wings and enable the insect to control flight movements. Campaniform organs, well developed in small clublike   (the modified hind wings of dipterans), serve as strain gauges and enable the   to control its   in flight. Exceedingly sensitive organs called   are concentrated in organs of hearing. These can be found on the bushy antennae of the male mosquito or tympanal organs in the front legs of crickets or in abdominal pits of grasshoppers and many moths. In moths these sensitive organs can perceive the high-pitched sounds emitted by   as they hunt by  . Insects complement organs of   with sound-producing organs, which usually are (as in crickets) wing membranes that vibrate in response to movement of a stiff rod across a row of   teeth. Sometimes (as in  ) a timbal (membrane) in the wall of the   is set in   by a rapidly contracting muscle attached to it. Chemical perceptions by the thin-walled sensilla may be comparable to the   sense of   or  . Many insect   are specialized according to specific behaviour patterns. For example, although approximately equivalent to humans in the perception of flower odours and sugar sweetness, honeybees are exceedingly sensitive to the queen substance, which is scentless to humans. And male silkworm moths are excited by infinitesimal traces of the female sex  , even in the presence of odours that are intensely strong to humans. Although the insect eye provides less clarity than the  , insects can form adequate visual impressions of their surroundings. Insects have good  , with colour perception extending (as in ants and bees) into the ultraviolet, although it often fails to extend into the deep red. Many flowers have patterns of ultraviolet reflection invisible to the human eye but visible to the insect eye. The insect orients itself by responding to the   it receives. Formerly, insect behaviour was described as a series of movements in response to stimuli. That   has been supplanted by one that holds that the insect has a   with built-in patterns of behaviour or   that can be triggered by environmental stimuli. These responses are modified by the insect’s internal state, which has been affected by preceding stimuli. Patterns of behaviour range from comparatively simple   responses (e.g., the avoidance of adverse stimuli, the grasping of a rough surface on contact with the claws) to elaborate behavioral sequences (e.g., searching for mates, courtship, mating, and locating egg laying sites; hunting, capturing, and eating prey). The highest developments of behaviour, found in   such as the ants, bees, and termites, are based on the   principle. An interesting example of a behavioral pattern is that found in the    . The female   first locates a site for her nest in rotten wood and shapes the nest into a long tunnel. She then seeks out a preferred shrub from which pieces of leaves are gathered to build a cell. She first cuts a disc for a cell cap and then a series of oval pieces for the walls. After preparing the nest, she provisions it with a mixture of   and  , lays an egg, and then closes the cell with more cut leaves. The leaf-cutter bee repeats this sequence until the nest is filled. Each act can be performed only in this set sequence. The insect does not stop to repair any damage to the nest but proceeds undeterred to the next step in her behavioral pattern.  behaviours are more flexible than those of the leaf-cutter bee. Behavioral sequences of individuals are predictable, but the choice of acts or duties within the hive can be influenced by the needs of the colony. Honeybees exhibit capacity for   (e.g., interpreting the waggle dance, learning flower colours), which is important in any insect that has to find its nest. Although these behaviours are necessary for both colony and food source location, learning capacity plays a relatively small part in the overall pattern of honeybee behaviour. Experimental studies of details of behaviour have provided significant information about the properties of the sense organs. These studies also have provided information on the ability of insects to learn from their experience in the  .

Mature females are usually wingless and saclike, whereas the males have large, fanlike hindwings, short, clublike forewings, bulging eyes, and comblike antennae. The bristly and long-legged   larvae are picked up from a flower by bees and transported to a   nest, where they penetrate bee larvae and live as parasites first within the larva and later in the adult bee. The   female remains permanently in the puparium formed from the last larval skin inside the host except for its head, which   from the mature bee’s abdomen. The male comes out of the host as a winged adult and locates and fertilizes the female through an opening in the puparium beneath her head. The young develop inside the female, emerge through the same opening, and are carried to a flower by the bee. Although bees so parasitized live an almost normal life span, their reproductive organs do not develop. Some authorities classify these insects in the   family  .

					 ,  (class Insecta or Hexapoda),  any member of the largest class of the phylum  , which is itself the largest of the   phyla. Insects have   bodies, jointed legs, and external skeletons ( ). Insects are distinguished from other arthropods by their body, which is divided into three major regions: (1) the  , which bears the  , eyes, and a pair of antennae, (2) the three-segmented  , which usually has three pairs of legs (hence “Hexapoda”) in adults and usually one or two pairs of wings, and (3) the many-segmented  , which contains the digestive, excretory, and reproductive organs. In a popular sense, “insect” usually refers to familiar pests or disease carriers, such as  ,  , clothes moths,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and hornets, or to   groups, such as  ,  , and beetles. Many insects, however, are   from a   viewpoint; they pollinate plants, produce useful substances, control   insects, act as scavengers, and serve as food for other animals (   ). Furthermore, insects are valuable objects of study in elucidating many aspects of   and  . Much of the scientific knowledge of   has been gained from   experiments and of population biology from flour beetle studies. Insects are often used in investigations of hormonal action, nerve and sense organ function, and many other physiological processes. Insects are also used as environmental quality indicators to assess water quality and soil contamination and are the basis of many studies of  . In numbers of   and individuals and in adaptability and wide distribution, insects are perhaps the most eminently successful group of all animals. They dominate the present-day land fauna with about 1 million described species. This represents about three-fourths of all described animal species. Entomologists estimate the actual number of living insect species could be as high as 5 million to 10 million. The orders that contain the greatest numbers of species are   ( ),   (butterflies and  ),   ( , bees,  ), and   (true flies). The majority of insects are small, usually less than 6 mm (0.2 inch) long, although the range in size is wide. Some of the   and parasitic wasps are almost microscopic, while some tropical forms such as the hercules beetles, African goliath beetles, certain Australian stick insects, and the wingspan of the hercules   can be as large as 27 cm (10.6 inches). In many species the difference in body structure between the sexes is pronounced, and knowledge of one sex may give few clues to the appearance of the other sex. In some, such as the twisted-wing insects ( ), the female is a mere inactive bag of eggs, and the winged male is one of the most active insects known. Modes of reproduction are quite  , and reproductive capacity is generally high. Some insects, such as the  , feed only in the immature or larval stage and go without food during an extremely short   life. Among social insects, queen termites may live for up to 50 years, whereas some adult mayflies live less than two hours. Some insects advertise their presence to the other sex by flashing lights, and many imitate other insects in colour and form and thus avoid or minimize attack by predators that feed by day and find their   visually, as do birds, lizards, and other insects. Behaviour is diverse, from the almost   parasitic forms, whose   lie in the nutrient bloodstreams of their hosts and feed by absorption, to   that pursue victims in the air,   that outrun prey on land, and predaceous water beetles that outswim prey in water. In some cases the adult insects make elaborate preparations for the young, in others the mother alone defends or feeds her young, and in still others the young are supported by complex insect societies. Some colonies of social insects, such as tropical   and  , may reach populations of millions of inhabitants.

The shock may range from an unpleasant but harmless jolt of static  , received after one has walked over a thick carpet on a dry day, to a lethal   from a power line. The great majority of deaths occur from   at house-current frequencies of 60   (cycles per second) in   and 50 hertz in Europe. Most of the deaths occur from contact with   at less than 500 volts. That is not to say that high voltages are less dangerous, but they are generally present only on apparatus and supply lines operated by utility companies, which attempt to ensure that only trained and authorized persons have access to them. The effects of electric shock on the   depend on the current that flows—the amperage—rather than on the force of the current, or voltage. The   of the human body is variable and may in fact alter considerably during the passage of an electric shock. Therefore, except in broad terms, applied voltage is not a  . This leads to difficulties in the investigation of accidents, for the electrical engineer is often able to state only the voltage applied, but the physician thinks in terms of the current that flowed. Another important consideration is the path that the current takes through the body. Looked at as an electrical conductor, the body behaves as a solution of   in a leathery container. The greatest current density therefore occurs along the axis joining the two points of contact. As the distance perpendicular to the line of current flow increases, the density of current rapidly falls off. Thus, the   most likely to be affected are those that lie close to the direct path of the current. As the great majority of electrical fatalities are due to currents passing between an arm (usually the right) and the legs, the current passes through the chest and affects the organs within it. Except in those extremely unusual accidents in which the head makes one of the points of contact, the   does not lie on or near the pathway of the current. An electric shock may directly cause   in three ways:   of the breathing centre in the brain, paralysis of the  , or   (uncontrolled, extremely rapid twitching of the heart muscle). It is generally believed that ventricular fibrillation is the most common cause of death in electric shock.  (CPR) is the best emergency first-aid   for victims of electrical shock. It is a highly effective technique when applied by a well-trained person and can, in many cases, provide adequate short-term life support until more sophisticated treatment is available. Although the great majority of victims of electric shock, excluding those who have been burned, either die or recover completely, a very small number suffer from aftereffects, which may be temporary but are sometimes permanent. These may include   of the eye, a form of   (attacks of pain beneath the breastbone), or various disorders of the  . A variety of other conditions have been reported, but, in most cases, their exact relationship to the electrical accident is unclear or cannot be clinically  .

Although many winged insects are commonly called flies, the name is strictly applicable only to members of Diptera. One of the largest   orders, it numbers more than 125,000 species that are relatively small, with soft bodies. Although the mouthparts of flies are of the sucking type, individuals show considerable variation in structure. Many flies are of great economic importance. Some bloodsuckers are serious pests of humans and other  . These insects, along with many scavenging flies, are important vectors of disease, whereas others are pests of    . Flies are  , too, functioning as scavengers, predators, or parasites of certain insect pests, as pollinators of plants, and as destroyers of   noxious to humans. Dipterous larvae, often called   or grubs, are found in many habitats (e.g., in any kind of water, in plant tissue and  , beneath   or stones, in decaying plant and   matter, even in pools of crude  ). Adults feed on plant or animal juices or other insects. Diptera fall into three large groups:   (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ),   (e.g.,  ,  ,  ), and   (e.g., flies that breed in vegetable or animal material, both living and dead). Flies range in size from midges of little more than 1 mm to robber flies more than 7 cm long. In general, the more-primitive flies (e.g., mosquitoes, midges, fungus gnats) are fragile insects with delicate wings. The more-advanced flies (e.g.,  ,  ) are generally squat, sturdy, and bristly. They are stronger fliers than midges and gnats. Diptera are   throughout the world: in the tropics, in the subarctic, at  , and high on mountains. They colonize beaches to low-tide level, but few go into deeper water, and only one or two midges are truly marine (e.g.,   in the Pacific). On the other hand, migrating flies have been found far out to sea. The abundance, worldwide distribution, and habits of flies combine to make them a nuisance to humans. Swarms of midges are a common annoyance. Sweat flies and face flies gather around the eyes, nose, and mouth and also suck   and   from wounds and sores. Such flies move constantly from one person to the next and in so doing may at times transfer   organisms. The   ( ) can be dangerous because it moves from person to food, drink, garbage, carrion, or feces. By transferring infective organisms from   material or from infected people, houseflies are agents in transmitting  ,  ,  , summer   in children, and other intestinal  - and  -caused diseases. Eye gnats are a nuisance in warm countries. Although the larvae are plant feeders, the small active adults feed on physiological secretions, particularly those around the eyes. Other flies pierce the skin of   and feed on their blood. Mosquitoes, black flies, sand flies, biting midges, and horse flies have evolved mandibles and maxillae that are bladelike, piercing stylets. These piercing organs are developed only in females, which use blood protein in egg production. Males do not feed on blood. Other groups of flies have evolved different mechanisms for obtaining blood.  , stable flies or biting houseflies ( ), and certain parasitic flies have developed a hard drill-like labium to replace the soft spongelike one. Both males and females have evolved this labium and both feed on blood. A few flies related to the housefly have a spongy proboscis equipped with small teeth for rasping skin around   and sores to increase the flow of blood and  . Other groups (e.g., robber flies) have developed a piercing   used only against other insects. The transmission of disease that occurs through the use of piercing organs such as a proboscis is considered mechanical transmission. Disease-causing organisms in the blood can be picked up by a   inserting its proboscis into an infected person. The disease may then be transmitted to another person when their skin is pierced by the bloodsucking fly, which injects its   into the wound. Without the anticoagulant properties of this saliva, bloodsucking would be impossible since the tiny hole drilled by the proboscis would clog with clotted blood. If the mouthparts are contaminated with blood that contains microorganisms, they can be injected, along with the saliva, into another person. This is called  direct   of disease and occurs only if the fly, interrupted during a meal, finds a new victim before the microorganisms die. One   that might be spread this way is  , caused by a bacterium found in wild  . Trappers who cut themselves while skinning animals can contract the disease. In   the bacterium is transmitted also by the deer fly ( ), common in wooded trapper country. Surra, a disease of horses and camels in the   and parts of Asia, is caused by the     and is transmitted by horse flies. Trypanosomes, transmitted by  , cause   in humans and   in animals throughout tropical Africa. These trypanosomes must spend part of their   in the insect before they can infect a vertebrate. This is an example of  cyclic disease transmission. The relationship between the   organism and its two hosts, vertebrate and insect, is a result of evolutionary  . However, it is not known whether the trypanosome was originally a fly parasite that spread to humans and other vertebrates or whether it was a human parasite that became adapted to living in a biting fly. An important cyclically transmitted disease is  .  , the causative agent of human malaria, is an acellular protist nourished by   in human blood. Its reproductive cycles cause recurrent bouts of the disease. Occasionally sexual forms occur in the victim’s blood. If this form finds its way into a suitable species of bloodsucking  , another stage of the   begins, preparing the organism to infect another human bitten by the mosquito host. Other diseases known to be cyclically   include  ,  ,  , and other viral diseases. Fly larvae are serious agricultural  ; they feed on young crop plants, retarding growth or killing them. Cultivated crops, because they provide pests with an almost unlimited food supply within a small area, can be devastated by uncontrolled   of a pest. On the other hand, wild food plants, because they are scattered and mixed with other varieties, do not usually provide so abundant a food supply and thus serve as a check on population growth.   can cause a 20 percent loss of an   crop, and to the   of the lost oats must be added the cost of control measures necessary to save the remainder. Some crops, notably fruit trees and ornamental shrubs, are a financial loss if slightly disfigured by insect attack, though the life of the plant is not endangered. Fruit, although edible after attack by Mediterranean  , cannot be sold; a few infested fruits can result in loss of an entire consignment.

More than 115,000 species have been described, including  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and lesser-known types. Except in the polar regions, they are abundant in most habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Collectively, the Hymenoptera are most important to humans as pollinators of wild and    , as   of destructive insects, and as makers of  . The Hymenoptera are divided into two suborders:   (mainly sawflies and horntails) and   (wasps, ants, bees, and most parasitic forms). The order includes the best known of the  —ants and some species of bees and wasps. Most species, however, are solitary in habit. Hymenopterans may be parasitic or nonparasitic, carnivorous, phytophagous, or omnivorous. Hymenopterans are chiefly small to medium-sized insects, usually with four membranous wings and a narrow waist that sets off the abdomen from the thorax, or middle region of the body. The mouthparts may be either of the biting type or of the biting-sucking type. In the higher evolutionary forms—bees, for example—mouthparts are modified into a sucking apparatus, although many also retain biting mandibles. The  , or egg-laying organ in the female, is often very long and may be modified for piercing, sawing, or stinging.   is complete; i.e., the insect develops through four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Sex is usually determined by whether or not an egg is fertilized, with fertilized eggs developing into females and unfertilized ones becoming males. Hymenoptera display an array of interesting behavioral characteristics, particularly in social species. The dancelike movements of   communicate information from one individual to another about the location, distance, quantity, and quality of a particular food source. These movements were carefully studied and described by the German entomologist  .  Trophallaxis, or the mutual exchange of food between larvae and adults of bees, ants, and wasps, has been of special interest to hymenopterists.  —the parasitic habit of one species upon another parasitic species—has also attracted attention.  , the development of many individuals (as many as 1,000) from a single egg, is an unusual phenomenon occurring in some members of the families Chalcididae and Proctotrupidae.   (production of young by females that are not fertilized by males) also occurs in some forms. Certain ants are remarkable for their relationship with insects such as aphids and scales that provide   or other sweet fluids. Ants that obtain sweet fluids from the caterpillars of certain species of blue butterflies (Lycaenidae)   by allowing the caterpillars to devour   larvae. The   (  in the  ,   in Africa) has in the nest a division of worker ants known as repletes, which are fed sugary secretions. As a consequence of high food intake, the abdomens of repletes swell into globules up to 1 cm (about 0.4 inch) in diameter. Hymenoptera, even those equipped with a sting, are sought as food by other animals. Skunks, badgers, field mice, shrews, and other animals attack   nests for the insects as well as for the honey. The larvae of the wax month ( ) live in bee nests, where they eat beeswax, thus damaging the nest. The cuckoo bee (Anthophorinae), a close relative of the  , lays its eggs in bumblebee nests, where the larvae are cared for and nourished by bumblebee workers. Hymenopterans range in size from the smallest fairyflies (Mymaridae), which are about 0.21 mm (about 0.008 inch) in length, to the largest of the Pelecinidae, which may exceed 5 cm (about 2 inches) in length. Principal differences in structure within the order include the presence or absence of wings that, when present, consist of two pairs; the presence or absence of a “waist”; modifications of the ovipositor; and   of mouthparts for specific eating habits. Polymorphism, the occurrence of two or more forms of a species, is highly developed in some of the social Hymenoptera. A   colony, for example, contains at least one queen, plus workers and drones, with each form being structurally and physiologically different from the others. Bees and wasps, as the most significant agents for the   of flowers, are found virtually everywhere that flowering plants occur. Social species may live in colonies of as many as 1,000,000 individuals. Ants are most numerous, both in numbers and in species, in tropical and subtropical regions. The number of ant species in arctic or Alpine regions is extremely small. The group appears to be   over great areas north of the  . The honeybee has been valued since pre-Christian times for its honey and beeswax. Beekeeping in modern times has become a lucrative and highly developed enterprise. Royal jelly, produced by honeybee workers, has enjoyed some popularity as a cosmetic, although its beneficial properties in this respect have not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Certain   forms are valuable control agents against insect pests. Notable among these are the parasitic wood wasps that attack wood-boring beetles; braconids that parasitize many   and wood-boring beetles; eulophids that parasitize scale insects; pteromalids that parasitize several crop pests; chalcids and trichogrammatids that parasitize a variety of orchard pests; and tiphiids that parasitize the  . Fig insects (Agaonidae) are valuable as the only pollinators of the Smyrna fig, an important crop in the Western United States. Relatively few Hymenoptera species are serious economic  . Chief among these, however, are the wheatstem   (Cephidae); some seed chalcids that are also pests of wheat; the larch sawfly ( ), which destroyed much of the larch forests in Britain and   late in the 19th century; and the European spruce sawfly ( ), which was once a serious pest in North America. In order to control the European spruce sawfly, parasitic wasps were introduced from Europe. The   ( ), accidentally introduced into the United States from  , feeds on young plants and seeds and is known to attack young mammals. The destructive habit of legionary ants, or   (Dorylinae), is of particular importance in South America. Armies of as many as 1,500,000 such insects destroy almost all   life they  .

Dogs are one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world. (  are the other.)  is a way for dogs to communicate with other dogs and with humans. Fierce barking or growling often signals that dogs are being territorial, feel threatened, or simply want to be left alone. However, dogs also bark when they are bored and want attention from other dogs or from humans. A dog may sniff other dogs’ rear ends to gather chemical information that helps the sniffer identify them as individuals.  -lined sacs, housed internally on either side of a dog’s anus, produce a scent that contributes to each dog’s unique odour profile. That profile may also indicate   makeup,   status, diet, and emotional state.  Many people have learned that one human year equals roughly seven dog years. However, this is a huge oversimplification. How a dog ages is based largely on its size and breed. Smaller dogs tend to age “slower” than larger dogs. Also, the aging rate of some breeds, such as  , differs from that of other similarly sized breeds. Beginning when dogs are six weeks old, a series of four doses of combined   against  ,  ,  , and   are given two to four weeks apart. Within one year of that series, they receive a booster, which is readministered every three years. At three months old, dogs can receive a   vaccine, which is readministered every year or every three years. Whether cities should enact breed-specific legislation (BSL, or "pit bill bans") for dogs is widely debated. Some see BSL as a humane way of making communities safer by discouraging dog fighting and the breeding of dangerous dogs. Others argue there is no evidence that BSL makes communities safer and that other legislation would be more effective than expensive and controversial BSL laws. For more on the debate on pit bull bans, visit  . ,  ( ),  domestic   of the family   (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the   ( ) and is related to   and  . The dog is one of the two most   and most popular domestic animals in the world (the   is the other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a   companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend. The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role in creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most   form of  , dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts and created new breeds as need or desire arose. Dogs are regarded differently in different parts of the world. Characteristics of loyalty, friendship, protectiveness, and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the   and Europe the care and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business. Western civilization has given the relationship between human and dog great importance, but, in some of the developing nations and in many areas of Asia, dogs are not held in the same esteem. In some areas of the world, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden or even for food, whereas in the United States and Europe dogs are protected and admired. In   during the days of the pharaohs, dogs were considered to be sacred. Paleontologists and archaeologists have determined that about 60 million years ago a small mammal, rather like a  , lived in the environs of what are now parts of Asia. It is called  , the   that became the ancestor of the animals known today as canids: dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes.   did not leave direct descendants, but doglike canids evolved from it. By about 30 to 40 million years ago   had evolved into the first true dog—namely,  . This was a medium-size  , longer than it was tall, with a long tail and a fairly brushy coat. Over the millennia   gave rise to two branches, one in Africa and the other in  . The Eurasian branch was called   and is the progenitor of wolves, dogs, and foxes. Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended directly from wolves ( ) and that the now-extinct wolf lineages that produced dogs branched off from the line that produced modern living wolves sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago. The timing and location of dog   is a matter of debate. There is strong genetic evidence, however, that the first domestication events occurred somewhere in northern Eurasia between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago. In this region wolves likely   their own domestication by trailing nomadic people in northern Eurasia and consuming the remains of game animals that hunters left behind. Most studies agree that domestication was not a single discrete event. It was a process that unfolded over thousands of years—likely involving dog populations that appeared in different parts of Eurasia at different times, with dogs and wild wolves continuing to interbreed with one another and with early dog populations being replaced by later ones. Some genetic studies have documented evidence of early domestication events in specific regions. One study   that wolves were domesticated 16,300 years ago to serve as livestock in  , whereas another reports that early dogs dating from about 12,000 to 14,000 years ago came from a small strain of   that inhabited  . Genetic evidence also reveals that dogs did not accompany the first humans to the New World more than 15,000 years ago, suggesting instead that dogs came to the Americas only some 10,000 years ago. One study even suggested that some dogs have descended not from the   but rather from the  . These dogs, found in  , might have given rise to some of the present native African breeds. No matter what their origins, all canids have certain common  . They are mammals that   live young. The females have mammary glands, and they suckle their offspring. The early breeds had erect ears and pointed or wedge-shaped muzzles, similar to the northern breeds common today. Most of the carnivores have similar dental structures, which is one way paleontologists have been able to identify them. They develop two sets of teeth, deciduous (“baby”) teeth and permanent teeth. Canids walk on their toes, in contrast to an animal like the bear, which is flat-footed and walks on its heels. Dogs, like most mammals, have body hair and are homeothermic—that is to say, they have an internal thermostat that permits them to maintain their body temperature at a constant level despite the outside temperature. Fossil remains suggest that five distinct types of dogs existed by the beginning of the   (about 4500  ). They were the mastiffs, wolf-type dogs, sight hounds (such as the Saluki or greyhound), pointing dogs, and herding dogs.

Content: Biodiversity, also called biological diversity, is the variety of life found in a place on Earth or, often, the total variety of life on Earth. A common measure of this variety, called species richness, is the count of species in an area. Biodiversity also encompasses the genetic variety within each species and the variety of ecosystems that species create. Examining counts of species is the most common method used to compare the biodiversity of various places. A second way to weigh species biodiversity is to recognize the unique biodiversity of those habitats that contain few but unusual species, such as volcanoes, thermal vents, and hot springs. In practice, biodiversity is weighted differently for different species. The pace of decline and extinctions in biodiversity has risen dramatically over the last century, as the effects of climate change increased and human activities such as agriculture, fishing, and hunting continued to encroach into more remote natural areas all over the world. The United Nations named 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity. It was a yearlong celebration intended to raise public awareness about the importance of biodiversity and the need to reinforce conservation efforts.

The term   was coined by Australian sociologist Judy Singer to provide an   to language that describes neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism, in a way that focuses on deficits.

Some neurodivergent people may experience significant disability because of their impairments, whereas others may not, and some may perceive themselves as disabled only in relation to a society organized for neurotypical people that does not meet their needs (the social model of disability). The neurodiversity movement and the disability rights movement are aligned in believing that no level of disability diminishes a person’s humanity and that disability should never be stigmatized as a flaw. Neurodivergent people face a variety of challenges, but they also may have   strengths. For example, some research has indicated that people with dyslexia tend to be better at picturing three-dimensional objects and may have brains specialized for exploration of and   to the unknown. Far from being a developmental failure, dyslexia may have been—and may still be—important to humanity’s success. While maintaining that no one’s neurodivergence needs to be justified by a special benefit, the neurodiversity movement seeks to view neurodivergence in a more complete way, rather than focusing solely on impairments. Though   is not a medical term, and the movement often objects to medicalizing natural human differences, its principles have been widely influential on the clinical treatment of neurodivergent individuals. The neurodiversity movement is most strongly linked with   and the autism spectrum. Neurodivergencies on the autism spectrum generally involve some combination of differences in socialization, communication, sensory processing, and behaviour. Many people with autism have   that require treatment, but people on the autism spectrum frequently report that treatment for autism is too focused on promoting neurotypical behaviour and socialization. The neurodiversity movement’s view that the neurological differences and behaviours linked to autism are differences rather than problems in and of themselves suggests focusing treatment on those traits of autism that cause the individual distress, rather than assuming that any difference from “normal” behaviour is undesirable. As with many other forms of neurodiversity, there is evidence that autism is linked to high skill in certain areas, such as memorization, and that the genetic traits underlying autism have been advantageous in  .  (ADHD) is a condition featuring patterns of inattention and hyperactivity. ADHD has been the subject of considerable controversy. Its prevalence and the culturally determined nature of the   have led many people to suggest that ADHD is not a disorder or deficiency but simply a difference in personality. Some neurodiversity activists have promoted an alternative   of traditional ADHD behaviours, called variable attention stimulus trait (VAST). This alternative conception recognizes that people diagnosed with ADHD often have an abundance of attention, rather than a deficit, but experience difficulties in how they focus that attention. There is evidence that people with ADHD tend to experience some benefits of the condition, including creativity, spontaneity, and the ability to hyperfocus on certain tasks. Other neurodivergencies include specific neurodevelopmental learning difficulties, such as dyslexia (difficulty learning to read and spell), dyscalculia (difficulty understanding information communicated in numbers and mathematics), and dysgraphia (difficulty writing). Dyspraxia, sometimes called developmental coordination disorder (DCD), is a neurodevelopmental difficulty with movement and coordination. Many other conditions are sometimes included under the neurodivergent umbrella.

Within the next century or two, we   are likely to upgrade ourselves into gods and change the most basic principles of the evolution of life. Traditional mythologies depicted gods as powerful beings that could design and create life according to their wishes. In the coming two centuries we will probably learn how to engineer and manufacture various life forms according to our wishes. We will use   in order to create new kinds of organic beings; we will use direct brain-computer interfaces in order to create cyborgs (beings that combine organic and inorganic parts); and advances in machine learning and   might even allow us to set in motion the creation of completely inorganic beings. The main products of the future economy will not be food, textiles, and vehicles but rather bodies, brains, and minds. This will be not just the greatest revolution in history but the greatest revolution in biology since the appearance of life on Earth. For four billion years life was governed by the laws of natural selection. During all these eons, whether you were a virus or a dinosaur, you evolved according to the principles of natural selection. In addition, no matter what strange and bizarre shapes life took, it remained confined to the organic realm. Whether a cactus or a whale, you were made of organic compounds and you remained subject to the laws of organic chemistry. In the next two centuries, however, science could be ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds—but   intelligent design and the intelligent design of our cloud computing. In the process,   itself will likely disappear. In 200 years Earth will probably be dominated by entities more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals or chimpanzees. Today we still share with Neanderthals and chimpanzees most of our bodily structures, physical abilities, and mental faculties. Not only are our hands, eyes, and brains distinctly hominid, but so are our lust, our love, our anger, and our social bonds. Within 200 years the combination of   and AI might result in bodily, physical, and mental traits that completely break free of the hominid mold. For example, brain-computer interfaces could result in distributed bodies—beings whose organs are spread widely in space. Some believe that consciousness might be severed from any organic structure and could surf cyberspace free of traditional biological and physical constraints. On the other hand, we might witness the decoupling of intelligence from  .   is the ability to solve problems. Consciousness is the ability to feel things, such as pain, joy, love, and anger. In mammals the two go together. Mammals solve problems by feeling things. But computers are very different. So far the amazing development of computer intelligence has not been accompanied by any development of computer consciousness. There might be several alternative ways leading to  superintelligence, only some of which pass through the straits of consciousness. For millions of years mammalian evolution has been slowly sailing along the conscious route. The evolution of inorganic life forms, however, may completely bypass these narrow straits, charting a different and much quicker course to superintelligence. We might end up with a world dominated by superintelligent but completely  nonconscious  entities.  Encyclopædia Britannica Anniversary Edition: 250 Years of Excellence (1768–2018).

Some philosophers regarded it as a kind of substance, or “mental stuff,” quite different from the material substance of the physical world. Others   of it as an attribute characterized by   and voluntary movement, which separated animals and men from lower forms of life and also described the difference between the normal waking state of animals and men and their condition when asleep, in a  , or under   (the latter condition was described as unconsciousness). Other descriptions included an analysis of   as a form of relationship or act of the   toward objects in nature, and a view that consciousness was a continuous field or stream of essentially mental “sense data,” roughly similar to the “ideas” of earlier   philosophers. The method employed by most early writers in observing consciousness was  —looking within one’s own mind to discover the laws of its operation. The limitations of the method became apparent when it was found that because of differing preconceptions, trained observers in the laboratory often could not agree on fundamental observations. The failure of introspection to reveal consistent laws led to the rejection of all mental states as proper subjects of scientific study. In behaviourist  , derived primarily from work of the American psychologist   in the early 1900s, the   of consciousness was irrelevant to the objective investigation of   and was doctrinally ignored in research. Neobehaviourists, however, adopted a more liberal posture toward mentalistic states such as consciousness. That consciousness depends on the function of the brain has been known from ancient times. Although detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms of consciousness has not been achieved, correlations between states of consciousness and functions of the brain are possible. Levels of consciousness in terms of levels of alertness or responsiveness are correlated with patterns of electrical activity of the brain ( ) recorded by an electroencephalograph. During wide-awake consciousness the pattern of brain waves consists of rapid irregular waves of low   or voltage. In contrast, during  , when consciousness can be said to be minimal, the brain waves are much slower and of greater amplitude, often coming in periodic bursts of slow waxing and waning amplitude. Both behavioral levels of consciousness and the correlated patterns of electrical activity are related to the function of a part of the brainstem called the  . Electrical stimulation of the ascending reticular systems arouses a sleeping cat to alert consciousness and simultaneously activates its brain waves to the waking pattern. It was once supposed that the neurophysiological mechanisms subserving consciousness and the higher mental processes must reside in the  . It is more likely, however, that the cortex serves the more specialized functions of   patterns of sensory experience and organizing motor patterns and that the ascending reticular system represents the neural structures most critically related to consciousness. The brainstem reticular formation should not, however, be called the seat of consciousness. It represents an integrative focus, functioning through its widespread interconnections with the cortex and other regions of the brain.    ;  .

Genetics forms one of the central pillars of   and overlaps with many other areas, such as agriculture,  , and  . Since the dawn of civilization, humankind has recognized the influence of heredity and applied its principles to the improvement of   crops and domestic animals. A Babylonian tablet more than 6,000 years old, for example, shows  s of horses and indicates possible inherited characteristics. Other old carvings show cross-  of   trees. Most of the mechanisms of heredity, however, remained a mystery until the 19th century, when genetics as a systematic   began. Genetics arose out of the identification of genes, the fundamental units responsible for heredity. Genetics may be defined as the study of  s at all levels, including the ways in which they act in the   and the ways in which they are transmitted from parents to offspring. Modern genetics focuses on the chemical substance that genes are made of, called deoxyribonucleic acid, or  , and the ways in which it affects the chemical reactions that   the living processes within the cell. Gene action depends on interaction with the  . Green  s, for example, have genes containing the information necessary to synthesize the photosynthetic pigment   that gives them their green colour. Chlorophyll is synthesized in an environment containing light because the gene for chlorophyll is expressed only when it interacts with light. If a plant is placed in a dark environment, chlorophyll synthesis stops because the gene is no longer expressed. Genetics as a scientific   stemmed from the work of   in the middle of the 19th century. Mendel suspected that traits were inherited as discrete units, and, although he knew nothing of the physical or chemical nature of genes at the time, his units became the basis for the development of the present understanding of heredity. All present research in genetics can be traced back to Mendel’s discovery of the laws governing the inheritance of traits. The word   was introduced in 1905 by English biologist  , who was one of the discoverers of Mendel’s work and who became a champion of Mendel’s principles of inheritance. Although scientific evidence for patterns of genetic inheritance did not appear until Mendel’s work, history shows that humankind must have been interested in heredity long before the dawn of civilization. Curiosity must first have been based on   family resemblances, such as similarity in body structure, voice, gait, and gestures. Such notions were instrumental in the establishment of family and royal  . Early   were interested in the qualities of the animals that they herded and domesticated and, undoubtedly, bred selectively. The first human settlements that practiced farming appear to have selected crop plants with favourable qualities. Ancient tomb paintings show racehorse breeding pedigrees containing clear depictions of the inheritance of several distinct physical traits in the horses. Despite this interest, the first recorded speculations on heredity did not exist until the time of the ancient Greeks; some aspects of their ideas are still considered relevant today.  (  460–  375  ), known as the father of medicine, believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics, and, to account for this, he devised the   known as  . He postulated that all organs of the body of a parent gave off invisible “seeds,” which were like miniaturized building components and were transmitted during  , reassembling themselves in the mother’s womb to form a baby.  (384–322  ) emphasized the importance of   in heredity. He thought that the blood supplied generative material for building all parts of the adult body, and he reasoned that blood was the basis for passing on this generative power to the next generation. In fact, he believed that the male’s semen was purified blood and that a woman’s menstrual blood was her equivalent of semen. These male and female contributions united in the womb to produce a baby. The blood contained some type of hereditary essences, but he believed that the baby would develop under the influence of these essences, rather than being built from the essences themselves. Aristotle’s ideas about the role of blood in procreation were probably the origin of the still prevalent notion that somehow the blood is involved in heredity. Today people still speak of certain traits as being “in the blood” and of “blood lines” and “blood ties.” The Greek model of inheritance, in which a teeming multitude of substances was  , differed from that of the Mendelian model. Mendel’s idea was that distinct differences between individuals are determined by differences in single yet powerful hereditary factors. These single hereditary factors were identified as genes. Copies of genes are transmitted through   and egg and guide the development of the offspring. Genes are also responsible for reproducing the distinct features of both parents that are visible in their children. In the two millennia between the lives of   and  , few new ideas were recorded on the nature of  . In the 17th and 18th centuries the idea of preformation was introduced. Scientists using the newly developed s imagined that they could see miniature   of human beings inside sperm heads. French biologist   invoked the idea of “the inheritance of acquired characters,” not as an explanation for heredity but as a model for  . He lived at a time when the fixity of species was taken for granted, yet he maintained that this fixity was only found in a constant environment. He enunciated the  law of use and disuse, which states that when certain organs become specially developed as a result of some environmental need, then that state of development is hereditary and can be passed on to progeny. He believed that in this way, over many generations,  s could arise from deerlike animals that had to keep stretching their necks to reach high leaves on trees. British naturalist   originally   the theory of evolution by  . However,  ’s observations during his circumnavigation of the globe aboard the HMS   (1831–36) provided evidence for natural selection and his suggestion that humans and animals shared a common ancestry. Many scientists at the time believed in a hereditary mechanism that was a version of the ancient Greek idea of pangenesis, and Darwin’s ideas did not appear to fit with the theory of heredity that sprang from the experiments of Mendel.

					 Both   and   are controlled by hormones. Molting is initiated when sensory   in the body wall detect that the internal soft tissues have filled the old   and trigger production of a hormone from neurosecretory cells in the  . This hormone acts upon the  , an endocrine gland in the prothorax, which in turn secretes the molting hormone, a steroid known as  . Molting hormone then acts on the  , stimulating growth and   formation.   likewise is controlled by a hormone. Throughout the young larval stages a small gland behind the brain, called the  , secretes   (also known as neotenin). As long as this hormone is present in the   the molting epidermal cells lay down a larval cuticle. In the last larval stage, juvenile hormone is no longer produced, and the insect undergoes metamorphosis into an  . Among holometabolous insects the   develops in the presence of a very small amount of juvenile hormone. Although a state of arrested development may occur during any stage,   occurs most commonly in pupae. In   latitudes many insects overwinter in the pupal stage (e.g.,  ). The immediate cause of diapause, failure to secrete the growth and molting hormones, usually is induced by a decrease in daylength as summer wanes. In addition to changes in form during development, many insects exhibit   as  . For example, the worker and reproductive   in ants and bees may be different, termites have a soldier caste as well as reproductives and persistent  , adult aphids (Homoptera) may be winged or wingless, and some butterflies show striking seasonal or  . The general interpretation of all such differences is that, although the   to develop different forms is present in the genes of every member of a given  , particular lines of development are evoked by environmental stimuli. Hormones, including perhaps juvenile hormone, may be agents for the control of such changes. The life of the adult insect is geared primarily to reproduction. Since reproduction is sexual in almost all insects, mating must be followed by impregnation of the female and   of eggs. Usually the male seeks out the female. In butterflies in which vision is important, the colour of the female in flight can attract a male of the same species. In   (Ephemeroptera) and certain   (Diptera), males dance in   to provide a visual attraction for females. In certain beetles (e.g.,   and  ) parts of the   body in the female have become modified to form a luminous organ that attracts the male. Male   and   attract females by their chirping songs, and the male   is lured by the sound emitted by the female in flight. The most important element in mating, however, is  . Most female insects secrete odorous substances called   that serve as specific attractants and excitants for males. The male likewise may produce scents that excite the female. Certain scales ( ) on the wings of many male butterflies function in this way. Assembling scents, active in small quantities, are well known in female   and   as male attractants. The queen substance in the honeybee serves the same purpose. Mating and   production require   temperatures and adequate  . The need for   is particularly important, and in insects such as   (butterflies and moths), which take only sugar and water in the adult stage, necessary protein is derived from larval reserves. Temperature and nutrition often influence hormone secretion. Juvenile hormone or hormones from the neurosecretory cells commonly are needed for egg production. In the absence of these hormones reproduction is arrested, and the insect enters a reproductive diapause. This phenomenon occurs in   of genus   during the winter. A few insects (e.g., the    ) rarely produce males, and the eggs develop without fertilization in a process known as  . During summer months in temperate latitudes, aphids occur only as parthenogenetic females in which embryos develop within the mother ( ). In certain   (Diptera) oocytes start developing parthenogenetically in the ovaries of the larvae, and the young larvae escape by destroying the body of their mother in a process called  . Insects have an elaborate system of sense organs.    , concentrated on the antennae, palps, legs, and tarsi, cover the entire body surface. The hairs serve to inform the insect about its surroundings and its body position (a phenomenon known as  ). For example, contact between the hairs on the feet and the ground   movement and may lead to a state of rest in some insects. Modified mechanical sense organs in the cuticle called  campaniform organs detect bending strains in the integument. Such organs exist in the wings and enable the insect to control flight movements. Campaniform organs, well developed in small clublike   (the modified hind wings of dipterans), serve as strain gauges and enable the   to control its   in flight. Exceedingly sensitive organs called   are concentrated in organs of hearing. These can be found on the bushy antennae of the male mosquito or tympanal organs in the front legs of crickets or in abdominal pits of grasshoppers and many moths. In moths these sensitive organs can perceive the high-pitched sounds emitted by   as they hunt by  . Insects complement organs of   with sound-producing organs, which usually are (as in crickets) wing membranes that vibrate in response to movement of a stiff rod across a row of   teeth. Sometimes (as in  ) a timbal (membrane) in the wall of the   is set in   by a rapidly contracting muscle attached to it. Chemical perceptions by the thin-walled sensilla may be comparable to the   sense of   or  . Many insect   are specialized according to specific behaviour patterns. For example, although approximately equivalent to humans in the perception of flower odours and sugar sweetness, honeybees are exceedingly sensitive to the queen substance, which is scentless to humans. And male silkworm moths are excited by infinitesimal traces of the female sex  , even in the presence of odours that are intensely strong to humans. Although the insect eye provides less clarity than the  , insects can form adequate visual impressions of their surroundings. Insects have good  , with colour perception extending (as in ants and bees) into the ultraviolet, although it often fails to extend into the deep red. Many flowers have patterns of ultraviolet reflection invisible to the human eye but visible to the insect eye. The insect orients itself by responding to the   it receives. Formerly, insect behaviour was described as a series of movements in response to stimuli. That   has been supplanted by one that holds that the insect has a   with built-in patterns of behaviour or   that can be triggered by environmental stimuli. These responses are modified by the insect’s internal state, which has been affected by preceding stimuli. Patterns of behaviour range from comparatively simple   responses (e.g., the avoidance of adverse stimuli, the grasping of a rough surface on contact with the claws) to elaborate behavioral sequences (e.g., searching for mates, courtship, mating, and locating egg laying sites; hunting, capturing, and eating prey). The highest developments of behaviour, found in   such as the ants, bees, and termites, are based on the   principle. An interesting example of a behavioral pattern is that found in the    . The female   first locates a site for her nest in rotten wood and shapes the nest into a long tunnel. She then seeks out a preferred shrub from which pieces of leaves are gathered to build a cell. She first cuts a disc for a cell cap and then a series of oval pieces for the walls. After preparing the nest, she provisions it with a mixture of   and  , lays an egg, and then closes the cell with more cut leaves. The leaf-cutter bee repeats this sequence until the nest is filled. Each act can be performed only in this set sequence. The insect does not stop to repair any damage to the nest but proceeds undeterred to the next step in her behavioral pattern.  behaviours are more flexible than those of the leaf-cutter bee. Behavioral sequences of individuals are predictable, but the choice of acts or duties within the hive can be influenced by the needs of the colony. Honeybees exhibit capacity for   (e.g., interpreting the waggle dance, learning flower colours), which is important in any insect that has to find its nest. Although these behaviours are necessary for both colony and food source location, learning capacity plays a relatively small part in the overall pattern of honeybee behaviour. Experimental studies of details of behaviour have provided significant information about the properties of the sense organs. These studies also have provided information on the ability of insects to learn from their experience in the  .

Even though termites are not closely related to ants, they are sometimes referred to as white ants. Phylogenetic studies have shown that the closest relative to the termite is the cockroach; for this reason termites are sometimes placed in the order Dictyoptera, which also contains the mantids. Termites, which number about 2,750  , are distributed widely, reaching their greatest   in numbers and species in tropical rainforests around the world (   ). In   termites are found as far north as Vancouver,   ( ), on the Pacific coast, and Maine and eastern Canada ( ) on the Atlantic coast. In   the northern limit of natural distribution is reached by   on the Atlantic coast of France, although an introduced species,  , occurs as far north as Hamburg, Germany. The known European species of termites have a predominantly Mediterranean distribution and do not occur naturally in Great Britain, Scandinavia,  , Germany, or northern Russia. In the Far East   ranges as far north as  , Peking, and northern Japan. Termites occur also in the Cape region of  ,  , Tasmania, and  . In addition to naturally occurring termites, many species have been inadvertently transported by humans from their native habitats to new parts of the world. Termites, particularly   and  , have been accidentally transported in   articles such as shipping crates, boat timbers, lumber, and furniture. Because dry-wood termites (  species) live in small colonies in wood and   long periods of dryness, they can survive in seasoned wood and furniture and can easily be   over long distances. Members of the family Rhinotermitidae ( ) require access to moisture and cannot survive prolonged dry periods.  , widely distributed in Japan, Taiwan, and South China, has been introduced into   (Ceylon), the Pacific islands, South Africa,  , Hawaii, California, and the southern  .   is unusual for the family in that it can survive without direct soil contact as long as a moisture source is present. In the United States the species has been found to have well-established colonies in the upper reaches of buildings, using small leaks in the roof as a moisture source. A termite native to the United States,  , was found in the hothouses of the Royal Palace in Schönbrunn, in Vienna, and the species was reported and described in that location before it was discovered in the United States. The termites presumably had been shipped from North America in wooden containers of decorative potted plants. Termites are important in two ways. They are destructive when they feed upon, and often destroy, wooden structures or vegetable matter valuable to humans. Introduced species, because they are not so well equipped as native species to adapt to changes in their new  , tend to seek shelter in protected, man-made environments such as buildings and thus are likely to become the most serious  , causing significant damage to houses and wooden furnishings. Some termites feed on living plant materials and can become serious crop pests. Termites are also extremely   in that they help to convert plant   into substances that can be recycled into the ecosystem to support new growth. Although only about 10 percent of the 2,750 known termite species have been reported as pests, many of these cause severe and extremely costly damage. For effective control, it is essential to determine whether the pest is a subterranean or a wood-dwelling species, as treatment methods differ.  are dependent on contact with soil moisture and normally reach the wood in man-made structures through the foundations. The most common traditional control used around a structure is to flood a shallow trench with an insecticide and cover it with soil. Insecticides also are useful around cracks and crevices in foundations. A recent development has been to establish permanent monitoring stations around the perimeter of a foundation. When termites are discovered in a station, the wooden “bait” is replaced with a cellulose material containing a chitin inhibitor that is   by the foraging workers and returned to the colony and fed to others. This material disrupts normal formation of the exoskeleton (cuticle) of   workers (the only caste capable of molting), resulting in death of the workers and, eventually, the rest of the colony. Construction and design practices that can prevent the initial entry of subterranean termites into a structure include the use of pressure-treated wood, treated concrete foundation blocks, and   foundations that extend at least 15.2 cm (6 inches) above the ground and have no cracks or contact with any outside wood. Removal of scrap lumber from building sites will also reduce the termite population.  nest in the wood on which they feed and do not invade a structure from the soil. Because their colonies are within the structure, they are difficult to control. Preventive measures include the use of chemically treated wood in   and the use of paint or other durable finish to seal cracks in wood surfaces. Fumigation is the most effective method for eliminating a dry-wood termite infestation. Another method is to place insecticide into small holes drilled into galleries of infested wood.

Some of the most pressing problems in human affairs—expanding populations, food scarcities,   including  , extinctions of   and    , and all the attendant sociological and political problems—are to a great degree ecological. The word   was coined by the German zoologist  , who applied the term   to the “relation of the animal both to its organic as well as its inorganic environment.” The word comes from the Greek  , meaning “household,” “home,” or “place to live.” Thus, ecology deals with the organism and its environment. The concept of   includes both other organisms and physical surroundings. It involves relationships between individuals within a population and between individuals of different populations. These interactions between individuals, between populations, and between organisms and their environment form ecological systems, or  s. Ecology has been defined variously as “the study of the interrelationships of organisms with their environment and each other,” as “the economy of nature,” and as “the   of ecosystems.” Ecology had no firm beginnings. It evolved from the natural history of the ancient Greeks, particularly  , a friend and associate of  . Theophrastus first described the interrelationships between organisms and between organisms and their nonliving environment. Later foundations for modern ecology were laid in the early work of plant and animal physiologists. In the early and mid-1900s two groups of botanists, one in   and the other in the  , studied plant   from two different points of view. The European botanists concerned themselves with the study of the  , structure, and distribution of plant communities. The American botanists studied the   of plant communities, or succession (   ). Both plant and animal ecology developed separately until American biologists emphasized the interrelation of both plant and animal communities as a biotic whole. During the same period, interest in     developed. The study of population dynamics received special   in the early 19th century, after the English economist   called attention to the conflict between expanding populations and the capability of   to supply food. In the 1920s the American zoologist  , the American chemist and statistician Alfred J. Lotka, and the Italian mathematician   developed mathematical foundations for the study of populations, and these studies led to experiments on the interaction of predators and  , competitive relationships between species, and the regulation of populations. Investigations of the influence of behaviour on populations were stimulated by the recognition in 1920 of territoriality in nesting birds.   of instinctive and   were developed by the Austrian zoologist   and the Dutch-born British zoologist  , and the role of social behaviour in the regulation of populations was explored by the British zoologist Vero Wynne-Edwards. (   .) While some ecologists were studying the dynamics of communities and populations, others were concerned with energy budgets. In 1920  August Thienemann, a German freshwater biologist, introduced the concept of trophic, or feeding, levels (   ), by which the energy of food is transferred through a series of organisms, from green plants (the producers) up to several levels of animals (the consumers). An English animal ecologist,   (1927), further developed this approach with the   of ecological  s and pyramids of numbers. In the 1930s, American freshwater biologists Edward Birge and Chancey Juday, in measuring the energy budgets of lakes, developed the idea of  , the rate at which food energy is generated, or fixed, by  . In 1942 Raymond L. Lindeman of the United States developed the trophic-dynamic concept of ecology, which details the flow of energy through the ecosystem. Quantified   studies of   through ecosystems were further developed by the brothers Eugene Odum and Howard Odum of the United States; similar early work on the cycling of   was done by J.D. Ovington of England and Australia. (   ;   and  .) The study of both energy flow and nutrient cycling was   by the development of new materials and techniques—radioisotope tracers, microcalorimetry,  , and applied mathematics—that enabled ecologists to label, track, and measure the movement of particular nutrients and energy through ecosystems. These modern methods (   ) encouraged a new stage in the development of ecology— , which is concerned with the structure and function of ecosystems.

The larva lives in a vertical burrow, which is sometimes as much as 0.67 metre (2 feet) deep. It waits at the top of the burrow for prey, which usually consists of insects and spiders. It lunges out and grasps the prey with sicklelike mandibles (jaws). A pair of hooks on the abdomen anchor the larva, so that it cannot be pulled out of its burrow by the struggling victim. The prey is then dragged to the bottom of the burrow and eaten. The slender, long-legged adults are about 10 to 20 mm (  to   inch) long and have bulging eyes that provide a   sense of vision. Many are iridescent blue, green, orange, or scarlet in colour. The wide range of colours is created both by pigments laid down in the exoskeleton and refractory colours created by surface characteristics of the exoskeleton. They are rapid runners and fliers that can easily capture a variety of prey. When handled, tiger beetles can inflict a painful bite with their long mandibles.

Biology is often approached on the basis of levels that deal with fundamental units of life. At the level of  , for example, life is regarded as a   of chemical and   transformations that occur among the many chemical   that compose an organism. As a result of the   of increasingly powerful and precise laboratory instruments and techniques, it is possible to understand and define with high precision and accuracy not only the ultimate physiochemical organization (ultrastructure) of the molecules in living matter but also the way living matter reproduces at the molecular level. Especially crucial to those advances was the rise of   in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  is the study of cells—the fundamental units of structure and function in living organisms.   were first observed in the 17th century, when the     was invented. Before that time, the individual organism was studied as a whole in a field known as  organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.   biology deals with groups or populations of organisms that inhabit a given area or region. Included at that level are studies of the roles that specific kinds of plants and animals play in the complex and self-perpetuating interrelationships that exist between the living and the nonliving world, as well as studies of the built-in controls that maintain those relationships naturally. Those broadly based levels— , cells, whole organisms, and populations—may be further subdivided for study, giving rise to specializations such as  ,  , biophysics, biochemistry,  ,  , and  . A field of biology may be especially concerned with the investigation of one kind of living thing—for example, the study of   in  , the study of   in  , or the study of microorganisms in  . The concept of  —that living things maintain a constant internal environment—was first suggested in the 19th century by French physiologist  , who stated that “all the vital mechanisms, varied as they are, have only one object: that of preserving constant the conditions of life.” As originally conceived by Bernard,   applied to the struggle of a single organism to survive. The concept was later extended to include any biological system from the   to the entire  , all the areas of   inhabited by living things. All living organisms, regardless of their uniqueness, have certain biological, chemical, and physical characteristics in common. All, for example, are composed of basic units known as   and of the same chemical substances, which, when analyzed, exhibit noteworthy similarities, even in such   organisms as   and  . Furthermore, since the action of any organism is determined by the manner in which its cells interact and since all cells interact in much the same way, the basic functioning of all organisms is also similar. There is not only unity of basic living substance and functioning but also unity of origin of all living things. According to a theory proposed in 1855 by German pathologist  , “all living cells arise from pre-existing living cells.” That theory appears to be true for all living things at the present time under existing environmental conditions. If, however, life originated on Earth more than once in the past, the fact that all organisms have a sameness of basic structure,  , and function would seem to indicate that only one original type succeeded. A common origin of life would explain why in humans or bacteria—and in all forms of life in between—the same chemical substance, deoxyribonucleic acid ( ), in the form of   accounts for the ability of all living matter to replicate itself exactly and to transmit genetic information from parent to offspring.

					 ,  (class Insecta or Hexapoda),  any member of the largest class of the phylum  , which is itself the largest of the   phyla. Insects have   bodies, jointed legs, and external skeletons ( ). Insects are distinguished from other arthropods by their body, which is divided into three major regions: (1) the  , which bears the  , eyes, and a pair of antennae, (2) the three-segmented  , which usually has three pairs of legs (hence “Hexapoda”) in adults and usually one or two pairs of wings, and (3) the many-segmented  , which contains the digestive, excretory, and reproductive organs. In a popular sense, “insect” usually refers to familiar pests or disease carriers, such as  ,  , clothes moths,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and hornets, or to   groups, such as  ,  , and beetles. Many insects, however, are   from a   viewpoint; they pollinate plants, produce useful substances, control   insects, act as scavengers, and serve as food for other animals (   ). Furthermore, insects are valuable objects of study in elucidating many aspects of   and  . Much of the scientific knowledge of   has been gained from   experiments and of population biology from flour beetle studies. Insects are often used in investigations of hormonal action, nerve and sense organ function, and many other physiological processes. Insects are also used as environmental quality indicators to assess water quality and soil contamination and are the basis of many studies of  . In numbers of   and individuals and in adaptability and wide distribution, insects are perhaps the most eminently successful group of all animals. They dominate the present-day land fauna with about 1 million described species. This represents about three-fourths of all described animal species. Entomologists estimate the actual number of living insect species could be as high as 5 million to 10 million. The orders that contain the greatest numbers of species are   ( ),   (butterflies and  ),   ( , bees,  ), and   (true flies). The majority of insects are small, usually less than 6 mm (0.2 inch) long, although the range in size is wide. Some of the   and parasitic wasps are almost microscopic, while some tropical forms such as the hercules beetles, African goliath beetles, certain Australian stick insects, and the wingspan of the hercules   can be as large as 27 cm (10.6 inches). In many species the difference in body structure between the sexes is pronounced, and knowledge of one sex may give few clues to the appearance of the other sex. In some, such as the twisted-wing insects ( ), the female is a mere inactive bag of eggs, and the winged male is one of the most active insects known. Modes of reproduction are quite  , and reproductive capacity is generally high. Some insects, such as the  , feed only in the immature or larval stage and go without food during an extremely short   life. Among social insects, queen termites may live for up to 50 years, whereas some adult mayflies live less than two hours. Some insects advertise their presence to the other sex by flashing lights, and many imitate other insects in colour and form and thus avoid or minimize attack by predators that feed by day and find their   visually, as do birds, lizards, and other insects. Behaviour is diverse, from the almost   parasitic forms, whose   lie in the nutrient bloodstreams of their hosts and feed by absorption, to   that pursue victims in the air,   that outrun prey on land, and predaceous water beetles that outswim prey in water. In some cases the adult insects make elaborate preparations for the young, in others the mother alone defends or feeds her young, and in still others the young are supported by complex insect societies. Some colonies of social insects, such as tropical   and  , may reach populations of millions of inhabitants.

When early man hunted animals and foraged for food, he shared the natural resources with other organisms in the  . As human   developed and population rose, people made ever-increasing demands on these resources. One result of changing the   has been a great increase in the number of species that are now recognized as competitors of humans. These competitors are usually referred to as pests. The definition of pest is, of course, subjective. An   would not necessarily consider several leaf-eating   on a plant as pests, whereas a gardener who   the plant might very well do so. And only one  ,  , or   is enough to qualify as a household pest. Natural   have always contained organisms that were economically significant; locusts, for example, have plagued humans throughout history, and grain from   locations has been found infected with   and   diseases. Most species that became pests, however, did so because of environmental modification, occasionally from natural causes but usually from human activities. In order to appreciate some of the methods devised to combat pests, one should consider how advancing   has increased the number of harmful   species. The change from natural vegetation to large areas of single-crop ( )   has three consequences. First, given a more uniform food source, some plant-eating species increase to large populations. Second, the uniform plant cover is easily invaded by attacking pests. Third, the introduction of new crops over large areas results in the transfer of previously harmless insects from scattered native plants to the new and abundant sources of food. Cultural practices such as fertilization,  , and the use of modern harvesting equipment (which often leaves large amounts of plant litter in the field)   still further the ability of pest species to increase rapidly. In addition, the elimination of species that compete with or prey upon pests—an unintended effect in some pest control programs—has also   certain pest problems. Also, the ease with which people and goods can be transported around the world has resulted in the introduction of exotic pests in many places. Pests are found throughout the   kingdom. Microorganisms such as fungi,  , and viruses are here considered with the pests even though they are usually thought of as agents of  . Most animal pests are invertebrates, among them protozoa, flatworms, nematodes, snails, slugs, insects, and mites. Among the vertebrates, rabbits, elk, deer, and many kinds of rodents are sometimes injurious to crops. Insects are also serious pests, especially those involved with the   of disease. Each year millions of lives, particularly in the tropics, are threatened by insect-borne diseases. Malaria and   are transmitted by mosquitoes,   by fleas, typhus by the  ,   by tsetse flies,   by blood-sucking bugs, and leishmaniasis by sandflies. Other diseases may be spread by insects accidentally as a result of their habits. The  , a pest responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of   in  , arrived in the   in the 1990s, probably embedded in shipping materials from eastern Asia. Pest control began to receive attention in the 18th century, and it has become increasingly important since then. As control programs were developed, they tended to fall primarily into two somewhat mutually   categories: chemical and biological. Physical or mechanical methods, including sticky barriers, heat killing (for storage pests), and flooding (for ground pests), were also developed. Because of their limited utility and short-term effectiveness, they have been superseded largely by chemical and biological methods. The chemical, or  , approach probably began with the use of poisonous plant  —ground tobacco was used in France to kill aphids about 1763. Other natural products such as nicotine, rotenone, petroleum, kerosene, creosote, and turpentine were used in the 19th century. Inorganic compounds such as Paris green, lime sulfur, Bordeaux mixture,  , and lead arsenate were also introduced in the 1800s. With the appearance of the   organic compounds during  , a dramatic change occurred in pest control. Some organic compounds, such as the dinitrophenols, had been used earlier, but the discovery of the insecticidal properties of   (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) and of BHC ( ) made the concept of pest-free crops possible. Research in the 1930s on plant hormones and related compounds led to the development of the selective   2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), and this became commercially available about the same time as DDT. Following the appearance of these new synthetic organic compounds, a whole new series of pesticides—insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and plant growth regulators—was introduced. Although the ancient Chinese used predacious ants to control foliage-feeding insects, the control of pests by biological means appears to have been initiated in the Western world with the importation of the Indian Mynah   into Mauritius in 1762 to control the red locust. Control of bedbugs by predatory agents was recommended in 1776. A number of other projects in   were carried out in the 1800s, but the modern era in this phase of pest control began in 1888 with the importation into California of the vedalia   ( ) to control the   ( ). This beetle, imported from  , saved the citrus-fruit industry. The use of plants resistant to insects was suggested about 1788 as a means of controlling the  , a pest of wheat. The classic example of this approach was the control of phylloxera, aphid-like insects that attacked the root stocks of the European wine grape and almost ruined the European wine industry. The solution lay in grafting the European wine grape onto resistant American stocks. The effort, about 1900, to control the lantana shrub in Hawaii by introducing an insect appears to have been the first attempt to control weeds biologically. The use of microorganisms to destroy insect pests began in the late 1800s and early 1900s. With the appearance of the synthetic organic insecticides, however, emphasis was placed on chemical control, and biological means fell into neglect. The extensive use of powerful chemical agents soon resulted in a number of serious ecological problems. Consequently, current pest control practice minimizes the use of pesticides and combines them with biological methods in an approach called  . The   control of an insect that attacks crops may, for example, involve the   of pest-resistant   varieties; the development of crop   methods that   pest proliferation; the release of organisms that are predators or parasites of the pest species; the placement of traps baited with the pest’s own sex attractants (pheromones); the disruption of the pest’s reproduction by the release of sterilized pests; and, often as a last resort, the application of chemical insecticides. Other important tools of modern pest control or importation and quarantine regulations, which are designed to prevent the introduction of exotic pests.

The shock may range from an unpleasant but harmless jolt of static  , received after one has walked over a thick carpet on a dry day, to a lethal   from a power line. The great majority of deaths occur from   at house-current frequencies of 60   (cycles per second) in   and 50 hertz in Europe. Most of the deaths occur from contact with   at less than 500 volts. That is not to say that high voltages are less dangerous, but they are generally present only on apparatus and supply lines operated by utility companies, which attempt to ensure that only trained and authorized persons have access to them. The effects of electric shock on the   depend on the current that flows—the amperage—rather than on the force of the current, or voltage. The   of the human body is variable and may in fact alter considerably during the passage of an electric shock. Therefore, except in broad terms, applied voltage is not a  . This leads to difficulties in the investigation of accidents, for the electrical engineer is often able to state only the voltage applied, but the physician thinks in terms of the current that flowed. Another important consideration is the path that the current takes through the body. Looked at as an electrical conductor, the body behaves as a solution of   in a leathery container. The greatest current density therefore occurs along the axis joining the two points of contact. As the distance perpendicular to the line of current flow increases, the density of current rapidly falls off. Thus, the   most likely to be affected are those that lie close to the direct path of the current. As the great majority of electrical fatalities are due to currents passing between an arm (usually the right) and the legs, the current passes through the chest and affects the organs within it. Except in those extremely unusual accidents in which the head makes one of the points of contact, the   does not lie on or near the pathway of the current.

It is generally believed that ventricular fibrillation is the most common cause of death in electric shock.  (CPR) is the best emergency first-aid   for victims of electrical shock. It is a highly effective technique when applied by a well-trained person and can, in many cases, provide adequate short-term life support until more sophisticated treatment is available. Although the great majority of victims of electric shock, excluding those who have been burned, either die or recover completely, a very small number suffer from aftereffects, which may be temporary but are sometimes permanent. These may include   of the eye, a form of   (attacks of pain beneath the breastbone), or various disorders of the  . A variety of other conditions have been reported, but, in most cases, their exact relationship to the electrical accident is unclear or cannot be clinically  .

Within the next century or two, we   are likely to upgrade ourselves into gods and change the most basic principles of the evolution of life. Traditional mythologies depicted gods as powerful beings that could design and create life according to their wishes. In the coming two centuries we will probably learn how to engineer and manufacture various life forms according to our wishes. We will use   in order to create new kinds of organic beings; we will use direct brain-computer interfaces in order to create cyborgs (beings that combine organic and inorganic parts); and advances in machine learning and   might even allow us to set in motion the creation of completely inorganic beings. The main products of the future economy will not be food, textiles, and vehicles but rather bodies, brains, and minds. This will be not just the greatest revolution in history but the greatest revolution in biology since the appearance of life on Earth. For four billion years life was governed by the laws of natural selection. During all these eons, whether you were a virus or a dinosaur, you evolved according to the principles of natural selection. In addition, no matter what strange and bizarre shapes life took, it remained confined to the organic realm. Whether a cactus or a whale, you were made of organic compounds and you remained subject to the laws of organic chemistry. In the next two centuries, however, science could be ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds—but   intelligent design and the intelligent design of our cloud computing. In the process,   itself will likely disappear. In 200 years Earth will probably be dominated by entities more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals or chimpanzees. Today we still share with Neanderthals and chimpanzees most of our bodily structures, physical abilities, and mental faculties. Not only are our hands, eyes, and brains distinctly hominid, but so are our lust, our love, our anger, and our social bonds. Within 200 years the combination of   and AI might result in bodily, physical, and mental traits that completely break free of the hominid mold. For example, brain-computer interfaces could result in distributed bodies—beings whose organs are spread widely in space. Some believe that consciousness might be severed from any organic structure and could surf cyberspace free of traditional biological and physical constraints. On the other hand, we might witness the decoupling of intelligence from  .   is the ability to solve problems. Consciousness is the ability to feel things, such as pain, joy, love, and anger. In mammals the two go together. Mammals solve problems by feeling things. But computers are very different. So far the amazing development of computer intelligence has not been accompanied by any development of computer consciousness. There might be several alternative ways leading to  superintelligence, only some of which pass through the straits of consciousness. For millions of years mammalian evolution has been slowly sailing along the conscious route. The evolution of inorganic life forms, however, may completely bypass these narrow straits, charting a different and much quicker course to superintelligence. We might end up with a world dominated by superintelligent but completely  nonconscious  entities.  Encyclopædia Britannica Anniversary Edition: 250 Years of Excellence (1768–2018).

Molting is initiated when sensory   in the body wall detect that the internal soft tissues have filled the old   and trigger production of a hormone from neurosecretory cells in the  . This hormone acts upon the  , an endocrine gland in the prothorax, which in turn secretes the molting hormone, a steroid known as  . Molting hormone then acts on the  , stimulating growth and   formation.   likewise is controlled by a hormone. Throughout the young larval stages a small gland behind the brain, called the  , secretes   (also known as neotenin). As long as this hormone is present in the   the molting epidermal cells lay down a larval cuticle. In the last larval stage, juvenile hormone is no longer produced, and the insect undergoes metamorphosis into an  . Among holometabolous insects the   develops in the presence of a very small amount of juvenile hormone. Although a state of arrested development may occur during any stage,   occurs most commonly in pupae. In   latitudes many insects overwinter in the pupal stage (e.g.,  ). The immediate cause of diapause, failure to secrete the growth and molting hormones, usually is induced by a decrease in daylength as summer wanes. In addition to changes in form during development, many insects exhibit   as  . For example, the worker and reproductive   in ants and bees may be different, termites have a soldier caste as well as reproductives and persistent  , adult aphids (Homoptera) may be winged or wingless, and some butterflies show striking seasonal or  . The general interpretation of all such differences is that, although the   to develop different forms is present in the genes of every member of a given  , particular lines of development are evoked by environmental stimuli. Hormones, including perhaps juvenile hormone, may be agents for the control of such changes. The life of the adult insect is geared primarily to reproduction. Since reproduction is sexual in almost all insects, mating must be followed by impregnation of the female and   of eggs. Usually the male seeks out the female. In butterflies in which vision is important, the colour of the female in flight can attract a male of the same species. In   (Ephemeroptera) and certain   (Diptera), males dance in   to provide a visual attraction for females. In certain beetles (e.g.,   and  ) parts of the   body in the female have become modified to form a luminous organ that attracts the male. Male   and   attract females by their chirping songs, and the male   is lured by the sound emitted by the female in flight. The most important element in mating, however, is  . Most female insects secrete odorous substances called   that serve as specific attractants and excitants for males. The male likewise may produce scents that excite the female. Certain scales ( ) on the wings of many male butterflies function in this way. Assembling scents, active in small quantities, are well known in female   and   as male attractants. The queen substance in the honeybee serves the same purpose. Mating and   production require   temperatures and adequate  . The need for   is particularly important, and in insects such as   (butterflies and moths), which take only sugar and water in the adult stage, necessary protein is derived from larval reserves. Temperature and nutrition often influence hormone secretion. Juvenile hormone or hormones from the neurosecretory cells commonly are needed for egg production. In the absence of these hormones reproduction is arrested, and the insect enters a reproductive diapause. This phenomenon occurs in   of genus   during the winter. A few insects (e.g., the    ) rarely produce males, and the eggs develop without fertilization in a process known as  . During summer months in temperate latitudes, aphids occur only as parthenogenetic females in which embryos develop within the mother ( ). In certain   (Diptera) oocytes start developing parthenogenetically in the ovaries of the larvae, and the young larvae escape by destroying the body of their mother in a process called  . Insects have an elaborate system of sense organs.    , concentrated on the antennae, palps, legs, and tarsi, cover the entire body surface. The hairs serve to inform the insect about its surroundings and its body position (a phenomenon known as  ). For example, contact between the hairs on the feet and the ground   movement and may lead to a state of rest in some insects. Modified mechanical sense organs in the cuticle called  campaniform organs detect bending strains in the integument. Such organs exist in the wings and enable the insect to control flight movements. Campaniform organs, well developed in small clublike   (the modified hind wings of dipterans), serve as strain gauges and enable the   to control its   in flight. Exceedingly sensitive organs called   are concentrated in organs of hearing. These can be found on the bushy antennae of the male mosquito or tympanal organs in the front legs of crickets or in abdominal pits of grasshoppers and many moths. In moths these sensitive organs can perceive the high-pitched sounds emitted by   as they hunt by  . Insects complement organs of   with sound-producing organs, which usually are (as in crickets) wing membranes that vibrate in response to movement of a stiff rod across a row of   teeth. Sometimes (as in  ) a timbal (membrane) in the wall of the   is set in   by a rapidly contracting muscle attached to it. Chemical perceptions by the thin-walled sensilla may be comparable to the   sense of   or  . Many insect   are specialized according to specific behaviour patterns. For example, although approximately equivalent to humans in the perception of flower odours and sugar sweetness, honeybees are exceedingly sensitive to the queen substance, which is scentless to humans. And male silkworm moths are excited by infinitesimal traces of the female sex  , even in the presence of odours that are intensely strong to humans. Although the insect eye provides less clarity than the  , insects can form adequate visual impressions of their surroundings. Insects have good  , with colour perception extending (as in ants and bees) into the ultraviolet, although it often fails to extend into the deep red. Many flowers have patterns of ultraviolet reflection invisible to the human eye but visible to the insect eye. The insect orients itself by responding to the   it receives. Formerly, insect behaviour was described as a series of movements in response to stimuli. That   has been supplanted by one that holds that the insect has a   with built-in patterns of behaviour or   that can be triggered by environmental stimuli. These responses are modified by the insect’s internal state, which has been affected by preceding stimuli. Patterns of behaviour range from comparatively simple   responses (e.g., the avoidance of adverse stimuli, the grasping of a rough surface on contact with the claws) to elaborate behavioral sequences (e.g., searching for mates, courtship, mating, and locating egg laying sites; hunting, capturing, and eating prey). The highest developments of behaviour, found in   such as the ants, bees, and termites, are based on the   principle. An interesting example of a behavioral pattern is that found in the    . The female   first locates a site for her nest in rotten wood and shapes the nest into a long tunnel. She then seeks out a preferred shrub from which pieces of leaves are gathered to build a cell. She first cuts a disc for a cell cap and then a series of oval pieces for the walls. After preparing the nest, she provisions it with a mixture of   and  , lays an egg, and then closes the cell with more cut leaves. The leaf-cutter bee repeats this sequence until the nest is filled. Each act can be performed only in this set sequence. The insect does not stop to repair any damage to the nest but proceeds undeterred to the next step in her behavioral pattern.  behaviours are more flexible than those of the leaf-cutter bee. Behavioral sequences of individuals are predictable, but the choice of acts or duties within the hive can be influenced by the needs of the colony. Honeybees exhibit capacity for   (e.g., interpreting the waggle dance, learning flower colours), which is important in any insect that has to find its nest. Although these behaviours are necessary for both colony and food source location, learning capacity plays a relatively small part in the overall pattern of honeybee behaviour. Experimental studies of details of behaviour have provided significant information about the properties of the sense organs. These studies also have provided information on the ability of insects to learn from their experience in the  .

A dog is a   mammal of the family   and the order Carnivora. Its scientific name is  . Dogs are a subspecies of the gray wolf, and they are also related to foxes and jackals. Dogs are one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world. (  are the other.)  is a way for dogs to communicate with other dogs and with humans. Fierce barking or growling often signals that dogs are being territorial, feel threatened, or simply want to be left alone. However, dogs also bark when they are bored and want attention from other dogs or from humans. A dog may sniff other dogs’ rear ends to gather chemical information that helps the sniffer identify them as individuals.  -lined sacs, housed internally on either side of a dog’s anus, produce a scent that contributes to each dog’s unique odour profile. That profile may also indicate   makeup,   status, diet, and emotional state.  Many people have learned that one human year equals roughly seven dog years. However, this is a huge oversimplification. How a dog ages is based largely on its size and breed. Smaller dogs tend to age “slower” than larger dogs. Also, the aging rate of some breeds, such as  , differs from that of other similarly sized breeds. Beginning when dogs are six weeks old, a series of four doses of combined   against  ,  ,  , and   are given two to four weeks apart. Within one year of that series, they receive a booster, which is readministered every three years. At three months old, dogs can receive a   vaccine, which is readministered every year or every three years. Whether cities should enact breed-specific legislation (BSL, or "pit bill bans") for dogs is widely debated. Some see BSL as a humane way of making communities safer by discouraging dog fighting and the breeding of dangerous dogs. Others argue there is no evidence that BSL makes communities safer and that other legislation would be more effective than expensive and controversial BSL laws. For more on the debate on pit bull bans, visit  . ,  ( ),  domestic   of the family   (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the   ( ) and is related to   and  . The dog is one of the two most   and most popular domestic animals in the world (the   is the other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a   companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend. The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role in creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most   form of  , dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts and created new breeds as need or desire arose. Dogs are regarded differently in different parts of the world. Characteristics of loyalty, friendship, protectiveness, and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the   and Europe the care and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business. Western civilization has given the relationship between human and dog great importance, but, in some of the developing nations and in many areas of Asia, dogs are not held in the same esteem. In some areas of the world, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden or even for food, whereas in the United States and Europe dogs are protected and admired. In   during the days of the pharaohs, dogs were considered to be sacred. Paleontologists and archaeologists have determined that about 60 million years ago a small mammal, rather like a  , lived in the environs of what are now parts of Asia. It is called  , the   that became the ancestor of the animals known today as canids: dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes.   did not leave direct descendants, but doglike canids evolved from it. By about 30 to 40 million years ago   had evolved into the first true dog—namely,  . This was a medium-size  , longer than it was tall, with a long tail and a fairly brushy coat. Over the millennia   gave rise to two branches, one in Africa and the other in  . The Eurasian branch was called   and is the progenitor of wolves, dogs, and foxes. Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended directly from wolves ( ) and that the now-extinct wolf lineages that produced dogs branched off from the line that produced modern living wolves sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago. The timing and location of dog   is a matter of debate. There is strong genetic evidence, however, that the first domestication events occurred somewhere in northern Eurasia between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago. In this region wolves likely   their own domestication by trailing nomadic people in northern Eurasia and consuming the remains of game animals that hunters left behind. Most studies agree that domestication was not a single discrete event. It was a process that unfolded over thousands of years—likely involving dog populations that appeared in different parts of Eurasia at different times, with dogs and wild wolves continuing to interbreed with one another and with early dog populations being replaced by later ones. Some genetic studies have documented evidence of early domestication events in specific regions. One study   that wolves were domesticated 16,300 years ago to serve as livestock in  , whereas another reports that early dogs dating from about 12,000 to 14,000 years ago came from a small strain of   that inhabited  . Genetic evidence also reveals that dogs did not accompany the first humans to the New World more than 15,000 years ago, suggesting instead that dogs came to the Americas only some 10,000 years ago. One study even suggested that some dogs have descended not from the   but rather from the  . These dogs, found in  , might have given rise to some of the present native African breeds. No matter what their origins, all canids have certain common  . They are mammals that   live young. The females have mammary glands, and they suckle their offspring. The early breeds had erect ears and pointed or wedge-shaped muzzles, similar to the northern breeds common today. Most of the carnivores have similar dental structures, which is one way paleontologists have been able to identify them. They develop two sets of teeth, deciduous (“baby”) teeth and permanent teeth. Canids walk on their toes, in contrast to an animal like the bear, which is flat-footed and walks on its heels. Dogs, like most mammals, have body hair and are homeothermic—that is to say, they have an internal thermostat that permits them to maintain their body temperature at a constant level despite the outside temperature. Fossil remains suggest that five distinct types of dogs existed by the beginning of the   (about 4500  ). They were the mastiffs, wolf-type dogs, sight hounds (such as the Saluki or greyhound), pointing dogs, and herding dogs.

Although many winged insects are commonly called flies, the name is strictly applicable only to members of Diptera. One of the largest   orders, it numbers more than 125,000 species that are relatively small, with soft bodies. Although the mouthparts of flies are of the sucking type, individuals show considerable variation in structure. Many flies are of great economic importance. Some bloodsuckers are serious pests of humans and other  . These insects, along with many scavenging flies, are important vectors of disease, whereas others are pests of    . Flies are  , too, functioning as scavengers, predators, or parasites of certain insect pests, as pollinators of plants, and as destroyers of   noxious to humans. Dipterous larvae, often called   or grubs, are found in many habitats (e.g., in any kind of water, in plant tissue and  , beneath   or stones, in decaying plant and   matter, even in pools of crude  ). Adults feed on plant or animal juices or other insects. Diptera fall into three large groups:   (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ),   (e.g.,  ,  ,  ), and   (e.g., flies that breed in vegetable or animal material, both living and dead). Flies range in size from midges of little more than 1 mm to robber flies more than 7 cm long. In general, the more-primitive flies (e.g., mosquitoes, midges, fungus gnats) are fragile insects with delicate wings. The more-advanced flies (e.g.,  ,  ) are generally squat, sturdy, and bristly. They are stronger fliers than midges and gnats. Diptera are   throughout the world: in the tropics, in the subarctic, at  , and high on mountains. They colonize beaches to low-tide level, but few go into deeper water, and only one or two midges are truly marine (e.g.,   in the Pacific). On the other hand, migrating flies have been found far out to sea. The abundance, worldwide distribution, and habits of flies combine to make them a nuisance to humans. Swarms of midges are a common annoyance. Sweat flies and face flies gather around the eyes, nose, and mouth and also suck   and   from wounds and sores. Such flies move constantly from one person to the next and in so doing may at times transfer   organisms. The   ( ) can be dangerous because it moves from person to food, drink, garbage, carrion, or feces. By transferring infective organisms from   material or from infected people, houseflies are agents in transmitting  ,  ,  , summer   in children, and other intestinal  - and  -caused diseases. Eye gnats are a nuisance in warm countries. Although the larvae are plant feeders, the small active adults feed on physiological secretions, particularly those around the eyes. Other flies pierce the skin of   and feed on their blood. Mosquitoes, black flies, sand flies, biting midges, and horse flies have evolved mandibles and maxillae that are bladelike, piercing stylets. These piercing organs are developed only in females, which use blood protein in egg production. Males do not feed on blood. Other groups of flies have evolved different mechanisms for obtaining blood.  , stable flies or biting houseflies ( ), and certain parasitic flies have developed a hard drill-like labium to replace the soft spongelike one. Both males and females have evolved this labium and both feed on blood. A few flies related to the housefly have a spongy proboscis equipped with small teeth for rasping skin around   and sores to increase the flow of blood and  . Other groups (e.g., robber flies) have developed a piercing   used only against other insects. The transmission of disease that occurs through the use of piercing organs such as a proboscis is considered mechanical transmission. Disease-causing organisms in the blood can be picked up by a   inserting its proboscis into an infected person. The disease may then be transmitted to another person when their skin is pierced by the bloodsucking fly, which injects its   into the wound. Without the anticoagulant properties of this saliva, bloodsucking would be impossible since the tiny hole drilled by the proboscis would clog with clotted blood. If the mouthparts are contaminated with blood that contains microorganisms, they can be injected, along with the saliva, into another person. This is called  direct   of disease and occurs only if the fly, interrupted during a meal, finds a new victim before the microorganisms die. One   that might be spread this way is  , caused by a bacterium found in wild  . Trappers who cut themselves while skinning animals can contract the disease. In   the bacterium is transmitted also by the deer fly ( ), common in wooded trapper country. Surra, a disease of horses and camels in the   and parts of Asia, is caused by the     and is transmitted by horse flies. Trypanosomes, transmitted by  , cause   in humans and   in animals throughout tropical Africa. These trypanosomes must spend part of their   in the insect before they can infect a vertebrate. This is an example of  cyclic disease transmission. The relationship between the   organism and its two hosts, vertebrate and insect, is a result of evolutionary  . However, it is not known whether the trypanosome was originally a fly parasite that spread to humans and other vertebrates or whether it was a human parasite that became adapted to living in a biting fly. An important cyclically transmitted disease is  .  , the causative agent of human malaria, is an acellular protist nourished by   in human blood. Its reproductive cycles cause recurrent bouts of the disease. Occasionally sexual forms occur in the victim’s blood. If this form finds its way into a suitable species of bloodsucking  , another stage of the   begins, preparing the organism to infect another human bitten by the mosquito host. Other diseases known to be cyclically   include  ,  ,  , and other viral diseases. Fly larvae are serious agricultural  ; they feed on young crop plants, retarding growth or killing them. Cultivated crops, because they provide pests with an almost unlimited food supply within a small area, can be devastated by uncontrolled   of a pest. On the other hand, wild food plants, because they are scattered and mixed with other varieties, do not usually provide so abundant a food supply and thus serve as a check on population growth.   can cause a 20 percent loss of an   crop, and to the   of the lost oats must be added the cost of control measures necessary to save the remainder. Some crops, notably fruit trees and ornamental shrubs, are a financial loss if slightly disfigured by insect attack, though the life of the plant is not endangered. Fruit, although edible after attack by Mediterranean  , cannot be sold; a few infested fruits can result in loss of an entire consignment. Larvae of   and   lower the commercial value of ornamental plants.

The term   was coined by Australian sociologist Judy Singer to provide an   to language that describes neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism, in a way that focuses on deficits. Singer proposed that, contrary to popular belief at the time, people with autism are not abnormal but have brains that naturally work differently, with different strengths and weaknesses. This idea has inspired a   movement to treat neurodevelopmental conditions such as  ,  , and   (ADHD) as natural and potentially valuable variations in human neurology. Although discussion of neurodiversity is most often concerned with these and other recognized neurodevelopmental conditions, in a broad sense neurodiversity   the wide spectrum of   and neurological development, as no two people experience the world exactly the same way. The neurodiversity movement is closely tied to the disability rights movement. Neurodiversity usually concerns people with neurodevelopmental conditions that cause some level of impairment (a challenge in performing some activity), sometimes called  . People with these conditions are referred to as  , whereas people without them are referred to as  . Some neurodivergent people may experience significant disability because of their impairments, whereas others may not, and some may perceive themselves as disabled only in relation to a society organized for neurotypical people that does not meet their needs (the social model of disability). The neurodiversity movement and the disability rights movement are aligned in believing that no level of disability diminishes a person’s humanity and that disability should never be stigmatized as a flaw. Neurodivergent people face a variety of challenges, but they also may have   strengths. For example, some research has indicated that people with dyslexia tend to be better at picturing three-dimensional objects and may have brains specialized for exploration of and   to the unknown. Far from being a developmental failure, dyslexia may have been—and may still be—important to humanity’s success. While maintaining that no one’s neurodivergence needs to be justified by a special benefit, the neurodiversity movement seeks to view neurodivergence in a more complete way, rather than focusing solely on impairments. Though   is not a medical term, and the movement often objects to medicalizing natural human differences, its principles have been widely influential on the clinical treatment of neurodivergent individuals. The neurodiversity movement is most strongly linked with   and the autism spectrum. Neurodivergencies on the autism spectrum generally involve some combination of differences in socialization, communication, sensory processing, and behaviour. Many people with autism have   that require treatment, but people on the autism spectrum frequently report that treatment for autism is too focused on promoting neurotypical behaviour and socialization. The neurodiversity movement’s view that the neurological differences and behaviours linked to autism are differences rather than problems in and of themselves suggests focusing treatment on those traits of autism that cause the individual distress, rather than assuming that any difference from “normal” behaviour is undesirable. As with many other forms of neurodiversity, there is evidence that autism is linked to high skill in certain areas, such as memorization, and that the genetic traits underlying autism have been advantageous in  .  (ADHD) is a condition featuring patterns of inattention and hyperactivity. ADHD has been the subject of considerable controversy. Its prevalence and the culturally determined nature of the   have led many people to suggest that ADHD is not a disorder or deficiency but simply a difference in personality. Some neurodiversity activists have promoted an alternative   of traditional ADHD behaviours, called variable attention stimulus trait (VAST). This alternative conception recognizes that people diagnosed with ADHD often have an abundance of attention, rather than a deficit, but experience difficulties in how they focus that attention. There is evidence that people with ADHD tend to experience some benefits of the condition, including creativity, spontaneity, and the ability to hyperfocus on certain tasks. Other neurodivergencies include specific neurodevelopmental learning difficulties, such as dyslexia (difficulty learning to read and spell), dyscalculia (difficulty understanding information communicated in numbers and mathematics), and dysgraphia (difficulty writing). Dyspraxia, sometimes called developmental coordination disorder (DCD), is a neurodevelopmental difficulty with movement and coordination. Many other conditions are sometimes included under the neurodivergent umbrella.

More than 115,000 species have been described, including  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and lesser-known types. Except in the polar regions, they are abundant in most habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Collectively, the Hymenoptera are most important to humans as pollinators of wild and    , as   of destructive insects, and as makers of  . The Hymenoptera are divided into two suborders:   (mainly sawflies and horntails) and   (wasps, ants, bees, and most parasitic forms). The order includes the best known of the  —ants and some species of bees and wasps. Most species, however, are solitary in habit. Hymenopterans may be parasitic or nonparasitic, carnivorous, phytophagous, or omnivorous. Hymenopterans are chiefly small to medium-sized insects, usually with four membranous wings and a narrow waist that sets off the abdomen from the thorax, or middle region of the body. The mouthparts may be either of the biting type or of the biting-sucking type. In the higher evolutionary forms—bees, for example—mouthparts are modified into a sucking apparatus, although many also retain biting mandibles.

Sex is usually determined by whether or not an egg is fertilized, with fertilized eggs developing into females and unfertilized ones becoming males. Hymenoptera display an array of interesting behavioral characteristics, particularly in social species. The dancelike movements of   communicate information from one individual to another about the location, distance, quantity, and quality of a particular food source. These movements were carefully studied and described by the German entomologist  .  Trophallaxis, or the mutual exchange of food between larvae and adults of bees, ants, and wasps, has been of special interest to hymenopterists.  —the parasitic habit of one species upon another parasitic species—has also attracted attention.  , the development of many individuals (as many as 1,000) from a single egg, is an unusual phenomenon occurring in some members of the families Chalcididae and Proctotrupidae.   (production of young by females that are not fertilized by males) also occurs in some forms. Certain ants are remarkable for their relationship with insects such as aphids and scales that provide   or other sweet fluids. Ants that obtain sweet fluids from the caterpillars of certain species of blue butterflies (Lycaenidae)   by allowing the caterpillars to devour   larvae. The   (  in the  ,   in Africa) has in the nest a division of worker ants known as repletes, which are fed sugary secretions. As a consequence of high food intake, the abdomens of repletes swell into globules up to 1 cm (about 0.4 inch) in diameter. Hymenoptera, even those equipped with a sting, are sought as food by other animals. Skunks, badgers, field mice, shrews, and other animals attack   nests for the insects as well as for the honey. The larvae of the wax month ( ) live in bee nests, where they eat beeswax, thus damaging the nest. The cuckoo bee (Anthophorinae), a close relative of the  , lays its eggs in bumblebee nests, where the larvae are cared for and nourished by bumblebee workers. Hymenopterans range in size from the smallest fairyflies (Mymaridae), which are about 0.21 mm (about 0.008 inch) in length, to the largest of the Pelecinidae, which may exceed 5 cm (about 2 inches) in length. Principal differences in structure within the order include the presence or absence of wings that, when present, consist of two pairs; the presence or absence of a “waist”; modifications of the ovipositor; and   of mouthparts for specific eating habits. Polymorphism, the occurrence of two or more forms of a species, is highly developed in some of the social Hymenoptera. A   colony, for example, contains at least one queen, plus workers and drones, with each form being structurally and physiologically different from the others. Bees and wasps, as the most significant agents for the   of flowers, are found virtually everywhere that flowering plants occur. Social species may live in colonies of as many as 1,000,000 individuals. Ants are most numerous, both in numbers and in species, in tropical and subtropical regions. The number of ant species in arctic or Alpine regions is extremely small. The group appears to be   over great areas north of the  . The honeybee has been valued since pre-Christian times for its honey and beeswax. Beekeeping in modern times has become a lucrative and highly developed enterprise. Royal jelly, produced by honeybee workers, has enjoyed some popularity as a cosmetic, although its beneficial properties in this respect have not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Certain   forms are valuable control agents against insect pests. Notable among these are the parasitic wood wasps that attack wood-boring beetles; braconids that parasitize many   and wood-boring beetles; eulophids that parasitize scale insects; pteromalids that parasitize several crop pests; chalcids and trichogrammatids that parasitize a variety of orchard pests; and tiphiids that parasitize the  . Fig insects (Agaonidae) are valuable as the only pollinators of the Smyrna fig, an important crop in the Western United States. Relatively few Hymenoptera species are serious economic  . Chief among these, however, are the wheatstem   (Cephidae); some seed chalcids that are also pests of wheat; the larch sawfly ( ), which destroyed much of the larch forests in Britain and   late in the 19th century; and the European spruce sawfly ( ), which was once a serious pest in North America. In order to control the European spruce sawfly, parasitic wasps were introduced from Europe. The   ( ), accidentally introduced into the United States from  , feeds on young plants and seeds and is known to attack young mammals. The destructive habit of legionary ants, or   (Dorylinae), is of particular importance in South America. Armies of as many as 1,500,000 such insects destroy almost all   life they  .

					 ,  (class Insecta or Hexapoda),  any member of the largest class of the phylum  , which is itself the largest of the   phyla. Insects have   bodies, jointed legs, and external skeletons ( ). Insects are distinguished from other arthropods by their body, which is divided into three major regions: (1) the  , which bears the  , eyes, and a pair of antennae, (2) the three-segmented  , which usually has three pairs of legs (hence “Hexapoda”) in adults and usually one or two pairs of wings, and (3) the many-segmented  , which contains the digestive, excretory, and reproductive organs. In a popular sense, “insect” usually refers to familiar pests or disease carriers, such as  ,  , clothes moths,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and hornets, or to   groups, such as  ,  , and beetles. Many insects, however, are   from a   viewpoint; they pollinate plants, produce useful substances, control   insects, act as scavengers, and serve as food for other animals (   ). Furthermore, insects are valuable objects of study in elucidating many aspects of   and  . Much of the scientific knowledge of   has been gained from   experiments and of population biology from flour beetle studies. Insects are often used in investigations of hormonal action, nerve and sense organ function, and many other physiological processes. Insects are also used as environmental quality indicators to assess water quality and soil contamination and are the basis of many studies of  . In numbers of   and individuals and in adaptability and wide distribution, insects are perhaps the most eminently successful group of all animals. They dominate the present-day land fauna with about 1 million described species. This represents about three-fourths of all described animal species. Entomologists estimate the actual number of living insect species could be as high as 5 million to 10 million. The orders that contain the greatest numbers of species are   ( ),   (butterflies and  ),   ( , bees,  ), and   (true flies). The majority of insects are small, usually less than 6 mm (0.2 inch) long, although the range in size is wide. Some of the   and parasitic wasps are almost microscopic, while some tropical forms such as the hercules beetles, African goliath beetles, certain Australian stick insects, and the wingspan of the hercules   can be as large as 27 cm (10.6 inches). In many species the difference in body structure between the sexes is pronounced, and knowledge of one sex may give few clues to the appearance of the other sex. In some, such as the twisted-wing insects ( ), the female is a mere inactive bag of eggs, and the winged male is one of the most active insects known. Modes of reproduction are quite  , and reproductive capacity is generally high. Some insects, such as the  , feed only in the immature or larval stage and go without food during an extremely short   life. Among social insects, queen termites may live for up to 50 years, whereas some adult mayflies live less than two hours. Some insects advertise their presence to the other sex by flashing lights, and many imitate other insects in colour and form and thus avoid or minimize attack by predators that feed by day and find their   visually, as do birds, lizards, and other insects. Behaviour is diverse, from the almost   parasitic forms, whose   lie in the nutrient bloodstreams of their hosts and feed by absorption, to   that pursue victims in the air,   that outrun prey on land, and predaceous water beetles that outswim prey in water. In some cases the adult insects make elaborate preparations for the young, in others the mother alone defends or feeds her young, and in still others the young are supported by complex insect societies. Some colonies of social insects, such as tropical   and  , may reach populations of millions of inhabitants.

Some philosophers regarded it as a kind of substance, or “mental stuff,” quite different from the material substance of the physical world. Others   of it as an attribute characterized by   and voluntary movement, which separated animals and men from lower forms of life and also described the difference between the normal waking state of animals and men and their condition when asleep, in a  , or under   (the latter condition was described as unconsciousness). Other descriptions included an analysis of   as a form of relationship or act of the   toward objects in nature, and a view that consciousness was a continuous field or stream of essentially mental “sense data,” roughly similar to the “ideas” of earlier   philosophers. The method employed by most early writers in observing consciousness was  —looking within one’s own mind to discover the laws of its operation. The limitations of the method became apparent when it was found that because of differing preconceptions, trained observers in the laboratory often could not agree on fundamental observations. The failure of introspection to reveal consistent laws led to the rejection of all mental states as proper subjects of scientific study. In behaviourist  , derived primarily from work of the American psychologist   in the early 1900s, the   of consciousness was irrelevant to the objective investigation of   and was doctrinally ignored in research. Neobehaviourists, however, adopted a more liberal posture toward mentalistic states such as consciousness. That consciousness depends on the function of the brain has been known from ancient times. Although detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms of consciousness has not been achieved, correlations between states of consciousness and functions of the brain are possible. Levels of consciousness in terms of levels of alertness or responsiveness are correlated with patterns of electrical activity of the brain ( ) recorded by an electroencephalograph. During wide-awake consciousness the pattern of brain waves consists of rapid irregular waves of low   or voltage. In contrast, during  , when consciousness can be said to be minimal, the brain waves are much slower and of greater amplitude, often coming in periodic bursts of slow waxing and waning amplitude. Both behavioral levels of consciousness and the correlated patterns of electrical activity are related to the function of a part of the brainstem called the  . Electrical stimulation of the ascending reticular systems arouses a sleeping cat to alert consciousness and simultaneously activates its brain waves to the waking pattern. It was once supposed that the neurophysiological mechanisms subserving consciousness and the higher mental processes must reside in the  . It is more likely, however, that the cortex serves the more specialized functions of   patterns of sensory experience and organizing motor patterns and that the ascending reticular system represents the neural structures most critically related to consciousness. The brainstem reticular formation should not, however, be called the seat of consciousness. It represents an integrative focus, functioning through its widespread interconnections with the cortex and other regions of the brain.    ;  .

The shock may range from an unpleasant but harmless jolt of static  , received after one has walked over a thick carpet on a dry day, to a lethal   from a power line. The great majority of deaths occur from   at house-current frequencies of 60   (cycles per second) in   and 50 hertz in Europe. Most of the deaths occur from contact with   at less than 500 volts. That is not to say that high voltages are less dangerous, but they are generally present only on apparatus and supply lines operated by utility companies, which attempt to ensure that only trained and authorized persons have access to them. The effects of electric shock on the   depend on the current that flows—the amperage—rather than on the force of the current, or voltage. The   of the human body is variable and may in fact alter considerably during the passage of an electric shock. Therefore, except in broad terms, applied voltage is not a  . This leads to difficulties in the investigation of accidents, for the electrical engineer is often able to state only the voltage applied, but the physician thinks in terms of the current that flowed. Another important consideration is the path that the current takes through the body. Looked at as an electrical conductor, the body behaves as a solution of   in a leathery container. The greatest current density therefore occurs along the axis joining the two points of contact. As the distance perpendicular to the line of current flow increases, the density of current rapidly falls off. Thus, the   most likely to be affected are those that lie close to the direct path of the current. As the great majority of electrical fatalities are due to currents passing between an arm (usually the right) and the legs, the current passes through the chest and affects the organs within it. Except in those extremely unusual accidents in which the head makes one of the points of contact, the   does not lie on or near the pathway of the current.

It is generally believed that ventricular fibrillation is the most common cause of death in electric shock.  (CPR) is the best emergency first-aid   for victims of electrical shock. It is a highly effective technique when applied by a well-trained person and can, in many cases, provide adequate short-term life support until more sophisticated treatment is available. Although the great majority of victims of electric shock, excluding those who have been burned, either die or recover completely, a very small number suffer from aftereffects, which may be temporary but are sometimes permanent. These may include   of the eye, a form of   (attacks of pain beneath the breastbone), or various disorders of the  .

Content: Biodiversity, also called biological diversity, is the variety of life found in a place on Earth or, often, the total variety of life on Earth. A common measure of this variety, called species richness, is the count of species in an area. Biodiversity also encompasses the genetic variety within each species and the variety of ecosystems that species create. Examining counts of species is the most common method used to compare the biodiversity of various places. A second way to weigh species biodiversity is to recognize the unique biodiversity of those habitats that contain few but unusual species, such as volcanoes, thermal vents, and hot springs. In practice, biodiversity is weighted differently for different species. The pace of decline and extinctions in biodiversity has risen dramatically over the last century, as the effects of climate change increased and human activities such as agriculture, fishing, and hunting continued to encroach into more remote natural areas all over the world. The United Nations named 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity. It was a yearlong celebration intended to raise public awareness about the importance of biodiversity and the need to reinforce conservation efforts. A 2019 report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services noted that up to one million plant and animal species are facing extinction because of human activity. ,  the variety of life found in a place on Earth or, often, the total variety of life on Earth.

Dogs are one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world. (  are the other.)  is a way for dogs to communicate with other dogs and with humans. Fierce barking or growling often signals that dogs are being territorial, feel threatened, or simply want to be left alone. However, dogs also bark when they are bored and want attention from other dogs or from humans. A dog may sniff other dogs’ rear ends to gather chemical information that helps the sniffer identify them as individuals.  -lined sacs, housed internally on either side of a dog’s anus, produce a scent that contributes to each dog’s unique odour profile. That profile may also indicate   makeup,   status, diet, and emotional state.  Many people have learned that one human year equals roughly seven dog years. However, this is a huge oversimplification. How a dog ages is based largely on its size and breed. Smaller dogs tend to age “slower” than larger dogs. Also, the aging rate of some breeds, such as  , differs from that of other similarly sized breeds. Beginning when dogs are six weeks old, a series of four doses of combined   against  ,  ,  , and   are given two to four weeks apart. Within one year of that series, they receive a booster, which is readministered every three years. At three months old, dogs can receive a   vaccine, which is readministered every year or every three years. Whether cities should enact breed-specific legislation (BSL, or "pit bill bans") for dogs is widely debated. Some see BSL as a humane way of making communities safer by discouraging dog fighting and the breeding of dangerous dogs. Others argue there is no evidence that BSL makes communities safer and that other legislation would be more effective than expensive and controversial BSL laws. For more on the debate on pit bull bans, visit  . ,  ( ),  domestic   of the family   (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the   ( ) and is related to   and  . The dog is one of the two most   and most popular domestic animals in the world (the   is the other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a   companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend. The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role in creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most   form of  , dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts and created new breeds as need or desire arose. Dogs are regarded differently in different parts of the world. Characteristics of loyalty, friendship, protectiveness, and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the   and Europe the care and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business. Western civilization has given the relationship between human and dog great importance, but, in some of the developing nations and in many areas of Asia, dogs are not held in the same esteem. In some areas of the world, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden or even for food, whereas in the United States and Europe dogs are protected and admired. In   during the days of the pharaohs, dogs were considered to be sacred. Paleontologists and archaeologists have determined that about 60 million years ago a small mammal, rather like a  , lived in the environs of what are now parts of Asia. It is called  , the   that became the ancestor of the animals known today as canids: dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes.   did not leave direct descendants, but doglike canids evolved from it. By about 30 to 40 million years ago   had evolved into the first true dog—namely,  . This was a medium-size  , longer than it was tall, with a long tail and a fairly brushy coat. Over the millennia   gave rise to two branches, one in Africa and the other in  . The Eurasian branch was called   and is the progenitor of wolves, dogs, and foxes. Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended directly from wolves ( ) and that the now-extinct wolf lineages that produced dogs branched off from the line that produced modern living wolves sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago. The timing and location of dog   is a matter of debate. There is strong genetic evidence, however, that the first domestication events occurred somewhere in northern Eurasia between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago. In this region wolves likely   their own domestication by trailing nomadic people in northern Eurasia and consuming the remains of game animals that hunters left behind. Most studies agree that domestication was not a single discrete event. It was a process that unfolded over thousands of years—likely involving dog populations that appeared in different parts of Eurasia at different times, with dogs and wild wolves continuing to interbreed with one another and with early dog populations being replaced by later ones. Some genetic studies have documented evidence of early domestication events in specific regions. One study   that wolves were domesticated 16,300 years ago to serve as livestock in  , whereas another reports that early dogs dating from about 12,000 to 14,000 years ago came from a small strain of   that inhabited  . Genetic evidence also reveals that dogs did not accompany the first humans to the New World more than 15,000 years ago, suggesting instead that dogs came to the Americas only some 10,000 years ago. One study even suggested that some dogs have descended not from the   but rather from the  . These dogs, found in  , might have given rise to some of the present native African breeds. No matter what their origins, all canids have certain common  . They are mammals that   live young. The females have mammary glands, and they suckle their offspring. The early breeds had erect ears and pointed or wedge-shaped muzzles, similar to the northern breeds common today. Most of the carnivores have similar dental structures, which is one way paleontologists have been able to identify them. They develop two sets of teeth, deciduous (“baby”) teeth and permanent teeth. Canids walk on their toes, in contrast to an animal like the bear, which is flat-footed and walks on its heels. Dogs, like most mammals, have body hair and are homeothermic—that is to say, they have an internal thermostat that permits them to maintain their body temperature at a constant level despite the outside temperature. Fossil remains suggest that five distinct types of dogs existed by the beginning of the   (about 4500  ). They were the mastiffs, wolf-type dogs, sight hounds (such as the Saluki or greyhound), pointing dogs, and herding dogs.

Aphids can be serious plant pests and may stunt plant growth, produce plant galls, transmit   diseases, and cause the deformation of leaves, buds, and flowers. The life cycle of the aphid is complicated. Wingless females, called stem mothers, reproduce without fertilization (i.e., by  ) throughout the summer. These stem mothers are unique in that they produce living young (viviparity) as opposed to eggs, as occurs in most other insects. Eventually the plant containing the stem mother and her offspring becomes overcrowded. When this occurs, some offspring develop into adults with two pairs of large membranous wings. These winged adults fly to new plants. In late summer both males and females are produced. After they mate, the female lays eggs that survive the winter. In warm climates there may be no need for an overwintering egg stage, and   generations occur. The white woolly-ball appearance of many aphids is the result of wax-gland secretion. Aphids are often controlled by natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, aphidlions, and lacewings. However, when economically or aesthetically damaging numbers are present, they can be controlled by insecticidal soaps, horticultural oils, and other traditional insecticides.  may guard and care for aphids in return for the honeydew (a sweet excretory product) they produce. Ants protect aphids from weather and natural enemies and transfer them from wilted to healthy plants. In this way the ants ensure their source of honeydew, which they use as food. Ants obtain honeydew by stroking, or “milking,” the aphids. Common types of aphids include the following: More than 4,000 species of aphids have been described, some 250 of which are pests of crops and ornamental plants. The life history,  , and agricultural significance of select species are described in the following paragraphs. The   ( ) is yellow-green with dark head and legs. It overwinters as a black egg on its only host, the apple tree. It produces honeydew that supports growth of a  . The  cabbage aphid ( ) is small and gray-green with a powdery, waxy covering. It is found in clusters on the underside of leaves of cabbage, cauliflower,  , and radishes. It overwinters as black eggs in northern regions but has no sexual stage in southern regions. When necessary, it can be controlled with the use of insecticides. The  cooley spruce gall adelgid ( ) causes formation of conelike   about 7 cm (3 inches) long on the tips of   twigs. In midsummer when the   open, adults migrate to Douglas firs to lay eggs. However, the life cycle may proceed on either spruce or  . Control is by spraying with  , removing galls before aphids emerge, and planting spruce and Douglas fir apart from each other. The  corn root aphid ( ) is a serious pest dependent on the cornfield  . During the winter, the ants store aphid eggs in their nests and in the spring carry the newly hatched aphids to weed roots, transferring them to corn roots when possible. The aphid stunts the growth of corn and causes plants to turn yellow and wilt. Corn root aphids also infest other grasses. The  eastern spruce gall adelgid ( ) produces pineapple-shaped galls 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4 to 1 inch) long composed of many cells, each containing about 12 aphid nymphs. The galls open in midsummer, releasing mature aphids that infect the same or another spruce. New galls are green with red or purple lines, whereas old galls are brown. Infested branches often die, but individual trees vary in susceptibility. The eastern spruce   adelgid is best controlled by spraying. The  greenbug ( ) is one of the most destructive pests of wheat, oats, and other small grains. It appears as patches of yellow on the plant and may wipe out an entire field. Pale green adults have a dark green stripe down the back. Each female produces between 50 and 60 young per generation, and there are about 20 generations annually. It is controlled by   and insecticides. The  green peach aphid ( ), also called the spinach aphid, is pale yellow-green with three dark lines on the back. The life cycle involves two hosts. The female reproduces parthenogenetically during summer and produces sexual males and females in autumn. It is a serious pest, transmitting many plant mosaic diseases. The melon, or cotton, aphid ( ) is green to black. In warm climates live young are produced all year, while in cooler areas there is an egg stage. Among the dozens of possible hosts are melon, cotton, and cucumber. It is usually controlled by naturally occurring parasites and predators. The   ( ) has two colour  , pale green and pinkish red. It overwinters on clover and alfalfa, migrating to peas in spring. The yellow bean mosaic   it transmits is often responsible for killing pea plants. Each female produces 50 to 100 young in each of 7 to 20 generations a year. It is controlled by insecticides and weather conditions. It is also susceptible to natural predators such as ladybugs and to parasites such as the acarid  . The pea aphid’s colour, which is determined by variations in genes that produce   pigments, may help it evade predators and parasites. Its ability to produce carotenoids is the result of a process known as  , in which the pea aphid   carotenoid genes from   tens of millions of years ago. Carotenoid production has been linked to energy (ATP; adenosine triphosphate) production in pea aphids. The  potato aphid ( ) begins as black eggs on rose plants, which hatch into pink and green young that feed on rosebuds and leaves. In early spring they migrate to potatoes, which are the summer host. One generation occurs every two to three weeks. It is the carrier of tomato and   mosaic virus diseases that kill vines and blossoms. The   ( ) is large and green with black appendages and pink markings. It is common on its only host, the   rose. Natural predators are ladybird   and aphidlions (lacewing larvae). The  rosy apple aphid ( ) deforms fruit, producing “aphis apples.” Its feeding activity causes leaves to curl about it, providing some protection from insecticide sprays. The life cycle involves plantain plants as alternate hosts from which the aphid returns to the apple tree to deposit eggs in the fall. It also attacks pear, hawthorn, and mountain ash. It is often controlled by natural enemies, chiefly syrphid flies, lady beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. However, at times insecticides may be necessary. The  woolly apple aphid ( ) lives on roots and may stunt or kill apple trees. White cottony masses enclose the young aphids. It is controlled by parasites.   .

Even though termites are not closely related to ants, they are sometimes referred to as white ants. Phylogenetic studies have shown that the closest relative to the termite is the cockroach; for this reason termites are sometimes placed in the order Dictyoptera, which also contains the mantids. Termites, which number about 2,750  , are distributed widely, reaching their greatest   in numbers and species in tropical rainforests around the world (   ). In   termites are found as far north as Vancouver,   ( ), on the Pacific coast, and Maine and eastern Canada ( ) on the Atlantic coast. In   the northern limit of natural distribution is reached by   on the Atlantic coast of France, although an introduced species,  , occurs as far north as Hamburg, Germany. The known European species of termites have a predominantly Mediterranean distribution and do not occur naturally in Great Britain, Scandinavia,  , Germany, or northern Russia. In the Far East   ranges as far north as  , Peking, and northern Japan. Termites occur also in the Cape region of  ,  , Tasmania, and  . In addition to naturally occurring termites, many species have been inadvertently transported by humans from their native habitats to new parts of the world. Termites, particularly   and  , have been accidentally transported in   articles such as shipping crates, boat timbers, lumber, and furniture. Because dry-wood termites (  species) live in small colonies in wood and   long periods of dryness, they can survive in seasoned wood and furniture and can easily be   over long distances. Members of the family Rhinotermitidae ( ) require access to moisture and cannot survive prolonged dry periods.  , widely distributed in Japan, Taiwan, and South China, has been introduced into   (Ceylon), the Pacific islands, South Africa,  , Hawaii, California, and the southern  .   is unusual for the family in that it can survive without direct soil contact as long as a moisture source is present. In the United States the species has been found to have well-established colonies in the upper reaches of buildings, using small leaks in the roof as a moisture source. A termite native to the United States,  , was found in the hothouses of the Royal Palace in Schönbrunn, in Vienna, and the species was reported and described in that location before it was discovered in the United States. The termites presumably had been shipped from North America in wooden containers of decorative potted plants. Termites are important in two ways. They are destructive when they feed upon, and often destroy, wooden structures or vegetable matter valuable to humans. Introduced species, because they are not so well equipped as native species to adapt to changes in their new  , tend to seek shelter in protected, man-made environments such as buildings and thus are likely to become the most serious  , causing significant damage to houses and wooden furnishings. Some termites feed on living plant materials and can become serious crop pests. Termites are also extremely   in that they help to convert plant   into substances that can be recycled into the ecosystem to support new growth. Although only about 10 percent of the 2,750 known termite species have been reported as pests, many of these cause severe and extremely costly damage. For effective control, it is essential to determine whether the pest is a subterranean or a wood-dwelling species, as treatment methods differ.  are dependent on contact with soil moisture and normally reach the wood in man-made structures through the foundations. The most common traditional control used around a structure is to flood a shallow trench with an insecticide and cover it with soil. Insecticides also are useful around cracks and crevices in foundations. A recent development has been to establish permanent monitoring stations around the perimeter of a foundation. When termites are discovered in a station, the wooden “bait” is replaced with a cellulose material containing a chitin inhibitor that is   by the foraging workers and returned to the colony and fed to others. This material disrupts normal formation of the exoskeleton (cuticle) of   workers (the only caste capable of molting), resulting in death of the workers and, eventually, the rest of the colony. Construction and design practices that can prevent the initial entry of subterranean termites into a structure include the use of pressure-treated wood, treated concrete foundation blocks, and   foundations that extend at least 15.2 cm (6 inches) above the ground and have no cracks or contact with any outside wood. Removal of scrap lumber from building sites will also reduce the termite population.  nest in the wood on which they feed and do not invade a structure from the soil. Because their colonies are within the structure, they are difficult to control. Preventive measures include the use of chemically treated wood in   and the use of paint or other durable finish to seal cracks in wood surfaces. Fumigation is the most effective method for eliminating a dry-wood termite infestation. Another method is to place insecticide into small holes drilled into galleries of infested wood.

Genetics forms one of the central pillars of   and overlaps with many other areas, such as agriculture,  , and  . Since the dawn of civilization, humankind has recognized the influence of heredity and applied its principles to the improvement of   crops and domestic animals. A Babylonian tablet more than 6,000 years old, for example, shows  s of horses and indicates possible inherited characteristics. Other old carvings show cross-  of   trees. Most of the mechanisms of heredity, however, remained a mystery until the 19th century, when genetics as a systematic   began. Genetics arose out of the identification of genes, the fundamental units responsible for heredity. Genetics may be defined as the study of  s at all levels, including the ways in which they act in the   and the ways in which they are transmitted from parents to offspring. Modern genetics focuses on the chemical substance that genes are made of, called deoxyribonucleic acid, or  , and the ways in which it affects the chemical reactions that   the living processes within the cell. Gene action depends on interaction with the  . Green  s, for example, have genes containing the information necessary to synthesize the photosynthetic pigment   that gives them their green colour. Chlorophyll is synthesized in an environment containing light because the gene for chlorophyll is expressed only when it interacts with light. If a plant is placed in a dark environment, chlorophyll synthesis stops because the gene is no longer expressed. Genetics as a scientific   stemmed from the work of   in the middle of the 19th century. Mendel suspected that traits were inherited as discrete units, and, although he knew nothing of the physical or chemical nature of genes at the time, his units became the basis for the development of the present understanding of heredity. All present research in genetics can be traced back to Mendel’s discovery of the laws governing the inheritance of traits. The word   was introduced in 1905 by English biologist  , who was one of the discoverers of Mendel’s work and who became a champion of Mendel’s principles of inheritance. Although scientific evidence for patterns of genetic inheritance did not appear until Mendel’s work, history shows that humankind must have been interested in heredity long before the dawn of civilization. Curiosity must first have been based on   family resemblances, such as similarity in body structure, voice, gait, and gestures. Such notions were instrumental in the establishment of family and royal  . Early   were interested in the qualities of the animals that they herded and domesticated and, undoubtedly, bred selectively. The first human settlements that practiced farming appear to have selected crop plants with favourable qualities. Ancient tomb paintings show racehorse breeding pedigrees containing clear depictions of the inheritance of several distinct physical traits in the horses. Despite this interest, the first recorded speculations on heredity did not exist until the time of the ancient Greeks; some aspects of their ideas are still considered relevant today.  (  460–  375  ), known as the father of medicine, believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics, and, to account for this, he devised the   known as  . He postulated that all organs of the body of a parent gave off invisible “seeds,” which were like miniaturized building components and were transmitted during  , reassembling themselves in the mother’s womb to form a baby.  (384–322  ) emphasized the importance of   in heredity. He thought that the blood supplied generative material for building all parts of the adult body, and he reasoned that blood was the basis for passing on this generative power to the next generation. In fact, he believed that the male’s semen was purified blood and that a woman’s menstrual blood was her equivalent of semen. These male and female contributions united in the womb to produce a baby. The blood contained some type of hereditary essences, but he believed that the baby would develop under the influence of these essences, rather than being built from the essences themselves. Aristotle’s ideas about the role of blood in procreation were probably the origin of the still prevalent notion that somehow the blood is involved in heredity. Today people still speak of certain traits as being “in the blood” and of “blood lines” and “blood ties.” The Greek model of inheritance, in which a teeming multitude of substances was  , differed from that of the Mendelian model. Mendel’s idea was that distinct differences between individuals are determined by differences in single yet powerful hereditary factors. These single hereditary factors were identified as genes. Copies of genes are transmitted through   and egg and guide the development of the offspring. Genes are also responsible for reproducing the distinct features of both parents that are visible in their children. In the two millennia between the lives of   and  , few new ideas were recorded on the nature of  . In the 17th and 18th centuries the idea of preformation was introduced. Scientists using the newly developed s imagined that they could see miniature   of human beings inside sperm heads. French biologist   invoked the idea of “the inheritance of acquired characters,” not as an explanation for heredity but as a model for  . He lived at a time when the fixity of species was taken for granted, yet he maintained that this fixity was only found in a constant environment. He enunciated the  law of use and disuse, which states that when certain organs become specially developed as a result of some environmental need, then that state of development is hereditary and can be passed on to progeny. He believed that in this way, over many generations,  s could arise from deerlike animals that had to keep stretching their necks to reach high leaves on trees. British naturalist   originally   the theory of evolution by  . However,  ’s observations during his circumnavigation of the globe aboard the HMS   (1831–36) provided evidence for natural selection and his suggestion that humans and animals shared a common ancestry. Many scientists at the time believed in a hereditary mechanism that was a version of the ancient Greek idea of pangenesis, and Darwin’s ideas did not appear to fit with the theory of heredity that sprang from the experiments of Mendel.

The term   was coined by Australian sociologist Judy Singer to provide an   to language that describes neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism, in a way that focuses on deficits. Singer proposed that, contrary to popular belief at the time, people with autism are not abnormal but have brains that naturally work differently, with different strengths and weaknesses. This idea has inspired a   movement to treat neurodevelopmental conditions such as  ,  , and   (ADHD) as natural and potentially valuable variations in human neurology. Although discussion of neurodiversity is most often concerned with these and other recognized neurodevelopmental conditions, in a broad sense neurodiversity   the wide spectrum of   and neurological development, as no two people experience the world exactly the same way. The neurodiversity movement is closely tied to the disability rights movement. Neurodiversity usually concerns people with neurodevelopmental conditions that cause some level of impairment (a challenge in performing some activity), sometimes called  . People with these conditions are referred to as  , whereas people without them are referred to as  . Some neurodivergent people may experience significant disability because of their impairments, whereas others may not, and some may perceive themselves as disabled only in relation to a society organized for neurotypical people that does not meet their needs (the social model of disability). The neurodiversity movement and the disability rights movement are aligned in believing that no level of disability diminishes a person’s humanity and that disability should never be stigmatized as a flaw. Neurodivergent people face a variety of challenges, but they also may have   strengths. For example, some research has indicated that people with dyslexia tend to be better at picturing three-dimensional objects and may have brains specialized for exploration of and   to the unknown. Far from being a developmental failure, dyslexia may have been—and may still be—important to humanity’s success. While maintaining that no one’s neurodivergence needs to be justified by a special benefit, the neurodiversity movement seeks to view neurodivergence in a more complete way, rather than focusing solely on impairments. Though   is not a medical term, and the movement often objects to medicalizing natural human differences, its principles have been widely influential on the clinical treatment of neurodivergent individuals. The neurodiversity movement is most strongly linked with   and the autism spectrum. Neurodivergencies on the autism spectrum generally involve some combination of differences in socialization, communication, sensory processing, and behaviour. Many people with autism have   that require treatment, but people on the autism spectrum frequently report that treatment for autism is too focused on promoting neurotypical behaviour and socialization. The neurodiversity movement’s view that the neurological differences and behaviours linked to autism are differences rather than problems in and of themselves suggests focusing treatment on those traits of autism that cause the individual distress, rather than assuming that any difference from “normal” behaviour is undesirable. As with many other forms of neurodiversity, there is evidence that autism is linked to high skill in certain areas, such as memorization, and that the genetic traits underlying autism have been advantageous in  .  (ADHD) is a condition featuring patterns of inattention and hyperactivity. ADHD has been the subject of considerable controversy. Its prevalence and the culturally determined nature of the   have led many people to suggest that ADHD is not a disorder or deficiency but simply a difference in personality. Some neurodiversity activists have promoted an alternative   of traditional ADHD behaviours, called variable attention stimulus trait (VAST). This alternative conception recognizes that people diagnosed with ADHD often have an abundance of attention, rather than a deficit, but experience difficulties in how they focus that attention. There is evidence that people with ADHD tend to experience some benefits of the condition, including creativity, spontaneity, and the ability to hyperfocus on certain tasks. Other neurodivergencies include specific neurodevelopmental learning difficulties, such as dyslexia (difficulty learning to read and spell), dyscalculia (difficulty understanding information communicated in numbers and mathematics), and dysgraphia (difficulty writing). Dyspraxia, sometimes called developmental coordination disorder (DCD), is a neurodevelopmental difficulty with movement and coordination. Many other conditions are sometimes included under the neurodivergent umbrella.

The larva lives in a vertical burrow, which is sometimes as much as 0.67 metre (2 feet) deep. It waits at the top of the burrow for prey, which usually consists of insects and spiders. It lunges out and grasps the prey with sicklelike mandibles (jaws). A pair of hooks on the abdomen anchor the larva, so that it cannot be pulled out of its burrow by the struggling victim. The prey is then dragged to the bottom of the burrow and eaten. The slender, long-legged adults are about 10 to 20 mm (  to   inch) long and have bulging eyes that provide a   sense of vision. Many are iridescent blue, green, orange, or scarlet in colour. The wide range of colours is created both by pigments laid down in the exoskeleton and refractory colours created by surface characteristics of the exoskeleton. They are rapid runners and fliers that can easily capture a variety of prey. When handled, tiger beetles can inflict a painful bite with their long mandibles. The wing covers (elytra) of many species of  , a common genus, have scroll-like marks.

Some philosophers regarded it as a kind of substance, or “mental stuff,” quite different from the material substance of the physical world. Others   of it as an attribute characterized by   and voluntary movement, which separated animals and men from lower forms of life and also described the difference between the normal waking state of animals and men and their condition when asleep, in a  , or under   (the latter condition was described as unconsciousness). Other descriptions included an analysis of   as a form of relationship or act of the   toward objects in nature, and a view that consciousness was a continuous field or stream of essentially mental “sense data,” roughly similar to the “ideas” of earlier   philosophers. The method employed by most early writers in observing consciousness was  —looking within one’s own mind to discover the laws of its operation. The limitations of the method became apparent when it was found that because of differing preconceptions, trained observers in the laboratory often could not agree on fundamental observations. The failure of introspection to reveal consistent laws led to the rejection of all mental states as proper subjects of scientific study. In behaviourist  , derived primarily from work of the American psychologist   in the early 1900s, the   of consciousness was irrelevant to the objective investigation of   and was doctrinally ignored in research. Neobehaviourists, however, adopted a more liberal posture toward mentalistic states such as consciousness. That consciousness depends on the function of the brain has been known from ancient times. Although detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms of consciousness has not been achieved, correlations between states of consciousness and functions of the brain are possible. Levels of consciousness in terms of levels of alertness or responsiveness are correlated with patterns of electrical activity of the brain ( ) recorded by an electroencephalograph. During wide-awake consciousness the pattern of brain waves consists of rapid irregular waves of low   or voltage. In contrast, during  , when consciousness can be said to be minimal, the brain waves are much slower and of greater amplitude, often coming in periodic bursts of slow waxing and waning amplitude. Both behavioral levels of consciousness and the correlated patterns of electrical activity are related to the function of a part of the brainstem called the  . Electrical stimulation of the ascending reticular systems arouses a sleeping cat to alert consciousness and simultaneously activates its brain waves to the waking pattern. It was once supposed that the neurophysiological mechanisms subserving consciousness and the higher mental processes must reside in the  . It is more likely, however, that the cortex serves the more specialized functions of   patterns of sensory experience and organizing motor patterns and that the ascending reticular system represents the neural structures most critically related to consciousness. The brainstem reticular formation should not, however, be called the seat of consciousness. It represents an integrative focus, functioning through its widespread interconnections with the cortex and other regions of the brain.    ;  .

Some of the most pressing problems in human affairs—expanding populations, food scarcities,   including  , extinctions of   and    , and all the attendant sociological and political problems—are to a great degree ecological. The word   was coined by the German zoologist  , who applied the term   to the “relation of the animal both to its organic as well as its inorganic environment.” The word comes from the Greek  , meaning “household,” “home,” or “place to live.” Thus, ecology deals with the organism and its environment. The concept of   includes both other organisms and physical surroundings. It involves relationships between individuals within a population and between individuals of different populations. These interactions between individuals, between populations, and between organisms and their environment form ecological systems, or  s. Ecology has been defined variously as “the study of the interrelationships of organisms with their environment and each other,” as “the economy of nature,” and as “the   of ecosystems.” Ecology had no firm beginnings. It evolved from the natural history of the ancient Greeks, particularly  , a friend and associate of  . Theophrastus first described the interrelationships between organisms and between organisms and their nonliving environment. Later foundations for modern ecology were laid in the early work of plant and animal physiologists. In the early and mid-1900s two groups of botanists, one in   and the other in the  , studied plant   from two different points of view. The European botanists concerned themselves with the study of the  , structure, and distribution of plant communities. The American botanists studied the   of plant communities, or succession (   ). Both plant and animal ecology developed separately until American biologists emphasized the interrelation of both plant and animal communities as a biotic whole. During the same period, interest in     developed. The study of population dynamics received special   in the early 19th century, after the English economist   called attention to the conflict between expanding populations and the capability of   to supply food. In the 1920s the American zoologist  , the American chemist and statistician Alfred J. Lotka, and the Italian mathematician   developed mathematical foundations for the study of populations, and these studies led to experiments on the interaction of predators and  , competitive relationships between species, and the regulation of populations. Investigations of the influence of behaviour on populations were stimulated by the recognition in 1920 of territoriality in nesting birds.   of instinctive and   were developed by the Austrian zoologist   and the Dutch-born British zoologist  , and the role of social behaviour in the regulation of populations was explored by the British zoologist Vero Wynne-Edwards. (   .) While some ecologists were studying the dynamics of communities and populations, others were concerned with energy budgets. In 1920  August Thienemann, a German freshwater biologist, introduced the concept of trophic, or feeding, levels (   ), by which the energy of food is transferred through a series of organisms, from green plants (the producers) up to several levels of animals (the consumers). An English animal ecologist,   (1927), further developed this approach with the   of ecological  s and pyramids of numbers. In the 1930s, American freshwater biologists Edward Birge and Chancey Juday, in measuring the energy budgets of lakes, developed the idea of  , the rate at which food energy is generated, or fixed, by  . In 1942 Raymond L. Lindeman of the United States developed the trophic-dynamic concept of ecology, which details the flow of energy through the ecosystem. Quantified   studies of   through ecosystems were further developed by the brothers Eugene Odum and Howard Odum of the United States; similar early work on the cycling of   was done by J.D. Ovington of England and Australia. (   ;   and  .) The study of both energy flow and nutrient cycling was   by the development of new materials and techniques—radioisotope tracers, microcalorimetry,  , and applied mathematics—that enabled ecologists to label, track, and measure the movement of particular nutrients and energy through ecosystems. These modern methods (   ) encouraged a new stage in the development of ecology— , which is concerned with the structure and function of ecosystems.

It was accidentally introduced into the   from   about 1916, probably as   in the soil around imported plants. Japanese beetles are known to feed on more than 200 species of plants, including a wide variety of trees, shrubs, grasses, and nursery plants. They are   insects, often feeding in large groups upon a single tree. A swarm of Japanese beetles can denude a   tree in 15 minutes, leaving nothing but bare branches and the fruit pits. Female beetles burrow from 25 to 100 mm (1 to 4 inches) below the surface of the soil to deposit their eggs, which hatch in about 14 days. The larvae live the entire winter below the surface of the ground in this stage, feeding on the tender roots of plants. During May the larvae transform to prepupa and then to pupa stages, the adult beetles   in June or July. The beetles range from Maine to  , and infestations have been noted in other parts of  . The adult  , about 10 mm (0.4 inch) long, is bright metallic green in colour with coppery-brown wing covers (elytra), five patches of white spots on each side, and two prominent white tufts on top of the exposed tip of the abdomen. Unlike the larva, the adult feeds on the flowers, fruit, and foliage of the plant. Efforts are being made to control the spread of this pest. Poisonous sprays control the adult beetles but differ in the length of their protection against reinfestation. Several of the beetle’s natural enemies—species of parasitic wasps and flies that in Japan were found to prey on the larvae—have been imported into the United States, where some of them have become established.

About 90 percent of all flies occurring in human habitations are houseflies. Once a major nuisance and hazard to   in cities, houseflies are still a problem wherever decomposing organic waste and garbage are allowed to accumulate. The adult housefly is dull gray with dirty-yellowish areas on the abdomen and longitudinal lines on the  . Body size ranges from about 5 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 inch), and the     eyes have approximately 4,000 facets. Because it has sponging or lapping mouthparts, the housefly cannot bite; a near relative, the  , however, does bite. The housefly can walk on vertical window panes or hang upside down on a ceiling probably because of the surface-tension properties of a secretion produced by tiny glandular pads (pulvilli) beneath each claw on the feet. The female deposits more than 100 slender whitish eggs (0.8 to 1 mm long) at a time, producing between about 600 and 1,000 eggs in her life. These eggs hatch in 12 to 24 hours.

Modern principles of other fields— ,  , and  , for example—are   with those of biology in areas such as  , biomedicine, and  . Biology is subdivided into separate branches for convenience of study, though all the subdivisions are interrelated by basic principles. Thus, while it is custom to separate the study of   ( ) from that of   ( ), and the study of the structure of organisms ( ) from that of function ( ), all living things share in common certain biological phenomena—for example, various means of  ,  , and the transmission of genetic material. Biology is often approached on the basis of levels that deal with fundamental units of life. At the level of  , for example, life is regarded as a   of chemical and   transformations that occur among the many chemical   that compose an organism. As a result of the   of increasingly powerful and precise laboratory instruments and techniques, it is possible to understand and define with high precision and accuracy not only the ultimate physiochemical organization (ultrastructure) of the molecules in living matter but also the way living matter reproduces at the molecular level. Especially crucial to those advances was the rise of   in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  is the study of cells—the fundamental units of structure and function in living organisms.   were first observed in the 17th century, when the     was invented. Before that time, the individual organism was studied as a whole in a field known as  organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.   biology deals with groups or populations of organisms that inhabit a given area or region. Included at that level are studies of the roles that specific kinds of plants and animals play in the complex and self-perpetuating interrelationships that exist between the living and the nonliving world, as well as studies of the built-in controls that maintain those relationships naturally. Those broadly based levels— , cells, whole organisms, and populations—may be further subdivided for study, giving rise to specializations such as  ,  , biophysics, biochemistry,  ,  , and  . A field of biology may be especially concerned with the investigation of one kind of living thing—for example, the study of   in  , the study of   in  , or the study of microorganisms in  . The concept of  —that living things maintain a constant internal environment—was first suggested in the 19th century by French physiologist  , who stated that “all the vital mechanisms, varied as they are, have only one object: that of preserving constant the conditions of life.” As originally conceived by Bernard,   applied to the struggle of a single organism to survive. The concept was later extended to include any biological system from the   to the entire  , all the areas of   inhabited by living things. All living organisms, regardless of their uniqueness, have certain biological, chemical, and physical characteristics in common. All, for example, are composed of basic units known as   and of the same chemical substances, which, when analyzed, exhibit noteworthy similarities, even in such   organisms as   and  . Furthermore, since the action of any organism is determined by the manner in which its cells interact and since all cells interact in much the same way, the basic functioning of all organisms is also similar. There is not only unity of basic living substance and functioning but also unity of origin of all living things. According to a theory proposed in 1855 by German pathologist  , “all living cells arise from pre-existing living cells.” That theory appears to be true for all living things at the present time under existing environmental conditions. If, however, life originated on Earth more than once in the past, the fact that all organisms have a sameness of basic structure,  , and function would seem to indicate that only one original type succeeded. A common origin of life would explain why in humans or bacteria—and in all forms of life in between—the same chemical substance, deoxyribonucleic acid ( ), in the form of   accounts for the ability of all living matter to replicate itself exactly and to transmit genetic information from parent to offspring. Furthermore, the mechanisms for that transmittal follow a pattern that is the same in all organisms. Whenever a change in a   (a  ) occurs, there is a change of some kind in the organism that contains the gene. It is this universal phenomenon that gives rise to the differences ( ) in   of organisms from which nature selects for survival those that are best able to   with changing conditions in the  .

When early man hunted animals and foraged for food, he shared the natural resources with other organisms in the  . As human   developed and population rose, people made ever-increasing demands on these resources. One result of changing the   has been a great increase in the number of species that are now recognized as competitors of humans. These competitors are usually referred to as pests. The definition of pest is, of course, subjective. An   would not necessarily consider several leaf-eating   on a plant as pests, whereas a gardener who   the plant might very well do so. And only one  ,  , or   is enough to qualify as a household pest. Natural   have always contained organisms that were economically significant; locusts, for example, have plagued humans throughout history, and grain from   locations has been found infected with   and   diseases. Most species that became pests, however, did so because of environmental modification, occasionally from natural causes but usually from human activities. In order to appreciate some of the methods devised to combat pests, one should consider how advancing   has increased the number of harmful   species. The change from natural vegetation to large areas of single-crop ( )   has three consequences. First, given a more uniform food source, some plant-eating species increase to large populations. Second, the uniform plant cover is easily invaded by attacking pests. Third, the introduction of new crops over large areas results in the transfer of previously harmless insects from scattered native plants to the new and abundant sources of food. Cultural practices such as fertilization,  , and the use of modern harvesting equipment (which often leaves large amounts of plant litter in the field)   still further the ability of pest species to increase rapidly. In addition, the elimination of species that compete with or prey upon pests—an unintended effect in some pest control programs—has also   certain pest problems. Also, the ease with which people and goods can be transported around the world has resulted in the introduction of exotic pests in many places. Pests are found throughout the   kingdom. Microorganisms such as fungi,  , and viruses are here considered with the pests even though they are usually thought of as agents of  . Most animal pests are invertebrates, among them protozoa, flatworms, nematodes, snails, slugs, insects, and mites. Among the vertebrates, rabbits, elk, deer, and many kinds of rodents are sometimes injurious to crops. Insects are also serious pests, especially those involved with the   of disease. Each year millions of lives, particularly in the tropics, are threatened by insect-borne diseases. Malaria and   are transmitted by mosquitoes,   by fleas, typhus by the  ,   by tsetse flies,   by blood-sucking bugs, and leishmaniasis by sandflies. Other diseases may be spread by insects accidentally as a result of their habits. The  , a pest responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of   in  , arrived in the   in the 1990s, probably embedded in shipping materials from eastern Asia. Pest control began to receive attention in the 18th century, and it has become increasingly important since then. As control programs were developed, they tended to fall primarily into two somewhat mutually   categories: chemical and biological. Physical or mechanical methods, including sticky barriers, heat killing (for storage pests), and flooding (for ground pests), were also developed. Because of their limited utility and short-term effectiveness, they have been superseded largely by chemical and biological methods. The chemical, or  , approach probably began with the use of poisonous plant  —ground tobacco was used in France to kill aphids about 1763. Other natural products such as nicotine, rotenone, petroleum, kerosene, creosote, and turpentine were used in the 19th century. Inorganic compounds such as Paris green, lime sulfur, Bordeaux mixture,  , and lead arsenate were also introduced in the 1800s. With the appearance of the   organic compounds during  , a dramatic change occurred in pest control. Some organic compounds, such as the dinitrophenols, had been used earlier, but the discovery of the insecticidal properties of   (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) and of BHC ( ) made the concept of pest-free crops possible. Research in the 1930s on plant hormones and related compounds led to the development of the selective   2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), and this became commercially available about the same time as DDT. Following the appearance of these new synthetic organic compounds, a whole new series of pesticides—insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and plant growth regulators—was introduced. Although the ancient Chinese used predacious ants to control foliage-feeding insects, the control of pests by biological means appears to have been initiated in the Western world with the importation of the Indian Mynah   into Mauritius in 1762 to control the red locust. Control of bedbugs by predatory agents was recommended in 1776. A number of other projects in   were carried out in the 1800s, but the modern era in this phase of pest control began in 1888 with the importation into California of the vedalia   ( ) to control the   ( ). This beetle, imported from  , saved the citrus-fruit industry. The use of plants resistant to insects was suggested about 1788 as a means of controlling the  , a pest of wheat. The classic example of this approach was the control of phylloxera, aphid-like insects that attacked the root stocks of the European wine grape and almost ruined the European wine industry. The solution lay in grafting the European wine grape onto resistant American stocks. The effort, about 1900, to control the lantana shrub in Hawaii by introducing an insect appears to have been the first attempt to control weeds biologically. The use of microorganisms to destroy insect pests began in the late 1800s and early 1900s. With the appearance of the synthetic organic insecticides, however, emphasis was placed on chemical control, and biological means fell into neglect. The extensive use of powerful chemical agents soon resulted in a number of serious ecological problems. Consequently, current pest control practice minimizes the use of pesticides and combines them with biological methods in an approach called  . The   control of an insect that attacks crops may, for example, involve the   of pest-resistant   varieties; the development of crop   methods that   pest proliferation; the release of organisms that are predators or parasites of the pest species; the placement of traps baited with the pest’s own sex attractants (pheromones); the disruption of the pest’s reproduction by the release of sterilized pests; and, often as a last resort, the application of chemical insecticides. Other important tools of modern pest control or importation and quarantine regulations, which are designed to prevent the introduction of exotic pests.

Strepsipterans are parasitic in planthoppers, leafhoppers, treehoppers, froghoppers, bees, and other insects. Mature females are usually wingless and saclike, whereas the males have large, fanlike hindwings, short, clublike forewings, bulging eyes, and comblike antennae. The bristly and long-legged   larvae are picked up from a flower by bees and transported to a   nest, where they penetrate bee larvae and live as parasites first within the larva and later in the adult bee.

Even though termites are not closely related to ants, they are sometimes referred to as white ants. Phylogenetic studies have shown that the closest relative to the termite is the cockroach; for this reason termites are sometimes placed in the order Dictyoptera, which also contains the mantids. Termites, which number about 2,750  , are distributed widely, reaching their greatest   in numbers and species in tropical rainforests around the world (   ). In   termites are found as far north as Vancouver,   ( ), on the Pacific coast, and Maine and eastern Canada ( ) on the Atlantic coast. In   the northern limit of natural distribution is reached by   on the Atlantic coast of France, although an introduced species,  , occurs as far north as Hamburg, Germany. The known European species of termites have a predominantly Mediterranean distribution and do not occur naturally in Great Britain, Scandinavia,  , Germany, or northern Russia. In the Far East   ranges as far north as  , Peking, and northern Japan. Termites occur also in the Cape region of  ,  , Tasmania, and  . In addition to naturally occurring termites, many species have been inadvertently transported by humans from their native habitats to new parts of the world. Termites, particularly   and  , have been accidentally transported in   articles such as shipping crates, boat timbers, lumber, and furniture. Because dry-wood termites (  species) live in small colonies in wood and   long periods of dryness, they can survive in seasoned wood and furniture and can easily be   over long distances. Members of the family Rhinotermitidae ( ) require access to moisture and cannot survive prolonged dry periods.  , widely distributed in Japan, Taiwan, and South China, has been introduced into   (Ceylon), the Pacific islands, South Africa,  , Hawaii, California, and the southern  .   is unusual for the family in that it can survive without direct soil contact as long as a moisture source is present. In the United States the species has been found to have well-established colonies in the upper reaches of buildings, using small leaks in the roof as a moisture source. A termite native to the United States,  , was found in the hothouses of the Royal Palace in Schönbrunn, in Vienna, and the species was reported and described in that location before it was discovered in the United States. The termites presumably had been shipped from North America in wooden containers of decorative potted plants. Termites are important in two ways. They are destructive when they feed upon, and often destroy, wooden structures or vegetable matter valuable to humans. Introduced species, because they are not so well equipped as native species to adapt to changes in their new  , tend to seek shelter in protected, man-made environments such as buildings and thus are likely to become the most serious  , causing significant damage to houses and wooden furnishings. Some termites feed on living plant materials and can become serious crop pests. Termites are also extremely   in that they help to convert plant   into substances that can be recycled into the ecosystem to support new growth. Although only about 10 percent of the 2,750 known termite species have been reported as pests, many of these cause severe and extremely costly damage. For effective control, it is essential to determine whether the pest is a subterranean or a wood-dwelling species, as treatment methods differ.  are dependent on contact with soil moisture and normally reach the wood in man-made structures through the foundations. The most common traditional control used around a structure is to flood a shallow trench with an insecticide and cover it with soil. Insecticides also are useful around cracks and crevices in foundations. A recent development has been to establish permanent monitoring stations around the perimeter of a foundation. When termites are discovered in a station, the wooden “bait” is replaced with a cellulose material containing a chitin inhibitor that is   by the foraging workers and returned to the colony and fed to others. This material disrupts normal formation of the exoskeleton (cuticle) of   workers (the only caste capable of molting), resulting in death of the workers and, eventually, the rest of the colony. Construction and design practices that can prevent the initial entry of subterranean termites into a structure include the use of pressure-treated wood, treated concrete foundation blocks, and   foundations that extend at least 15.2 cm (6 inches) above the ground and have no cracks or contact with any outside wood. Removal of scrap lumber from building sites will also reduce the termite population.  nest in the wood on which they feed and do not invade a structure from the soil. Because their colonies are within the structure, they are difficult to control. Preventive measures include the use of chemically treated wood in   and the use of paint or other durable finish to seal cracks in wood surfaces. Fumigation is the most effective method for eliminating a dry-wood termite infestation. Another method is to place insecticide into small holes drilled into galleries of infested wood.

It lunges out and grasps the prey with sicklelike mandibles (jaws). A pair of hooks on the abdomen anchor the larva, so that it cannot be pulled out of its burrow by the struggling victim. The prey is then dragged to the bottom of the burrow and eaten. The slender, long-legged adults are about 10 to 20 mm (  to   inch) long and have bulging eyes that provide a   sense of vision.

Although many winged insects are commonly called flies, the name is strictly applicable only to members of Diptera. One of the largest   orders, it numbers more than 125,000 species that are relatively small, with soft bodies. Although the mouthparts of flies are of the sucking type, individuals show considerable variation in structure. Many flies are of great economic importance. Some bloodsuckers are serious pests of humans and other  . These insects, along with many scavenging flies, are important vectors of disease, whereas others are pests of    . Flies are  , too, functioning as scavengers, predators, or parasites of certain insect pests, as pollinators of plants, and as destroyers of   noxious to humans. Dipterous larvae, often called   or grubs, are found in many habitats (e.g., in any kind of water, in plant tissue and  , beneath   or stones, in decaying plant and   matter, even in pools of crude  ). Adults feed on plant or animal juices or other insects. Diptera fall into three large groups:   (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ),   (e.g.,  ,  ,  ), and   (e.g., flies that breed in vegetable or animal material, both living and dead). Flies range in size from midges of little more than 1 mm to robber flies more than 7 cm long. In general, the more-primitive flies (e.g., mosquitoes, midges, fungus gnats) are fragile insects with delicate wings. The more-advanced flies (e.g.,  ,  ) are generally squat, sturdy, and bristly. They are stronger fliers than midges and gnats. Diptera are   throughout the world: in the tropics, in the subarctic, at  , and high on mountains. They colonize beaches to low-tide level, but few go into deeper water, and only one or two midges are truly marine (e.g.,   in the Pacific). On the other hand, migrating flies have been found far out to sea. The abundance, worldwide distribution, and habits of flies combine to make them a nuisance to humans. Swarms of midges are a common annoyance. Sweat flies and face flies gather around the eyes, nose, and mouth and also suck   and   from wounds and sores. Such flies move constantly from one person to the next and in so doing may at times transfer   organisms. The   ( ) can be dangerous because it moves from person to food, drink, garbage, carrion, or feces.

Other flies pierce the skin of   and feed on their blood. Mosquitoes, black flies, sand flies, biting midges, and horse flies have evolved mandibles and maxillae that are bladelike, piercing stylets. These piercing organs are developed only in females, which use blood protein in egg production. Males do not feed on blood. Other groups of flies have evolved different mechanisms for obtaining blood.  , stable flies or biting houseflies ( ), and certain parasitic flies have developed a hard drill-like labium to replace the soft spongelike one. Both males and females have evolved this labium and both feed on blood. A few flies related to the housefly have a spongy proboscis equipped with small teeth for rasping skin around   and sores to increase the flow of blood and  . Other groups (e.g., robber flies) have developed a piercing   used only against other insects. The transmission of disease that occurs through the use of piercing organs such as a proboscis is considered mechanical transmission. Disease-causing organisms in the blood can be picked up by a   inserting its proboscis into an infected person. The disease may then be transmitted to another person when their skin is pierced by the bloodsucking fly, which injects its   into the wound. Without the anticoagulant properties of this saliva, bloodsucking would be impossible since the tiny hole drilled by the proboscis would clog with clotted blood. If the mouthparts are contaminated with blood that contains microorganisms, they can be injected, along with the saliva, into another person. This is called  direct   of disease and occurs only if the fly, interrupted during a meal, finds a new victim before the microorganisms die. One   that might be spread this way is  , caused by a bacterium found in wild  . Trappers who cut themselves while skinning animals can contract the disease. In   the bacterium is transmitted also by the deer fly ( ), common in wooded trapper country. Surra, a disease of horses and camels in the   and parts of Asia, is caused by the     and is transmitted by horse flies. Trypanosomes, transmitted by  , cause   in humans and   in animals throughout tropical Africa. These trypanosomes must spend part of their   in the insect before they can infect a vertebrate. This is an example of  cyclic disease transmission. The relationship between the   organism and its two hosts, vertebrate and insect, is a result of evolutionary  . However, it is not known whether the trypanosome was originally a fly parasite that spread to humans and other vertebrates or whether it was a human parasite that became adapted to living in a biting fly. An important cyclically transmitted disease is  .  , the causative agent of human malaria, is an acellular protist nourished by   in human blood. Its reproductive cycles cause recurrent bouts of the disease. Occasionally sexual forms occur in the victim’s blood. If this form finds its way into a suitable species of bloodsucking  , another stage of the   begins, preparing the organism to infect another human bitten by the mosquito host. Other diseases known to be cyclically   include  ,  ,  , and other viral diseases. Fly larvae are serious agricultural  ; they feed on young crop plants, retarding growth or killing them. Cultivated crops, because they provide pests with an almost unlimited food supply within a small area, can be devastated by uncontrolled   of a pest.

More than 115,000 species have been described, including  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and lesser-known types. Except in the polar regions, they are abundant in most habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Collectively, the Hymenoptera are most important to humans as pollinators of wild and    , as   of destructive insects, and as makers of  . The Hymenoptera are divided into two suborders:   (mainly sawflies and horntails) and   (wasps, ants, bees, and most parasitic forms). The order includes the best known of the  —ants and some species of bees and wasps. Most species, however, are solitary in habit. Hymenopterans may be parasitic or nonparasitic, carnivorous, phytophagous, or omnivorous. Hymenopterans are chiefly small to medium-sized insects, usually with four membranous wings and a narrow waist that sets off the abdomen from the thorax, or middle region of the body. The mouthparts may be either of the biting type or of the biting-sucking type. In the higher evolutionary forms—bees, for example—mouthparts are modified into a sucking apparatus, although many also retain biting mandibles. The  , or egg-laying organ in the female, is often very long and may be modified for piercing, sawing, or stinging.   is complete; i.e., the insect develops through four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Sex is usually determined by whether or not an egg is fertilized, with fertilized eggs developing into females and unfertilized ones becoming males. Hymenoptera display an array of interesting behavioral characteristics, particularly in social species. The dancelike movements of   communicate information from one individual to another about the location, distance, quantity, and quality of a particular food source. These movements were carefully studied and described by the German entomologist  .  Trophallaxis, or the mutual exchange of food between larvae and adults of bees, ants, and wasps, has been of special interest to hymenopterists.  —the parasitic habit of one species upon another parasitic species—has also attracted attention.  , the development of many individuals (as many as 1,000) from a single egg, is an unusual phenomenon occurring in some members of the families Chalcididae and Proctotrupidae.   (production of young by females that are not fertilized by males) also occurs in some forms. Certain ants are remarkable for their relationship with insects such as aphids and scales that provide   or other sweet fluids. Ants that obtain sweet fluids from the caterpillars of certain species of blue butterflies (Lycaenidae)   by allowing the caterpillars to devour   larvae. The   (  in the  ,   in Africa) has in the nest a division of worker ants known as repletes, which are fed sugary secretions. As a consequence of high food intake, the abdomens of repletes swell into globules up to 1 cm (about 0.4 inch) in diameter. Hymenoptera, even those equipped with a sting, are sought as food by other animals. Skunks, badgers, field mice, shrews, and other animals attack   nests for the insects as well as for the honey. The larvae of the wax month ( ) live in bee nests, where they eat beeswax, thus damaging the nest. The cuckoo bee (Anthophorinae), a close relative of the  , lays its eggs in bumblebee nests, where the larvae are cared for and nourished by bumblebee workers. Hymenopterans range in size from the smallest fairyflies (Mymaridae), which are about 0.21 mm (about 0.008 inch) in length, to the largest of the Pelecinidae, which may exceed 5 cm (about 2 inches) in length. Principal differences in structure within the order include the presence or absence of wings that, when present, consist of two pairs; the presence or absence of a “waist”; modifications of the ovipositor; and   of mouthparts for specific eating habits. Polymorphism, the occurrence of two or more forms of a species, is highly developed in some of the social Hymenoptera. A   colony, for example, contains at least one queen, plus workers and drones, with each form being structurally and physiologically different from the others. Bees and wasps, as the most significant agents for the   of flowers, are found virtually everywhere that flowering plants occur. Social species may live in colonies of as many as 1,000,000 individuals. Ants are most numerous, both in numbers and in species, in tropical and subtropical regions. The number of ant species in arctic or Alpine regions is extremely small. The group appears to be   over great areas north of the  . The honeybee has been valued since pre-Christian times for its honey and beeswax. Beekeeping in modern times has become a lucrative and highly developed enterprise. Royal jelly, produced by honeybee workers, has enjoyed some popularity as a cosmetic, although its beneficial properties in this respect have not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Certain   forms are valuable control agents against insect pests. Notable among these are the parasitic wood wasps that attack wood-boring beetles; braconids that parasitize many   and wood-boring beetles; eulophids that parasitize scale insects; pteromalids that parasitize several crop pests; chalcids and trichogrammatids that parasitize a variety of orchard pests; and tiphiids that parasitize the  . Fig insects (Agaonidae) are valuable as the only pollinators of the Smyrna fig, an important crop in the Western United States. Relatively few Hymenoptera species are serious economic  . Chief among these, however, are the wheatstem   (Cephidae); some seed chalcids that are also pests of wheat; the larch sawfly ( ), which destroyed much of the larch forests in Britain and   late in the 19th century; and the European spruce sawfly ( ), which was once a serious pest in North America. In order to control the European spruce sawfly, parasitic wasps were introduced from Europe. The   ( ), accidentally introduced into the United States from  , feeds on young plants and seeds and is known to attack young mammals.

Content: Biodiversity, also called biological diversity, is the variety of life found in a place on Earth or, often, the total variety of life on Earth. A common measure of this variety, called species richness, is the count of species in an area. Biodiversity also encompasses the genetic variety within each species and the variety of ecosystems that species create. Examining counts of species is the most common method used to compare the biodiversity of various places. A second way to weigh species biodiversity is to recognize the unique biodiversity of those habitats that contain few but unusual species, such as volcanoes, thermal vents, and hot springs. In practice, biodiversity is weighted differently for different species. The pace of decline and extinctions in biodiversity has risen dramatically over the last century, as the effects of climate change increased and human activities such as agriculture, fishing, and hunting continued to encroach into more remote natural areas all over the world. The United Nations named 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity. It was a yearlong celebration intended to raise public awareness about the importance of biodiversity and the need to reinforce conservation efforts.

Aphids can be serious plant pests and may stunt plant growth, produce plant galls, transmit   diseases, and cause the deformation of leaves, buds, and flowers. The life cycle of the aphid is complicated. Wingless females, called stem mothers, reproduce without fertilization (i.e., by  ) throughout the summer. These stem mothers are unique in that they produce living young (viviparity) as opposed to eggs, as occurs in most other insects. Eventually the plant containing the stem mother and her offspring becomes overcrowded. When this occurs, some offspring develop into adults with two pairs of large membranous wings. These winged adults fly to new plants. In late summer both males and females are produced. After they mate, the female lays eggs that survive the winter. In warm climates there may be no need for an overwintering egg stage, and   generations occur. The white woolly-ball appearance of many aphids is the result of wax-gland secretion. Aphids are often controlled by natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, aphidlions, and lacewings. However, when economically or aesthetically damaging numbers are present, they can be controlled by insecticidal soaps, horticultural oils, and other traditional insecticides.  may guard and care for aphids in return for the honeydew (a sweet excretory product) they produce. Ants protect aphids from weather and natural enemies and transfer them from wilted to healthy plants. In this way the ants ensure their source of honeydew, which they use as food. Ants obtain honeydew by stroking, or “milking,” the aphids. Common types of aphids include the following: More than 4,000 species of aphids have been described, some 250 of which are pests of crops and ornamental plants. The life history,  , and agricultural significance of select species are described in the following paragraphs. The   ( ) is yellow-green with dark head and legs. It overwinters as a black egg on its only host, the apple tree. It produces honeydew that supports growth of a  . The  cabbage aphid ( ) is small and gray-green with a powdery, waxy covering. It is found in clusters on the underside of leaves of cabbage, cauliflower,  , and radishes. It overwinters as black eggs in northern regions but has no sexual stage in southern regions. When necessary, it can be controlled with the use of insecticides. The  cooley spruce gall adelgid ( ) causes formation of conelike   about 7 cm (3 inches) long on the tips of   twigs. In midsummer when the   open, adults migrate to Douglas firs to lay eggs. However, the life cycle may proceed on either spruce or  . Control is by spraying with  , removing galls before aphids emerge, and planting spruce and Douglas fir apart from each other. The  corn root aphid ( ) is a serious pest dependent on the cornfield  . During the winter, the ants store aphid eggs in their nests and in the spring carry the newly hatched aphids to weed roots, transferring them to corn roots when possible. The aphid stunts the growth of corn and causes plants to turn yellow and wilt. Corn root aphids also infest other grasses. The  eastern spruce gall adelgid ( ) produces pineapple-shaped galls 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4 to 1 inch) long composed of many cells, each containing about 12 aphid nymphs. The galls open in midsummer, releasing mature aphids that infect the same or another spruce. New galls are green with red or purple lines, whereas old galls are brown. Infested branches often die, but individual trees vary in susceptibility. The eastern spruce   adelgid is best controlled by spraying. The  greenbug ( ) is one of the most destructive pests of wheat, oats, and other small grains. It appears as patches of yellow on the plant and may wipe out an entire field. Pale green adults have a dark green stripe down the back. Each female produces between 50 and 60 young per generation, and there are about 20 generations annually. It is controlled by   and insecticides. The  green peach aphid ( ), also called the spinach aphid, is pale yellow-green with three dark lines on the back. The life cycle involves two hosts. The female reproduces parthenogenetically during summer and produces sexual males and females in autumn. It is a serious pest, transmitting many plant mosaic diseases. The melon, or cotton, aphid ( ) is green to black. In warm climates live young are produced all year, while in cooler areas there is an egg stage. Among the dozens of possible hosts are melon, cotton, and cucumber. It is usually controlled by naturally occurring parasites and predators. The   ( ) has two colour  , pale green and pinkish red. It overwinters on clover and alfalfa, migrating to peas in spring. The yellow bean mosaic   it transmits is often responsible for killing pea plants. Each female produces 50 to 100 young in each of 7 to 20 generations a year. It is controlled by insecticides and weather conditions. It is also susceptible to natural predators such as ladybugs and to parasites such as the acarid  . The pea aphid’s colour, which is determined by variations in genes that produce   pigments, may help it evade predators and parasites. Its ability to produce carotenoids is the result of a process known as  , in which the pea aphid   carotenoid genes from   tens of millions of years ago. Carotenoid production has been linked to energy (ATP; adenosine triphosphate) production in pea aphids. The  potato aphid ( ) begins as black eggs on rose plants, which hatch into pink and green young that feed on rosebuds and leaves. In early spring they migrate to potatoes, which are the summer host. One generation occurs every two to three weeks. It is the carrier of tomato and   mosaic virus diseases that kill vines and blossoms. The   ( ) is large and green with black appendages and pink markings. It is common on its only host, the   rose. Natural predators are ladybird   and aphidlions (lacewing larvae). The  rosy apple aphid ( ) deforms fruit, producing “aphis apples.” Its feeding activity causes leaves to curl about it, providing some protection from insecticide sprays. The life cycle involves plantain plants as alternate hosts from which the aphid returns to the apple tree to deposit eggs in the fall. It also attacks pear, hawthorn, and mountain ash. It is often controlled by natural enemies, chiefly syrphid flies, lady beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. However, at times insecticides may be necessary. The  woolly apple aphid ( ) lives on roots and may stunt or kill apple trees. White cottony masses enclose the young aphids. It is controlled by parasites.   .

It was accidentally introduced into the   from   about 1916, probably as   in the soil around imported plants. Japanese beetles are known to feed on more than 200 species of plants, including a wide variety of trees, shrubs, grasses, and nursery plants. They are   insects, often feeding in large groups upon a single tree. A swarm of Japanese beetles can denude a   tree in 15 minutes, leaving nothing but bare branches and the fruit pits. Female beetles burrow from 25 to 100 mm (1 to 4 inches) below the surface of the soil to deposit their eggs, which hatch in about 14 days. The larvae live the entire winter below the surface of the ground in this stage, feeding on the tender roots of plants. During May the larvae transform to prepupa and then to pupa stages, the adult beetles   in June or July. The beetles range from Maine to  , and infestations have been noted in other parts of  . The adult  , about 10 mm (0.4 inch) long, is bright metallic green in colour with coppery-brown wing covers (elytra), five patches of white spots on each side, and two prominent white tufts on top of the exposed tip of the abdomen. Unlike the larva, the adult feeds on the flowers, fruit, and foliage of the plant. Efforts are being made to control the spread of this pest. Poisonous sprays control the adult beetles but differ in the length of their protection against reinfestation. Several of the beetle’s natural enemies—species of parasitic wasps and flies that in Japan were found to prey on the larvae—have been imported into the United States, where some of them have become established.

Genetics forms one of the central pillars of   and overlaps with many other areas, such as agriculture,  , and  . Since the dawn of civilization, humankind has recognized the influence of heredity and applied its principles to the improvement of   crops and domestic animals. A Babylonian tablet more than 6,000 years old, for example, shows  s of horses and indicates possible inherited characteristics. Other old carvings show cross-  of   trees. Most of the mechanisms of heredity, however, remained a mystery until the 19th century, when genetics as a systematic   began. Genetics arose out of the identification of genes, the fundamental units responsible for heredity. Genetics may be defined as the study of  s at all levels, including the ways in which they act in the   and the ways in which they are transmitted from parents to offspring. Modern genetics focuses on the chemical substance that genes are made of, called deoxyribonucleic acid, or  , and the ways in which it affects the chemical reactions that   the living processes within the cell. Gene action depends on interaction with the  . Green  s, for example, have genes containing the information necessary to synthesize the photosynthetic pigment   that gives them their green colour. Chlorophyll is synthesized in an environment containing light because the gene for chlorophyll is expressed only when it interacts with light. If a plant is placed in a dark environment, chlorophyll synthesis stops because the gene is no longer expressed. Genetics as a scientific   stemmed from the work of   in the middle of the 19th century. Mendel suspected that traits were inherited as discrete units, and, although he knew nothing of the physical or chemical nature of genes at the time, his units became the basis for the development of the present understanding of heredity. All present research in genetics can be traced back to Mendel’s discovery of the laws governing the inheritance of traits. The word   was introduced in 1905 by English biologist  , who was one of the discoverers of Mendel’s work and who became a champion of Mendel’s principles of inheritance. Although scientific evidence for patterns of genetic inheritance did not appear until Mendel’s work, history shows that humankind must have been interested in heredity long before the dawn of civilization. Curiosity must first have been based on   family resemblances, such as similarity in body structure, voice, gait, and gestures. Such notions were instrumental in the establishment of family and royal  . Early   were interested in the qualities of the animals that they herded and domesticated and, undoubtedly, bred selectively. The first human settlements that practiced farming appear to have selected crop plants with favourable qualities. Ancient tomb paintings show racehorse breeding pedigrees containing clear depictions of the inheritance of several distinct physical traits in the horses. Despite this interest, the first recorded speculations on heredity did not exist until the time of the ancient Greeks; some aspects of their ideas are still considered relevant today.  (  460–  375  ), known as the father of medicine, believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics, and, to account for this, he devised the   known as  . He postulated that all organs of the body of a parent gave off invisible “seeds,” which were like miniaturized building components and were transmitted during  , reassembling themselves in the mother’s womb to form a baby.  (384–322  ) emphasized the importance of   in heredity. He thought that the blood supplied generative material for building all parts of the adult body, and he reasoned that blood was the basis for passing on this generative power to the next generation. In fact, he believed that the male’s semen was purified blood and that a woman’s menstrual blood was her equivalent of semen. These male and female contributions united in the womb to produce a baby. The blood contained some type of hereditary essences, but he believed that the baby would develop under the influence of these essences, rather than being built from the essences themselves. Aristotle’s ideas about the role of blood in procreation were probably the origin of the still prevalent notion that somehow the blood is involved in heredity. Today people still speak of certain traits as being “in the blood” and of “blood lines” and “blood ties.” The Greek model of inheritance, in which a teeming multitude of substances was  , differed from that of the Mendelian model. Mendel’s idea was that distinct differences between individuals are determined by differences in single yet powerful hereditary factors. These single hereditary factors were identified as genes. Copies of genes are transmitted through   and egg and guide the development of the offspring. Genes are also responsible for reproducing the distinct features of both parents that are visible in their children. In the two millennia between the lives of   and  , few new ideas were recorded on the nature of  . In the 17th and 18th centuries the idea of preformation was introduced. Scientists using the newly developed s imagined that they could see miniature   of human beings inside sperm heads. French biologist   invoked the idea of “the inheritance of acquired characters,” not as an explanation for heredity but as a model for  . He lived at a time when the fixity of species was taken for granted, yet he maintained that this fixity was only found in a constant environment. He enunciated the  law of use and disuse, which states that when certain organs become specially developed as a result of some environmental need, then that state of development is hereditary and can be passed on to progeny. He believed that in this way, over many generations,  s could arise from deerlike animals that had to keep stretching their necks to reach high leaves on trees. British naturalist   originally   the theory of evolution by  . However,  ’s observations during his circumnavigation of the globe aboard the HMS   (1831–36) provided evidence for natural selection and his suggestion that humans and animals shared a common ancestry. Many scientists at the time believed in a hereditary mechanism that was a version of the ancient Greek idea of pangenesis, and Darwin’s ideas did not appear to fit with the theory of heredity that sprang from the experiments of Mendel.

Ants occur worldwide but are most numerous, both in numbers and in species, in tropical and subtropical regions. Ants are essential members of the   they inhabit, and some even serve as   that have a disproportionately large effect on their ecological  . Some ants are considered pests to humans, and a number are   in areas outside their native ranges.   . Ants range in size from about 2 to 25 mm (about 0.08 to 1 inch). Their color is usually yellow, brown, red, or black. A few genera (e.g.,   of  ) have a metallic luster. Typically, an ant has a large head and a slender, oval   joined to the  , or midsection, by a small waist. In all ants there are either one or two finlike extensions running across the thin waist  . The antennae are always elbowed. There are two sets of jaws: the outer pair is used for carrying objects such as food and for digging, and the inner pair is used for chewing. Some species, such as the debilitating   ( ), have a powerful sting at the tip of the abdomen. Ants are  , and the colony is a family   of which every ant is an   unit. Apart from the community, any one individual cannot properly function or survive, and the   are completely dependent upon the continuous care of the adults. There are generally three  , or classes, within a colony:  , males, and workers. Male ants play no part in everyday nest activities. They live only for a short time, occur in limited numbers, and are virtual parasites of the colony, which must feed them. The fertile female, the queen, performs only one task: egg laying. The life cycle of the ant has four stages—egg, larva,  , and adult—and typically spans a period of 8 to 10 weeks for worker ants. At certain times of the year, the winged males and virgin queens   into the air, where the queen mates with a single male. During the flight he transfers to her   receptacle all the   she will require for the rest of her life, which may be as long as 15 years. The males die soon afterward, and the fertilized queen establishes a new nest or takes over the current nest. Her wings then drop off, and the bulky wing muscles degenerate, providing nutritive materials from the breakdown of the   tissue. As soon as the wings have fallen, her ovaries become functional, and egg laying begins. In primitive species, the queen leaves the nest and forages for food for the larvae. In more advanced forms, the queen rarely leaves the nest. She feeds so-called nutrition eggs or other food stores within her own body to the first brood. The larvae that survive in the nest develop into dwarf workers, which   outside the nest for food to nourish additional larvae. The essential work in the ant society—such as building the nest, feeding and tending the brood, and defending the nest—is performed by the workers, all of whom are female. The workers can be   morphologically and physiologically as soldiers, outside workers, inside workers, and nest builders. In the division of labor among some ant forms, highly specialized types of   have developed. The   ants, for example, make nests in hollow stems of plants, then bore a circular entrance that remains under constant surveillance by special guards whose heads are modified into pluglike structures that fit the entrance. Each guard is relieved after several hours, and another guard takes its place; entrance guards are useless for other tasks.   repletes are a special type of worker that are fed so much that the size of their abdomens is greatly increased. Unable to walk, they hang as living honey jugs from the ceiling of the nest, to be used as a food source when fresh food is  . Most ants live in nests, which may be located in the ground or under a rock or built aboveground and made of twigs, sand, or gravel. Many subterranean nests are quite extensive, with a multitude of tunnels and specialized chambers.   ( ) are large black ants common in North America that live in old logs and timbers. Some species live in trees or in the hollow stems of weeds. Tailor, or weaver, ants, found in the tropics of Africa (e.g.,  ), make nests of leaves and similar materials held together with silk secreted by the larvae.  , a   of ants that are found worldwide, glues together bits of animal feces for its nest. The widely distributed pharaoh ant ( ), a small yellowish insect, builds its nest either in houses, when found in cool climates, or outdoors, when it occurs in warm climates. The food of ants consists of both plant and animal substances. Many ants are generalists and utilize a wide range of organic substances for food. Worker ants forage daily, and collected food and water is brought to the larvae and mature ants in the nest. They frequently use scent marks, which they place on their pathways, to find their way back to the nest and direct other colony members to a food source. Some ant species are hunters and scavengers. Bullet ants, for example,   for live  ,  , and  , including  , beetles, and  , or their carcasses. Certain species, including those of the genus  , often eat the eggs and larvae of other ants or those of their own species in other nests.   (genus  ) scavenge for dead insects on the scorching sand and salt-pan terrain of the  ; they can tolerate surface temperatures of 60 °C (140 °F) or higher for short periods, making them one of the most heat-tolerant groups of insects known. Some species eat the liquid secretions of plants, either directly or indirectly from the bodies of other insects. Many ants collect   from floral or extrafloral  , and some     and  . A number of ants, known as herder ants (  and others), protect and carefully tend to herds of  , from which the ants collect honeydew (a by-product of digestion secreted by certain aphids). The   ( ,  , and others) store honeydew in the distended abdomens of specialized workers. Some genera ( ) eat the honeydew that has fallen onto the surface of a leaf. The so-called Argentine ant ( ) and many   ( ) also eat honeydew.  ( ,  ) store grass, seeds, or berries in the nest, whereas ants of the genus   of   eat only  , which they   in their nests. The Texas   ( ) is a   that often strips the leaves from plants to provide nourishment for its fungus gardens. The social behavior of ants, along with that of  , is the most complex in the insect world. The group is also extremely  , with any number of foraging, nesting, and social behaviors. Acacia ants ( ) inhabit the bullhorn acacia (or bullhorn wattle;  ). The ants obtain food and shelter, and the acacia depends on the ants for protection from browsing animals, which the ants drive away. Neither member can survive successfully without the other, exemplifying obligative  . Slave-making ants, of which there are many species, have a variety of methods for “enslaving” the ants of other species. The queen of   of Africa, for example, allows herself to be dragged by   ants into their nest. She then bites off the head of the   queen and begins laying her own eggs, which are cared for by the “enslaved”   workers. Workers of the slave-making ant   raid nests of   ants, stealing the latter’s pupae. The pupae are raised by   to serve as slaves, and, because the   pupae become imprinted on the chemical odor of the slave-making ants, as adults the captive ants forage and routinely return to the slave-making ant nest.

In these species the   larvae are given food and nourishment by the host workers.   is a parasite in the nests of  , the most common ant of northern Africa. , of the subfamily Dorylinae, are nomadic and   for the destruction of plant and animal life in their path. The army ants of tropical America ( ), for example, travel in columns, eating insects and other invertebrates along the way. Periodically, the colony rests for several days while the queen lays her eggs. As the colony travels, the growing larvae are carried along by the workers. Habits of the   ( ) are similar.

Some of the most pressing problems in human affairs—expanding populations, food scarcities,   including  , extinctions of   and    , and all the attendant sociological and political problems—are to a great degree ecological. The word   was coined by the German zoologist  , who applied the term   to the “relation of the animal both to its organic as well as its inorganic environment.” The word comes from the Greek  , meaning “household,” “home,” or “place to live.” Thus, ecology deals with the organism and its environment. The concept of   includes both other organisms and physical surroundings. It involves relationships between individuals within a population and between individuals of different populations. These interactions between individuals, between populations, and between organisms and their environment form ecological systems, or  s. Ecology has been defined variously as “the study of the interrelationships of organisms with their environment and each other,” as “the economy of nature,” and as “the   of ecosystems.” Ecology had no firm beginnings. It evolved from the natural history of the ancient Greeks, particularly  , a friend and associate of  . Theophrastus first described the interrelationships between organisms and between organisms and their nonliving environment. Later foundations for modern ecology were laid in the early work of plant and animal physiologists. In the early and mid-1900s two groups of botanists, one in   and the other in the  , studied plant   from two different points of view. The European botanists concerned themselves with the study of the  , structure, and distribution of plant communities. The American botanists studied the   of plant communities, or succession (   ). Both plant and animal ecology developed separately until American biologists emphasized the interrelation of both plant and animal communities as a biotic whole. During the same period, interest in     developed. The study of population dynamics received special   in the early 19th century, after the English economist   called attention to the conflict between expanding populations and the capability of   to supply food. In the 1920s the American zoologist  , the American chemist and statistician Alfred J. Lotka, and the Italian mathematician   developed mathematical foundations for the study of populations, and these studies led to experiments on the interaction of predators and  , competitive relationships between species, and the regulation of populations. Investigations of the influence of behaviour on populations were stimulated by the recognition in 1920 of territoriality in nesting birds.   of instinctive and   were developed by the Austrian zoologist   and the Dutch-born British zoologist  , and the role of social behaviour in the regulation of populations was explored by the British zoologist Vero Wynne-Edwards. (   .) While some ecologists were studying the dynamics of communities and populations, others were concerned with energy budgets. In 1920  August Thienemann, a German freshwater biologist, introduced the concept of trophic, or feeding, levels (   ), by which the energy of food is transferred through a series of organisms, from green plants (the producers) up to several levels of animals (the consumers). An English animal ecologist,   (1927), further developed this approach with the   of ecological  s and pyramids of numbers. In the 1930s, American freshwater biologists Edward Birge and Chancey Juday, in measuring the energy budgets of lakes, developed the idea of  , the rate at which food energy is generated, or fixed, by  . In 1942 Raymond L. Lindeman of the United States developed the trophic-dynamic concept of ecology, which details the flow of energy through the ecosystem. Quantified   studies of   through ecosystems were further developed by the brothers Eugene Odum and Howard Odum of the United States; similar early work on the cycling of   was done by J.D. Ovington of England and Australia. (   ;   and  .) The study of both energy flow and nutrient cycling was   by the development of new materials and techniques—radioisotope tracers, microcalorimetry,  , and applied mathematics—that enabled ecologists to label, track, and measure the movement of particular nutrients and energy through ecosystems. These modern methods (   ) encouraged a new stage in the development of ecology— , which is concerned with the structure and function of ecosystems.

About 90 percent of all flies occurring in human habitations are houseflies. Once a major nuisance and hazard to   in cities, houseflies are still a problem wherever decomposing organic waste and garbage are allowed to accumulate. The adult housefly is dull gray with dirty-yellowish areas on the abdomen and longitudinal lines on the  . Body size ranges from about 5 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 inch), and the     eyes have approximately 4,000 facets. Because it has sponging or lapping mouthparts, the housefly cannot bite; a near relative, the  , however, does bite. The housefly can walk on vertical window panes or hang upside down on a ceiling probably because of the surface-tension properties of a secretion produced by tiny glandular pads (pulvilli) beneath each claw on the feet. The female deposits more than 100 slender whitish eggs (0.8 to 1 mm long) at a time, producing between about 600 and 1,000 eggs in her life. These eggs hatch in 12 to 24 hours. After several molts the dirty-whitish   (larvae), about 12 mm long, transform into  . The adults, when developed, expand a pouch ( ptilinum) on the head and break off the end of the puparium to emerge. Houseflies may carry on their feet millions of microorganisms that, in large enough doses, can cause disease. Garbage, manure, and similar wastes that cannot be made inaccessible to flies can be treated with larvicidal drenches or dusts.     sprays are effective against flies for several weeks; however, some houseflies have developed resistance to certain insecticides, such as  .

Although many winged insects are commonly called flies, the name is strictly applicable only to members of Diptera. One of the largest   orders, it numbers more than 125,000 species that are relatively small, with soft bodies. Although the mouthparts of flies are of the sucking type, individuals show considerable variation in structure. Many flies are of great economic importance. Some bloodsuckers are serious pests of humans and other  . These insects, along with many scavenging flies, are important vectors of disease, whereas others are pests of    . Flies are  , too, functioning as scavengers, predators, or parasites of certain insect pests, as pollinators of plants, and as destroyers of   noxious to humans. Dipterous larvae, often called   or grubs, are found in many habitats (e.g., in any kind of water, in plant tissue and  , beneath   or stones, in decaying plant and   matter, even in pools of crude  ). Adults feed on plant or animal juices or other insects. Diptera fall into three large groups:   (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ),   (e.g.,  ,  ,  ), and   (e.g., flies that breed in vegetable or animal material, both living and dead). Flies range in size from midges of little more than 1 mm to robber flies more than 7 cm long. In general, the more-primitive flies (e.g., mosquitoes, midges, fungus gnats) are fragile insects with delicate wings. The more-advanced flies (e.g.,  ,  ) are generally squat, sturdy, and bristly. They are stronger fliers than midges and gnats. Diptera are   throughout the world: in the tropics, in the subarctic, at  , and high on mountains. They colonize beaches to low-tide level, but few go into deeper water, and only one or two midges are truly marine (e.g.,   in the Pacific). On the other hand, migrating flies have been found far out to sea. The abundance, worldwide distribution, and habits of flies combine to make them a nuisance to humans. Swarms of midges are a common annoyance. Sweat flies and face flies gather around the eyes, nose, and mouth and also suck   and   from wounds and sores. Such flies move constantly from one person to the next and in so doing may at times transfer   organisms. The   ( ) can be dangerous because it moves from person to food, drink, garbage, carrion, or feces. By transferring infective organisms from   material or from infected people, houseflies are agents in transmitting  ,  ,  , summer   in children, and other intestinal  - and  -caused diseases. Eye gnats are a nuisance in warm countries. Although the larvae are plant feeders, the small active adults feed on physiological secretions, particularly those around the eyes. Other flies pierce the skin of   and feed on their blood. Mosquitoes, black flies, sand flies, biting midges, and horse flies have evolved mandibles and maxillae that are bladelike, piercing stylets. These piercing organs are developed only in females, which use blood protein in egg production. Males do not feed on blood. Other groups of flies have evolved different mechanisms for obtaining blood.  , stable flies or biting houseflies ( ), and certain parasitic flies have developed a hard drill-like labium to replace the soft spongelike one. Both males and females have evolved this labium and both feed on blood. A few flies related to the housefly have a spongy proboscis equipped with small teeth for rasping skin around   and sores to increase the flow of blood and  . Other groups (e.g., robber flies) have developed a piercing   used only against other insects. The transmission of disease that occurs through the use of piercing organs such as a proboscis is considered mechanical transmission. Disease-causing organisms in the blood can be picked up by a   inserting its proboscis into an infected person. The disease may then be transmitted to another person when their skin is pierced by the bloodsucking fly, which injects its   into the wound. Without the anticoagulant properties of this saliva, bloodsucking would be impossible since the tiny hole drilled by the proboscis would clog with clotted blood. If the mouthparts are contaminated with blood that contains microorganisms, they can be injected, along with the saliva, into another person. This is called  direct   of disease and occurs only if the fly, interrupted during a meal, finds a new victim before the microorganisms die. One   that might be spread this way is  , caused by a bacterium found in wild  . Trappers who cut themselves while skinning animals can contract the disease.

Used in this sense, the term   commonly includes the primitive insects of the following groups:  , collembolans ( ),  , and   in the orders Zygentoma,  , and Monura (formerly the  ). The taxonomic status of the various groups that are considered apterygotes, however, remains unsettled. A typical apterygote, for example, is wingless and has six legs. The presence of six legs was once an important feature in the identification of true insects and enabled the identification of the apterygotes, including the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans and the now   Thysanura—the four groups that together made up the traditional subclass Apterygota (class Insecta). However, the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans are now considered by some entomologists to be offshoots from the main insectan stem of   and have been given independent taxonomic status as classes equivalent to the class  . The term  , therefore, is sometimes applied only to those groups thought to be ancestors of pterygotes—i.e., the  , fishmoths, and   (order Zygentoma) and the   (order Archaeognatha), together with the extinct   (order Monura). For completeness of discussion, however, and because of the similarities of these primitive hexapods, the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans, as well as orders Zygentoma, Archaeognatha, and Monura, are included in this article.  are minute (to 2 mm [0.08 inch] in length), elongated, and white and lack antennae. Distributed throughout the world in soil and leaf litter, they number about 800 species.   are   in form, coloration, and habitat. Most species are less than 3 mm (0.1 inch) in length, but some range to 10 mm (0.4 inch). They have either elongated or globular bodies with antennae and may have a furcula (ventral abdominal springing organ). Collembolans occur in   and leaf litter throughout the world, including  . There are more than 8,200 known species.   are white or yellowish, blind, elongated with long antennae, and less than 10 mm in length, although one group attains 50 mm (2 inches). Their two tail filaments (or threadlike structures) can be long and thin, short and thick, or in the form of pincers. Diplurans are widely distributed in soil, leaf litter, and rotting logs. More than 800 species have been described. Zygentoma and Archaeognatha are mainly long with three elongated tail filaments. Mostly 5 to 20 mm (0.2 to 0.8 inch) in length when fully grown, these insects are widely distributed in leaf litter, although some live in   and   nests. Zygentoma have small   eyes and styli (i.e., bristlelike processes) only on the  . Archaeognatha have large compound eyes and styli on the legs and abdomen. More than 350 species of Zygentoma and Archaeognatha are known. The largest of the extinct Monura were about 30 mm (1.2 inches) in length. The immature stages in all apterygotes are called  . The young are similar to adults, changing little (slight  ) from molt to molt until sexual maturity is attained. In some groups, molting may continue throughout adult life. The greatest changes occur in the Protura, which is the only anamorphic hexapod group (i.e., an increase in number of body segments occurs at time of molting). The complete number of segments is present only after the third molt. There are at least six stages between molts (instars), and the last is the adult. Little is known about the postembryonic development of Diplura. Most species feed on both living and dead vegetable matter and  , although one group preys on other small  . The   of the Collembola are diverse. Females may lay up to 800 eggs that hatch in 2 to 40 days. Three to 12 juvenile molts occur in intervals ranging from 11 days to a year, with up to 50 molts occurring in a lifetime, which can last from 4 to 18 months. Most Collembola feed on living or decaying   material as well as on fungi,  , and  , while a few feed on carrion or are predatory. In Zygentoma there may be more than 40 molts, although the adult stage is usually reached after about 12 molts. The   ( ) reaches sexual maturity in two or three years and molts multiple times in each   year (sometimes molting more than two dozen times in a single year). They can live as long as seven years. In Archaeognatha there are six instars including adults. Both Zygentoma and Archaeognatha feed on decaying or dried vegetable material. Domestic silverfish eat plant and   remains,  , and artificial  .  in apterygote groups is mainly sexual, but   (reproduction without  ) can occur. Males deposit   packets, often haphazardly, that are taken up by females and stored until the time for fertilization. In proturans small external genitalia of unusual form surround the gonopore in both sexes. Collembolans lack external genitalia, but the gonopore and surrounding area differ. In diplurans external genitalia are absent or vestigial. Zygentoma and Archaeognatha have external genitalia similar to those of the pterygotes. However, the   in males is used to deposit sperm drops and not as a copulative organ. The   and pickup of sperm drops in Zygentoma and Archaeognatha must take place during each adult stage if young are to be produced since the contents of the female sperm receptacle are lost with each molt.

More than 115,000 species have been described, including  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and lesser-known types. Except in the polar regions, they are abundant in most habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Collectively, the Hymenoptera are most important to humans as pollinators of wild and    , as   of destructive insects, and as makers of  . The Hymenoptera are divided into two suborders:   (mainly sawflies and horntails) and   (wasps, ants, bees, and most parasitic forms). The order includes the best known of the  —ants and some species of bees and wasps. Most species, however, are solitary in habit. Hymenopterans may be parasitic or nonparasitic, carnivorous, phytophagous, or omnivorous. Hymenopterans are chiefly small to medium-sized insects, usually with four membranous wings and a narrow waist that sets off the abdomen from the thorax, or middle region of the body. The mouthparts may be either of the biting type or of the biting-sucking type. In the higher evolutionary forms—bees, for example—mouthparts are modified into a sucking apparatus, although many also retain biting mandibles. The  , or egg-laying organ in the female, is often very long and may be modified for piercing, sawing, or stinging.   is complete; i.e., the insect develops through four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Sex is usually determined by whether or not an egg is fertilized, with fertilized eggs developing into females and unfertilized ones becoming males. Hymenoptera display an array of interesting behavioral characteristics, particularly in social species. The dancelike movements of   communicate information from one individual to another about the location, distance, quantity, and quality of a particular food source. These movements were carefully studied and described by the German entomologist  .  Trophallaxis, or the mutual exchange of food between larvae and adults of bees, ants, and wasps, has been of special interest to hymenopterists.  —the parasitic habit of one species upon another parasitic species—has also attracted attention.  , the development of many individuals (as many as 1,000) from a single egg, is an unusual phenomenon occurring in some members of the families Chalcididae and Proctotrupidae.   (production of young by females that are not fertilized by males) also occurs in some forms. Certain ants are remarkable for their relationship with insects such as aphids and scales that provide   or other sweet fluids. Ants that obtain sweet fluids from the caterpillars of certain species of blue butterflies (Lycaenidae)   by allowing the caterpillars to devour   larvae. The   (  in the  ,   in Africa) has in the nest a division of worker ants known as repletes, which are fed sugary secretions. As a consequence of high food intake, the abdomens of repletes swell into globules up to 1 cm (about 0.4 inch) in diameter. Hymenoptera, even those equipped with a sting, are sought as food by other animals. Skunks, badgers, field mice, shrews, and other animals attack   nests for the insects as well as for the honey. The larvae of the wax month ( ) live in bee nests, where they eat beeswax, thus damaging the nest. The cuckoo bee (Anthophorinae), a close relative of the  , lays its eggs in bumblebee nests, where the larvae are cared for and nourished by bumblebee workers. Hymenopterans range in size from the smallest fairyflies (Mymaridae), which are about 0.21 mm (about 0.008 inch) in length, to the largest of the Pelecinidae, which may exceed 5 cm (about 2 inches) in length. Principal differences in structure within the order include the presence or absence of wings that, when present, consist of two pairs; the presence or absence of a “waist”; modifications of the ovipositor; and   of mouthparts for specific eating habits. Polymorphism, the occurrence of two or more forms of a species, is highly developed in some of the social Hymenoptera. A   colony, for example, contains at least one queen, plus workers and drones, with each form being structurally and physiologically different from the others. Bees and wasps, as the most significant agents for the   of flowers, are found virtually everywhere that flowering plants occur. Social species may live in colonies of as many as 1,000,000 individuals. Ants are most numerous, both in numbers and in species, in tropical and subtropical regions. The number of ant species in arctic or Alpine regions is extremely small. The group appears to be   over great areas north of the  . The honeybee has been valued since pre-Christian times for its honey and beeswax. Beekeeping in modern times has become a lucrative and highly developed enterprise. Royal jelly, produced by honeybee workers, has enjoyed some popularity as a cosmetic, although its beneficial properties in this respect have not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Certain   forms are valuable control agents against insect pests. Notable among these are the parasitic wood wasps that attack wood-boring beetles; braconids that parasitize many   and wood-boring beetles; eulophids that parasitize scale insects; pteromalids that parasitize several crop pests; chalcids and trichogrammatids that parasitize a variety of orchard pests; and tiphiids that parasitize the  . Fig insects (Agaonidae) are valuable as the only pollinators of the Smyrna fig, an important crop in the Western United States. Relatively few Hymenoptera species are serious economic  . Chief among these, however, are the wheatstem   (Cephidae); some seed chalcids that are also pests of wheat; the larch sawfly ( ), which destroyed much of the larch forests in Britain and   late in the 19th century; and the European spruce sawfly ( ), which was once a serious pest in North America. In order to control the European spruce sawfly, parasitic wasps were introduced from Europe. The   ( ), accidentally introduced into the United States from  , feeds on young plants and seeds and is known to attack young mammals. The destructive habit of legionary ants, or   (Dorylinae), is of particular importance in South America. Armies of as many as 1,500,000 such insects destroy almost all   life they  .

Modern principles of other fields— ,  , and  , for example—are   with those of biology in areas such as  , biomedicine, and  . Biology is subdivided into separate branches for convenience of study, though all the subdivisions are interrelated by basic principles. Thus, while it is custom to separate the study of   ( ) from that of   ( ), and the study of the structure of organisms ( ) from that of function ( ), all living things share in common certain biological phenomena—for example, various means of  ,  , and the transmission of genetic material. Biology is often approached on the basis of levels that deal with fundamental units of life. At the level of  , for example, life is regarded as a   of chemical and   transformations that occur among the many chemical   that compose an organism. As a result of the   of increasingly powerful and precise laboratory instruments and techniques, it is possible to understand and define with high precision and accuracy not only the ultimate physiochemical organization (ultrastructure) of the molecules in living matter but also the way living matter reproduces at the molecular level. Especially crucial to those advances was the rise of   in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  is the study of cells—the fundamental units of structure and function in living organisms.   were first observed in the 17th century, when the     was invented. Before that time, the individual organism was studied as a whole in a field known as  organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.   biology deals with groups or populations of organisms that inhabit a given area or region. Included at that level are studies of the roles that specific kinds of plants and animals play in the complex and self-perpetuating interrelationships that exist between the living and the nonliving world, as well as studies of the built-in controls that maintain those relationships naturally. Those broadly based levels— , cells, whole organisms, and populations—may be further subdivided for study, giving rise to specializations such as  ,  , biophysics, biochemistry,  ,  , and  . A field of biology may be especially concerned with the investigation of one kind of living thing—for example, the study of   in  , the study of   in  , or the study of microorganisms in  . The concept of  —that living things maintain a constant internal environment—was first suggested in the 19th century by French physiologist  , who stated that “all the vital mechanisms, varied as they are, have only one object: that of preserving constant the conditions of life.” As originally conceived by Bernard,   applied to the struggle of a single organism to survive. The concept was later extended to include any biological system from the   to the entire  , all the areas of   inhabited by living things. All living organisms, regardless of their uniqueness, have certain biological, chemical, and physical characteristics in common. All, for example, are composed of basic units known as   and of the same chemical substances, which, when analyzed, exhibit noteworthy similarities, even in such   organisms as   and  . Furthermore, since the action of any organism is determined by the manner in which its cells interact and since all cells interact in much the same way, the basic functioning of all organisms is also similar. There is not only unity of basic living substance and functioning but also unity of origin of all living things. According to a theory proposed in 1855 by German pathologist  , “all living cells arise from pre-existing living cells.” That theory appears to be true for all living things at the present time under existing environmental conditions. If, however, life originated on Earth more than once in the past, the fact that all organisms have a sameness of basic structure,  , and function would seem to indicate that only one original type succeeded. A common origin of life would explain why in humans or bacteria—and in all forms of life in between—the same chemical substance, deoxyribonucleic acid ( ), in the form of   accounts for the ability of all living matter to replicate itself exactly and to transmit genetic information from parent to offspring. Furthermore, the mechanisms for that transmittal follow a pattern that is the same in all organisms.

Content: Biodiversity, also called biological diversity, is the variety of life found in a place on Earth or, often, the total variety of life on Earth. A common measure of this variety, called species richness, is the count of species in an area. Biodiversity also encompasses the genetic variety within each species and the variety of ecosystems that species create. Examining counts of species is the most common method used to compare the biodiversity of various places. A second way to weigh species biodiversity is to recognize the unique biodiversity of those habitats that contain few but unusual species, such as volcanoes, thermal vents, and hot springs. In practice, biodiversity is weighted differently for different species. The pace of decline and extinctions in biodiversity has risen dramatically over the last century, as the effects of climate change increased and human activities such as agriculture, fishing, and hunting continued to encroach into more remote natural areas all over the world. The United Nations named 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity. It was a yearlong celebration intended to raise public awareness about the importance of biodiversity and the need to reinforce conservation efforts.

When early man hunted animals and foraged for food, he shared the natural resources with other organisms in the  . As human   developed and population rose, people made ever-increasing demands on these resources. One result of changing the   has been a great increase in the number of species that are now recognized as competitors of humans. These competitors are usually referred to as pests. The definition of pest is, of course, subjective. An   would not necessarily consider several leaf-eating   on a plant as pests, whereas a gardener who   the plant might very well do so. And only one  ,  , or   is enough to qualify as a household pest. Natural   have always contained organisms that were economically significant; locusts, for example, have plagued humans throughout history, and grain from   locations has been found infected with   and   diseases. Most species that became pests, however, did so because of environmental modification, occasionally from natural causes but usually from human activities. In order to appreciate some of the methods devised to combat pests, one should consider how advancing   has increased the number of harmful   species. The change from natural vegetation to large areas of single-crop ( )   has three consequences. First, given a more uniform food source, some plant-eating species increase to large populations. Second, the uniform plant cover is easily invaded by attacking pests. Third, the introduction of new crops over large areas results in the transfer of previously harmless insects from scattered native plants to the new and abundant sources of food. Cultural practices such as fertilization,  , and the use of modern harvesting equipment (which often leaves large amounts of plant litter in the field)   still further the ability of pest species to increase rapidly. In addition, the elimination of species that compete with or prey upon pests—an unintended effect in some pest control programs—has also   certain pest problems. Also, the ease with which people and goods can be transported around the world has resulted in the introduction of exotic pests in many places. Pests are found throughout the   kingdom. Microorganisms such as fungi,  , and viruses are here considered with the pests even though they are usually thought of as agents of  . Most animal pests are invertebrates, among them protozoa, flatworms, nematodes, snails, slugs, insects, and mites. Among the vertebrates, rabbits, elk, deer, and many kinds of rodents are sometimes injurious to crops. Insects are also serious pests, especially those involved with the   of disease. Each year millions of lives, particularly in the tropics, are threatened by insect-borne diseases. Malaria and   are transmitted by mosquitoes,   by fleas, typhus by the  ,   by tsetse flies,   by blood-sucking bugs, and leishmaniasis by sandflies. Other diseases may be spread by insects accidentally as a result of their habits. The  , a pest responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of   in  , arrived in the   in the 1990s, probably embedded in shipping materials from eastern Asia. Pest control began to receive attention in the 18th century, and it has become increasingly important since then. As control programs were developed, they tended to fall primarily into two somewhat mutually   categories: chemical and biological. Physical or mechanical methods, including sticky barriers, heat killing (for storage pests), and flooding (for ground pests), were also developed. Because of their limited utility and short-term effectiveness, they have been superseded largely by chemical and biological methods. The chemical, or  , approach probably began with the use of poisonous plant  —ground tobacco was used in France to kill aphids about 1763. Other natural products such as nicotine, rotenone, petroleum, kerosene, creosote, and turpentine were used in the 19th century. Inorganic compounds such as Paris green, lime sulfur, Bordeaux mixture,  , and lead arsenate were also introduced in the 1800s. With the appearance of the   organic compounds during  , a dramatic change occurred in pest control. Some organic compounds, such as the dinitrophenols, had been used earlier, but the discovery of the insecticidal properties of   (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) and of BHC ( ) made the concept of pest-free crops possible. Research in the 1930s on plant hormones and related compounds led to the development of the selective   2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), and this became commercially available about the same time as DDT. Following the appearance of these new synthetic organic compounds, a whole new series of pesticides—insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and plant growth regulators—was introduced. Although the ancient Chinese used predacious ants to control foliage-feeding insects, the control of pests by biological means appears to have been initiated in the Western world with the importation of the Indian Mynah   into Mauritius in 1762 to control the red locust. Control of bedbugs by predatory agents was recommended in 1776. A number of other projects in   were carried out in the 1800s, but the modern era in this phase of pest control began in 1888 with the importation into California of the vedalia   ( ) to control the   ( ). This beetle, imported from  , saved the citrus-fruit industry. The use of plants resistant to insects was suggested about 1788 as a means of controlling the  , a pest of wheat. The classic example of this approach was the control of phylloxera, aphid-like insects that attacked the root stocks of the European wine grape and almost ruined the European wine industry. The solution lay in grafting the European wine grape onto resistant American stocks. The effort, about 1900, to control the lantana shrub in Hawaii by introducing an insect appears to have been the first attempt to control weeds biologically. The use of microorganisms to destroy insect pests began in the late 1800s and early 1900s. With the appearance of the synthetic organic insecticides, however, emphasis was placed on chemical control, and biological means fell into neglect. The extensive use of powerful chemical agents soon resulted in a number of serious ecological problems. Consequently, current pest control practice minimizes the use of pesticides and combines them with biological methods in an approach called  . The   control of an insect that attacks crops may, for example, involve the   of pest-resistant   varieties; the development of crop   methods that   pest proliferation; the release of organisms that are predators or parasites of the pest species; the placement of traps baited with the pest’s own sex attractants (pheromones); the disruption of the pest’s reproduction by the release of sterilized pests; and, often as a last resort, the application of chemical insecticides. Other important tools of modern pest control or importation and quarantine regulations, which are designed to prevent the introduction of exotic pests.

(Some authorities use the name Hemiptera; others consider both the heteropterans and the homopterans to be suborders of the Hemiptera.) This large group of insects, consisting of more than 40,000 species, can be recognized by an X-shaped design on the back, which is formed by the wings at rest. A combination of features—sucking mouthparts adapted to pierce plant or   tissues and a hardened gula (underside of the head)—separate the heteropterans from all other insect orders. Although most species of Heteroptera are terrestrial, a few are aquatic. Some species, which feed on plant juices, are serious pests of   crops. Other species are predacious and benefit humans by destroying various pests. There also are heteropterans that act as carriers of disease. Heteropterans can be divided into three large groups on the basis of general habitat: the water-dwelling Hydrocorisae ( ,  ,  ,  , and  ); the surface-swimming and shore-dwelling Amphibicorisae ( ,   and  ,  , and  ); and the Geocorisae, a large group of land bugs ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  ). Like any other biologically successful group of organisms, the heteropterans are   and   and have adapted to a variety of habitats. They range in length from more than 100 mm (3.9 inches) to less than 1 mm (0.039 inch) and have invaded habitats from dry land to water. One of the few insect groups with aquatic adults capable of obtaining adequate oxygen from the water, heteropterans include the only insect species that spend their lives on oceans far from land. Some heteropterans are nourished by blood of animals ranging from mites to humans. Others feed from the sap of plants as diverse as giant redwoods and algae. Some suck surface fluids (e.g., nectar), some pierce tissues to suck sap or blood, and others obtain nourishment from dried seeds. Many forms live on open surfaces and escape enemies by running, flying, or remaining inconspicuously motionless. Some seek food and shelter in natural crevices, and others actively burrow into the soil or seek out the nests of animals. Heteropterans are most   in the tropics, decreasing in both individuals and species to limits northward beyond the   and southward almost to the  . Every major landmass harbours different species, and migrations to new habitats may be aided by natural agents (e.g., wind, birds, floating debris) or by humans. Although heteropterans have been carried throughout the world, only a few species have become established in many lands. Unique among insects are some water striders (Gerridae), which are at home on the open ocean between approximately 40° north latitude and 40° south latitude and may not approach land for several generations. More than 40,000 species of heteropterans are known. Most families containing 150 or more species are represented in every  . Two exceptions are the Phymatidae (ambush bugs), with no species known in Australia or the  , and the Plataspidae, with no New World species. Families with the fewest species have the most restricted ranges: Aphylidae, Hyocephalidae, and Lestoniidae are restricted to Australia and contain among them only five species. The Velocipedidae of the Orient and the Vianaididae of the American tropics number four species each. In general, zoogeographic restriction is most evident at the subfamily, tribal, and generic levels. Heteropterans have complex and important roles in the balance of nature. The majority of them occupy an intermediate position in the ecological food chain; they use food producers (plants) and serve as food sources for   and other animals. A few species utilize plant-feeding insects as food. Heteropterans often serve as food for humans and other animals. In some Latin American countries eggs of certain aquatic bugs are collected by providing submerged mats of hollow reeds or straws as egg-laying sites; the eggs are then dried and made into cakes. Chickens, turkeys, hogs, and other domestic stock consume available heteropterans. Aquatic bugs are an important food source for fish. Wild birds and mammals, from the wrens and shrews to the turkey and  , utilize available heteropterans in their diets. Species that attack unwanted plants and feed on the eggs, immature stages, and adults of injurious insects include most assassin bugs,  , anthocorid bugs, stinkbugs, and plant bugs. These heteropterans are used in   of   weeds and injurious insects.

Genetics forms one of the central pillars of   and overlaps with many other areas, such as agriculture,  , and  . Since the dawn of civilization, humankind has recognized the influence of heredity and applied its principles to the improvement of   crops and domestic animals. A Babylonian tablet more than 6,000 years old, for example, shows  s of horses and indicates possible inherited characteristics. Other old carvings show cross-  of   trees. Most of the mechanisms of heredity, however, remained a mystery until the 19th century, when genetics as a systematic   began. Genetics arose out of the identification of genes, the fundamental units responsible for heredity. Genetics may be defined as the study of  s at all levels, including the ways in which they act in the   and the ways in which they are transmitted from parents to offspring. Modern genetics focuses on the chemical substance that genes are made of, called deoxyribonucleic acid, or  , and the ways in which it affects the chemical reactions that   the living processes within the cell. Gene action depends on interaction with the  . Green  s, for example, have genes containing the information necessary to synthesize the photosynthetic pigment   that gives them their green colour. Chlorophyll is synthesized in an environment containing light because the gene for chlorophyll is expressed only when it interacts with light. If a plant is placed in a dark environment, chlorophyll synthesis stops because the gene is no longer expressed. Genetics as a scientific   stemmed from the work of   in the middle of the 19th century. Mendel suspected that traits were inherited as discrete units, and, although he knew nothing of the physical or chemical nature of genes at the time, his units became the basis for the development of the present understanding of heredity. All present research in genetics can be traced back to Mendel’s discovery of the laws governing the inheritance of traits. The word   was introduced in 1905 by English biologist  , who was one of the discoverers of Mendel’s work and who became a champion of Mendel’s principles of inheritance. Although scientific evidence for patterns of genetic inheritance did not appear until Mendel’s work, history shows that humankind must have been interested in heredity long before the dawn of civilization. Curiosity must first have been based on   family resemblances, such as similarity in body structure, voice, gait, and gestures. Such notions were instrumental in the establishment of family and royal  . Early   were interested in the qualities of the animals that they herded and domesticated and, undoubtedly, bred selectively. The first human settlements that practiced farming appear to have selected crop plants with favourable qualities. Ancient tomb paintings show racehorse breeding pedigrees containing clear depictions of the inheritance of several distinct physical traits in the horses. Despite this interest, the first recorded speculations on heredity did not exist until the time of the ancient Greeks; some aspects of their ideas are still considered relevant today.  (  460–  375  ), known as the father of medicine, believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics, and, to account for this, he devised the   known as  . He postulated that all organs of the body of a parent gave off invisible “seeds,” which were like miniaturized building components and were transmitted during  , reassembling themselves in the mother’s womb to form a baby.  (384–322  ) emphasized the importance of   in heredity. He thought that the blood supplied generative material for building all parts of the adult body, and he reasoned that blood was the basis for passing on this generative power to the next generation. In fact, he believed that the male’s semen was purified blood and that a woman’s menstrual blood was her equivalent of semen. These male and female contributions united in the womb to produce a baby. The blood contained some type of hereditary essences, but he believed that the baby would develop under the influence of these essences, rather than being built from the essences themselves. Aristotle’s ideas about the role of blood in procreation were probably the origin of the still prevalent notion that somehow the blood is involved in heredity. Today people still speak of certain traits as being “in the blood” and of “blood lines” and “blood ties.” The Greek model of inheritance, in which a teeming multitude of substances was  , differed from that of the Mendelian model. Mendel’s idea was that distinct differences between individuals are determined by differences in single yet powerful hereditary factors. These single hereditary factors were identified as genes. Copies of genes are transmitted through   and egg and guide the development of the offspring. Genes are also responsible for reproducing the distinct features of both parents that are visible in their children. In the two millennia between the lives of   and  , few new ideas were recorded on the nature of  . In the 17th and 18th centuries the idea of preformation was introduced. Scientists using the newly developed s imagined that they could see miniature   of human beings inside sperm heads. French biologist   invoked the idea of “the inheritance of acquired characters,” not as an explanation for heredity but as a model for  . He lived at a time when the fixity of species was taken for granted, yet he maintained that this fixity was only found in a constant environment. He enunciated the  law of use and disuse, which states that when certain organs become specially developed as a result of some environmental need, then that state of development is hereditary and can be passed on to progeny. He believed that in this way, over many generations,  s could arise from deerlike animals that had to keep stretching their necks to reach high leaves on trees. British naturalist   originally   the theory of evolution by  . However,  ’s observations during his circumnavigation of the globe aboard the HMS   (1831–36) provided evidence for natural selection and his suggestion that humans and animals shared a common ancestry. Many scientists at the time believed in a hereditary mechanism that was a version of the ancient Greek idea of pangenesis, and Darwin’s ideas did not appear to fit with the theory of heredity that sprang from the experiments of Mendel.

Some of the most pressing problems in human affairs—expanding populations, food scarcities,   including  , extinctions of   and    , and all the attendant sociological and political problems—are to a great degree ecological. The word   was coined by the German zoologist  , who applied the term   to the “relation of the animal both to its organic as well as its inorganic environment.” The word comes from the Greek  , meaning “household,” “home,” or “place to live.” Thus, ecology deals with the organism and its environment. The concept of   includes both other organisms and physical surroundings. It involves relationships between individuals within a population and between individuals of different populations. These interactions between individuals, between populations, and between organisms and their environment form ecological systems, or  s. Ecology has been defined variously as “the study of the interrelationships of organisms with their environment and each other,” as “the economy of nature,” and as “the   of ecosystems.” Ecology had no firm beginnings. It evolved from the natural history of the ancient Greeks, particularly  , a friend and associate of  . Theophrastus first described the interrelationships between organisms and between organisms and their nonliving environment. Later foundations for modern ecology were laid in the early work of plant and animal physiologists. In the early and mid-1900s two groups of botanists, one in   and the other in the  , studied plant   from two different points of view. The European botanists concerned themselves with the study of the  , structure, and distribution of plant communities. The American botanists studied the   of plant communities, or succession (   ). Both plant and animal ecology developed separately until American biologists emphasized the interrelation of both plant and animal communities as a biotic whole. During the same period, interest in     developed. The study of population dynamics received special   in the early 19th century, after the English economist   called attention to the conflict between expanding populations and the capability of   to supply food. In the 1920s the American zoologist  , the American chemist and statistician Alfred J. Lotka, and the Italian mathematician   developed mathematical foundations for the study of populations, and these studies led to experiments on the interaction of predators and  , competitive relationships between species, and the regulation of populations. Investigations of the influence of behaviour on populations were stimulated by the recognition in 1920 of territoriality in nesting birds.   of instinctive and   were developed by the Austrian zoologist   and the Dutch-born British zoologist  , and the role of social behaviour in the regulation of populations was explored by the British zoologist Vero Wynne-Edwards. (   .) While some ecologists were studying the dynamics of communities and populations, others were concerned with energy budgets. In 1920  August Thienemann, a German freshwater biologist, introduced the concept of trophic, or feeding, levels (   ), by which the energy of food is transferred through a series of organisms, from green plants (the producers) up to several levels of animals (the consumers). An English animal ecologist,   (1927), further developed this approach with the   of ecological  s and pyramids of numbers. In the 1930s, American freshwater biologists Edward Birge and Chancey Juday, in measuring the energy budgets of lakes, developed the idea of  , the rate at which food energy is generated, or fixed, by  . In 1942 Raymond L. Lindeman of the United States developed the trophic-dynamic concept of ecology, which details the flow of energy through the ecosystem. Quantified   studies of   through ecosystems were further developed by the brothers Eugene Odum and Howard Odum of the United States; similar early work on the cycling of   was done by J.D. Ovington of England and Australia. (   ;   and  .) The study of both energy flow and nutrient cycling was   by the development of new materials and techniques—radioisotope tracers, microcalorimetry,  , and applied mathematics—that enabled ecologists to label, track, and measure the movement of particular nutrients and energy through ecosystems. These modern methods (   ) encouraged a new stage in the development of ecology— , which is concerned with the structure and function of ecosystems.

The world’s most abundant creatures are the insects, whose known species outnumber all the other animals and the plants combined. Insects have been so successful in their fight for life that they are sometimes described as the human race’s closest rivals for domination of the Earth. Entomologists, the scientists who study insects, have named almost 1,000,000 species—perhaps less than one third of the total number. Insects thrive in almost any habitat where life is possible. Some are found only in the Arctic regions, and some live only in deserts. Others thrive only in fresh water or only in brackish water. Many species of insects are able to tolerate both freezing and tropical temperatures. Such hardy species are often found to range widely over the Earth. Few insects, however, inhabit marine environments. Small size, relatively minor food requirements, and rapid reproduction have all aided in perpetuating the many species of insects. Certain parasitic insects spend much of their lives on or within the body of an animal host, where all the comforts of life—food, moisture, warmth, protection from enemies—are optimal. Other kinds of insects spend all or some part of their lives securely enclosed in a food plant. Some species have become remarkably versatile in order to meet the changing demands of the environment. Various water bugs and water beetles are able to fly and swim, as well as crawl. Many types of insects, such as the bees, ants, and wasps depend on a complex social structure and defensive behavior. Nonpredatory species frequently have special defenses, such as an unpleasant taste or odor, venomous spines, or camouflage. Although they are adaptable and versatile as a group, insects are often unable to adjust to unusual weather conditions. Excessive rain, an unusually early frost, an extended drought—these and other weather extremes can quickly wipe out or drastically reduce insect populations in a region. Because insects are an important item in the diet of many other animals—birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, as well as other insects—the number is constantly held in check. The total of all factors unfavorable to insect survival is overwhelming; thus, in some species, out of hundreds of eggs laid by a single female, seldom do more than a few individuals reach adulthood. The survival of some species is enhanced by the large numbers of eggs laid. 


Despite their diversity, all adult insects share some basic external and internal anatomical features. Insects are distinguished from other members of the animal kingdom by having six legs; one pair of antennae; a ringed, or segmented, body; and three well-defined body regions. It is from the joined body rings, or segments, that insects derived their name, for the Latin word   means “segmented.” Many creatures closely resemble insects and are often mistaken for them—for instance, spiders and scorpions, which have eight legs; centipedes, which have dozens of legs; and mites and ticks, which have saclike bodies unbroken by segments. The name bug refers to certain insects with piercing and sucking mouthparts but is also commonly applied to insects in general. 

The three main sections of an insect body are the head; the middle section, or thorax; and the hind section, or abdomen. The body is covered with a horny substance containing chitin. The protective armor plate also serves as an external skeleton, or  , for the support of the internal organs. 

The head bears the antennae, the mouthparts, and the eyes. The thorax has three segments; on each is a pair of legs. In winged insects the thorax also bears one or two pairs of wings. The abdomen typically has 11 segments, though no more than 10 are visible; it contains a large part of the digestive system. In females the ovipositor, or egg-laying organ, is located at the tip of the abdomen. The nervous system of the insect includes a brain and a pair of parallel nerve cords, which extend along the length of the underside of the body. Along the nerve cords are a series of nerve masses, called ganglia. Each ganglion controls certain activities and is more or less independent of the others. Insect blood is usually green, yellow, or colorless. Few insects have red blood. The fluid is not enclosed in a system of arteries, veins, and capillaries but fills the body cavity. It is circulated by a tube that extends down the length of the body along the center of the back. The tube has valved intake openings along its sides and is open at the anterior, or front, end. By means of muscles, it draws the blood through the side openings and pumps it forward into the head cavity and out again into the body. The pulsations of the tube can be easily seen in light-colored caterpillars. Air enters the body through breathing pores, called spiracles. A pair of spiracles is usually found on each of two thoracic segments and on several abdominal segments. From the spiracles, large air tubes called tracheae and smaller ones known as tracheoles carry air to all parts of the body. Some water insects breathe by means of gills. Other aquatic insects have a snorkellike tube that leads to the water’s surface. Certain internal parasites and very primitive insects breathe directly through the body wall. 

Mouthparts vary with feeding habits. For example, the mouth of a chewing insect, such as the grasshopper, has several parts. There is an upper lip, the labrum, and a lower lip, the labium. Between these are two pairs of jaws, which work sideways. The upper jaws, or mandibles, are for crushing; the lower pair, the maxillae, manipulate the food. On the maxillae and on the labium are two pairs of sensory structures called palpi. On the floor of the mouth is the tonguelike hypopharynx, which secretes digestive juices. The sucking type of mouth is a modification of the chewing type. The butterfly’s coiled proboscis, or sucking tube, is a modification of the maxillae. The sense organs of insects are as varied as they are intricate. In some of these creatures the visual organs are capable of nothing more than distinguishing night from day. Others have eyes as efficient and sensitive as those of the vertebrates. 

Insect eyes are of two general types—simple and compound. Simple eyes, also called ocelli, are usually located in small clusters on the sides of the head or on the frons, or forehead. Although small, they may easily be seen by means of a magnifying glass. Ocelli are found in both immature and mature insects, but they appear to be more important in the mature forms. Individually these organs can do no more than detect light; however, the sensations received by several ocelli can together produce in the insect’s brain an image of the surrounding area as the creature turns its head from side to side. Compound eyes, like the sight organs of higher animals, are present in pairs, with one eye on each side of the head. They are most common in adult insects. Some—certain mayflies, for example—have two pairs of compound eyes. The eyes are called compound because each one is composed of many lenslike facets. Each of these facets—of which there are, for example, some 25,000 in a single dragonfly eye—receives a separate image. The total effect of these images is a composite picture in the insect’s brain. The eyes of many insects—bees, for example—are sensitive to ultraviolet light, but insect eyes are generally less sensitive to colors at the red end of the  . The antennae are vital structures, because organs of taste, touch, smell, and hearing may be located in them. The loss of the pair of antennae usually leaves the insect in a shocked and helpless state. Their appearance and structure may vary greatly, even between insects of the same order. The hearing organs of insects are well developed in many species and are found on various parts of the body. The ears of katydids and crickets are located on the tibiae of the forelegs. The typical grasshopper’s ear is clearly visible as an oval plate on the first abdominal segment. Insect sounds are produced by specialized structures to attract the opposite sex, to communicate with other members of a group, or to frighten enemies. Wings or mouthparts may be rubbed together. Legs may be scraped against wings or bodies. The grubs of certain wood-boring beetles produce sound by rubbing their legs together. The male cicada vibrates miniature “drumheads” on the lower surface of its abdomen. The song of the female mosquito comes from the vibration of special bands stretched across its breathing organs. 


The development from egg to adult is most interesting, especially in those insects that go through the complex changes called complete metamorphosis. The growth of insects is quite different from that of vertebrates because the insect skeleton is an external covering rather than an internal framework. Except for the pliable fold between the plates of chitinous cuticle making up the exoskeleton, there is no place where expansion can occur; thus the growing insect must periodically shed, or molt, its covering. The new skin, already formed, then expands and begins to harden. The offspring of all insects undergo a varying number of such growth intervals before maturity. Adult insects do not grow at all. With the exception of the subimago (subadult) stage of the mayfly, only adults have functional wings. Primitive species such as silverfish mature with little change in appearance except their size. These kinds of insects are known as ametabolous insects. The immature insects of such species are called simply the “young.” Immature grasshoppers, cicadas, the true bugs, and a number of other types resemble the adults in many respects but lack functional wings. Such young, called nymphs, are hemimetabolous or are said to exhibit incomplete metamorphosis. A variation of such development occurs in dragonflies, mayflies, and caddis flies. The nymphs of these forms are aquatic and have a way of life quite unlike that of the adults. Bees, beetles, butterflies, and moths are some of the insects that go through all the changes of complete metamorphosis. They are said to be holometabolous. The young are called larvae (singular, larva). In the inactive stage immediately preceding adulthood they are called pupae (singular, pupa). 


The larva hatches from an egg. Often larvae are mistaken for worms. They may be smooth-bodied, like the maggots of the fly, or hairy, like some caterpillars (literally, “hairy cat”), or they may be vicious-looking, like the grub of the tiger beetle. Larvae are classified into five forms, based on their shape: eruciform (caterpillarlike), scarabaeiform (grublike), campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active), elateriform (wirewormlike), and vermiform (maggotlike). Larvae differ from adults in many respects. The mouthparts may be completely different. The mouth is always well developed, for this stage is the hungriest period of the insect’s life. Eyes, if present, are usually simple rather than compound. Certain structures found in the larva may be absent in the adult. Caterpillars, for example, have several additional legs, called prolegs, along the abdomen. 





Near the end of its larval stage, the insect must find a place in which to pupate, or turn into a pupa. Beetle larvae, as well as certain caterpillars, may hollow out cells in the soil. Some caterpillars may spin silken cocoons about their bodies; some may spin bands to hold themselves against twigs or leaves. Some caterpillars hang upside down from silken pads. Hairy caterpillars pluck out their hairs to line the walls of their cocoons.     The pupal stage is a time of tissue transformation. During this period different kinds of mouthparts, legs, eyes, and, perhaps, breathing organs must replace those of the larva. When the changes are completed, the creature bursts out of its old skin to become a fully developed insect. In this final, sexually mature state, it is also known as an imago.   Each species of insect, in its struggle for survival, has developed complex behavior mechanisms and habits. These involve every activity of daily life—including egg laying, nest building, self-defense, and the search for food. Most species of insects are of two sexes, but in some—the white-fringed beetle, for example—males are unknown. In certain insects the sex of the offspring depends upon whether or not the egg has been fertilized. The unmated females of some parasitic wasps produce males only, while mated ones produce the two sexes in about equal numbers. The queen honeybee can lay either fertilized or unfertilized eggs, according to the needs of the hive. Unfertilized eggs produce drones, while fertilized eggs produce females. 

The adult female instinctively places her eggs in a place suitable for their hatching and for proper development of the young. Parasitic wasps and flies place their eggs directly on the host. The horse botfly glues her eggs to the hairs of the horse where they can be licked off and thus be transferred to the horse’s stomach; the larvae live on the lining of the stomach and intestines. If a caterpillar feeds on only one species of plant, then the egg from which it will hatch is unerringly placed upon that plant. 

Often insects’ eggs are hidden in special protective materials. They may be encased in frothy secretions which dry to form a hard covering, or clusters of eggs may be coated with hairs or scales from the adult insect’s body. The eggs of many species are inserted directly into plant tissues by means of sawlike or spearlike ovipositors. 

The young of some insects are born alive. Such insects are called viviparous (from Latin  , “alive,” and  , “bring forth”), to distinguish them from egg-laying insects, which are called oviparous (from Latin  , “egg”). Aphids sometimes lay eggs and sometimes produce live young; female aphids also bear young for many generations without mating. This is called parthenogenesis (from the Greek words meaning “virgin birth”). A few insects reproduce in the larval or pupal stages. This is known as paedogenesis (from the Greek words meaning “birth from young”). 

Nest building as an adult activity is peculiar to ants, wasps, and bees. Carpenter ants live in galleries, which they chew out of tree trunks, logs, and fence posts. Mound-building ants construct cities in the soil, with thousands of chambers and passageways. The great paper apartment houses of the paper wasps and the honeycombs of the bees are considered to be marvels of engineering. 

Nesting species must feed their larvae. Ants forage for food for their young. Some species raise fungus gardens and cultivate aphid “cows,” whose liquid excrement, or honeydew, they eat. The mud dauber wasp lays its eggs in tubes of mud. It then stocks the tubes with paralyzed spiders and seals the tubes. After the larvae hatch, a sufficient food supply is at hand until they pupate. Each species of insect usually passes the winter in one particular phase of development. Some butterflies winter as pupae, caterpillars, or eggs. The monarch butterfly migrates long distances southward in the fall; some survive for a return flight in the spring. In the winter some insects may come out of hibernation during brief periods of mild weather. Snow scorpion flies and springtails are often found on snow or ice. Honeybees in well-protected hives use their body heat to maintain a hive temperature that permits them to remain somewhat active and to feed on stored sweets. They leave the hive when the temperature rises to about 55°  F (13°  C). Extreme heat or drought brings about a period of inactivity called estivation. The eggs of mosquitoes do not hatch and the nymphs and adults of many aquatic insects become dormant when the breeding ponds and marshes dry up. Insects have developed many methods of self-defense to avoid being devoured by their enemies. Flight, concealment, motion, armor and weapons, and even grotesqueness are some of these methods. Certain insects are specially adapted for hiding. Vast numbers hide beneath stones or the bark of trees. The flattened bodies of cockroaches and bedbugs enable them to disappear into narrow cracks. 


The most interesting means of concealment are   and  . The walkingstick looks like a twig. Certain moths blend so well into the bark of the tree on which they rest that they cannot be distinguished from the tree. Some harmless insects resemble stinging species in shape or color and so are avoided by predators. Certain moths and flies mimic bees. Armor and weapons are well developed in many insects. The tough, horny covering of the beetles amounts to a solid shell of armor. Sharp jaws and beaks, poisoned stingers, and spines serve as effective weapons. The extreme hairiness of some caterpillars makes birds and other predators avoid them, and in some caterpillars the hairs have venomous spines. Stink glands in some insects repel attackers in the same way as those in a skunk. When disturbed, the bombardier beetle ejects an irritating gas from its tail. The gas may be fired repeatedly and audibly. Grasshoppers exude a fluid popularly known as “tobacco juice.” The flavor of some insects is so bitter or sour that would-be predators avoid eating them. Insects are not able to reason. They are guided by instinct and by physiological reactions to their environment. Such reactions are called tropisms, from the Greek word  , meaning “turn.” All tropisms involve turning toward or away from a stimulus. Through chemotropism, chemical stimuli help insects find places to lay their eggs. The carrion beetle, for example, deposits eggs on decayed meat—drawn to it by odor. Butterflies and bees are attracted to flowers by odor as well as color. The scent glands of various insects help them attract a mate. Insects also avoid certain substances by chemotropic reactions. Clothes chests made of cedar or camphor wood have long been used for storing woolens and furs because these woods contain substances repellent to clothes moths. Many insects seem to be attracted to or repelled by light (phototropism). Moths are attracted to artificial light and moonlight but avoid sunlight. Butterflies react in the opposite way. Cockroaches in a dark room hide when a light is turned on.     Response to gravity (geotropism) may govern the way various boring insects react. Thermotropism, or attraction to heat, may draw parasites to their warm-blooded hosts. Thigmotropism is reaction to touch. Some insects avoid all contact with others; some thrive in close contact. The swarming of bees may be due to an attraction to one another’s bodies. Attraction to water (hydrotropism), adjustment to currents of streams (rheotropism), and adjustment to air currents (anemotropism) may explain the behavior of a wide variety of insects. However, no single stimulus governs all of their complex activities.   Insects belong to the phylum Arthropoda, one of the chief divisions of the   kingdom. The name comes from two Greek words,   (“joint”) and   (“foot”), and refers to the jointed feet. Arthropods also include spiders, lobsters, centipedes, and other animals. In this phylum, insects belong to the class Insecta. Each insect has two parts to its scientific name. For example, the housefly is   The first half of the name is that of the genus (a group of closely related species) to which the species   belongs. The many thousands of insect genera (plural of genus) are grouped under more than 900 families. These families, in turn, are grouped under as many as 30 orders. To summarize, the housefly is classified as follows: kingdom, Animalia; phylum, Arthropoda; class, Insecta (Hexapoda); order, Diptera; family, Muscidae; genus,  ; species,   Each of these groups is often divided even further into subgroups (subphylum, subclass, suborder, and so on). Insects appeared on Earth long before the advent of humans or the earliest mammals. The first insects probably evolved from primitive ringed worms. These insect ancestors were wingless and developed without metamorphosis, as do today’s silverfish. The oldest fossils of ancestral insect forms are believed to be some 350 million years old. There are also fossil records, from later eras, of highly developed forms very similar to the mayflies, cockroaches, and dragonflies now in existence. Some ancient insects were truly huge; dragonflies, for example, had a wingspread of 2 feet (0.61 meter) or more. Insects that attack humans or anything of value to humans are termed pests; many of these are mutually competitive with humans for the world’s food supply. Other insects are benefactors of humans, as they devour the carcasses of dead animals, pollinate orchards, manufacture honey, or simply serve as another link in the food chain of the animal kingdom, for humans eat the animals—including fish and birds—which, in turn, live upon the insects. 

About 10,000 species of insects have been classified as pests. Some are disease carriers, afflicting and often killing humans. Many insects prey upon domestic animals; others eat human food, clothing, and other possessions. Still others, in their quest for food or lodging, destroy trees, wood, and paper. 

As vectors, or transmitting agents, of disease organisms, insects have caused more deaths and have inflicted greater misery and hardship on humankind than all the wars of history. In their efforts to find food, insects wage their own war against the human race. Some feed upon humans directly. Notable among these are the true flies, including mosquitoes, horseflies, black flies, tsetse flies, and other two-winged pests. 

Perhaps humankind’s worst enemy among the insects is the mosquito. More lives have been lost as a result of malaria, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other mosquito-borne diseases than from all the other insect-borne diseases combined. The tsetse fly has been a serious deterrent to the development of much of tropical Africa, for the insect acts as a vector of trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness) among humans and of nagana, a serious disease of livestock. Horseflies and stable flies also transmit disease through their bites. The common housefly is not a biter, but it can carry myriad disease organisms on the hairs and the sticky secretions of its body. The assassin, or kissing, bug transmits the highly fatal Chagas’ disease. Bedbugs, fleas, and lice live on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. The human louse lives on the blood of humans alone and transmits typhus, relapsing fever, and trench fever.     The flea is potentially one of humankind’s deadliest enemies; rat fleas, for example, carry the germs of murine typhus and  , which wiped out about one-third of the population of Europe in four years in the mid-1300s.  

Insect pests in the home are most commonly chewers. One of the most troublesome of these—the clothes moth—attacks furs, woolens, and materials made of hair. The silverfish and the firebrat eat sized or stiffened material, such as the paper and bindings of books and starched clothing and curtains. In some parts of the United States, termites do considerable damage to furniture and paper products, as well as to the timber frameworks of buildings. 

Most insects are herbivorous—that is, they feed on plants. Virtually every part of a plant, from the flower to the root, is vulnerable to their attack. They do their damage in a variety of ways. Insects with chewing mouthparts are the most destructive plant eaters. A horde of grasshoppers, for example, can strip every blade of vegetation from a field in a few hours. The destruction caused by other chewing insects, such as beetles, can also be enormous. Insects with sucking mouthparts, though usually smaller and less conspicuous than the chewers, also do a great deal of damage to farm crops and to forest and garden plants. These insects pierce plant tissues and draw out the vital juices. These insects include the aphids, chinch bugs, cicadas, and scale insects. Damage is also done to the host plant from within by many other plant pests—usually as larvae. Some eat their way between the top and bottom layers of a leaf, giving it a blotched appearance. The leaf roller, the larval form of certain moths, rolls a leaf into a tube and spins silk to hold it together. The caterpillar then feeds on the leaf. Other insect pests tie several leaves together into a large nest. Gallflies cause swellings on buds, flowers, leaves, stems, bark, or roots of plants. Usually the female pierces the plant and lays an egg; the plant then grows a gall, or swelling, around the egg (   ). As long as a region is left in its natural state, no species of insect is likely to increase disproportionately in numbers. The balance of nature prevents this from happening. Every insect has natural enemies, such as the spider, the praying mantis, and many kinds of disease organisms, that help keep the number of insects down. The balance of nature in the New World was upset when settlers from Europe brought their domestic plants with them. Many insects that were harbored by these plants escaped the natural controls that were present in their old environments and became pests. The widespread use of such insecticides as DDT, now largely discontinued, also disrupted the balance of nature in some areas. Pests arrive in many ways and from many lands. The gypsy moth, for example, was brought to the United States for experiments in the 1860s. It escaped from the laboratory and before the end of the 19th century had cost millions of dollars annually in damage to shade trees. The Argentine ant, an enemy of field crops and stored foods, was a stowaway in a cargo that reached New Orleans, La., in 1891. The brown-tail moth, another shade-tree pest, reached New England from Europe in about 1897. The alfalfa weevil came to Utah in 1902 in soil adhering to imported plants. The corn borer was carried from southern Europe in 1909 in a shipment of broomcorn. Two serious pests came from Japan—the Oriental fruit moth, on cherry trees presented by the city of Tokyo to Washington, D.C., in 1913; and the Japanese beetle, on trees reaching New Jersey in 1916. Also in 1916, carloads of cottonseed from Mexico brought in the pink bollworm. Four arrived in 1920: the satin moth, an enemy of shade trees; the Asiatic beetle, which destroys lawns; the Mexican bean beetle, which feeds on a variety of beans; and the Mediterranean fruit fly, which is highly destructive of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Until the middle of the 19th century Americans were helpless against the growing insect menace. Finally, in the 1860s, arsenic compounds were found to be effective in combating the Colorado potato beetle. This was the first successful control of insect pests by scientific means. In the Morrill Act, in 1862, Congress provided for the study of insect pests and other agricultural problems. Six principal methods are used in the control of insect pests. These methods are chemical, mechanical, radiological, cultural, biological, and legal. The chemical substances used to destroy insects are called insecticides. These may be broadly classified as stomach poisons, contact poisons, fumigants, and sorptive dusts. The stomach poisons are more effective against the chewing insects; the contact poisons, against sucking insects. Fumigants are gaseous poisons that enter the insect’s breathing system. Sorptive dusts are dry chemical compounds that kill insects by absorbing fatty substances from the exoskeleton, thus causing vital body fluids to evaporate. Mechanical methods of insect control—often primitive and time-consuming—are generally less effective than chemical methods. They can seldom be applied practically to large populations of insects or over wide areas. These methods include swatting, the use of traps and barriers, water control, and temperature control. Water control involves adjustment of the water level or the rate of flow in breeding places. Temperature control is sometimes effective against insects that infest enclosed storage facilities. Reducing the temperature to 40° or 50°  F (4° or 10°  C) will cause most insects to become dormant; raising the temperature to 130°  F (54°  C) for three hours is sufficient to kill almost any insect. Perhaps the most dramatic, wholesale destruction of insects can be accomplished by making them infertile. Sexual sterility in male insects is induced by treating them with the rays of radioactive cobalt. If a large number of a particular species undergo this process in the laboratory, the treated males—though sterile—will still mate with fertile females; but the eggs laid by these females will be sterile. Following continual releases of sterile males in a single area, the number of young can be gradually reduced over a period of several generations until the population of the insect is totally wiped out within that area. Through this technique the screwfly, a serious pest of cattle, was first eradicated from the island of Curaçao in the West Indies in 1954. Radiological warfare was then used to bring the screwfly under control in the southeastern United States. The cultural control of insect pests is of special interest to the farmer. Methods include the destruction of plant residues and weeds, crop tillage, crop rotation, and the growing of insect-resistant strains of crops. When the farmer destroys the crop residues and weeds, he also destroys hibernating insects that would otherwise reproduce the following season. By plowing or cultivating at the right time of year, he can often eliminate large numbers of harmful insects living in the soil. Crop rotation is an important means of combating insect pests of field crops, for many such pests will feed on only a single species or a single family of plant. Thus, if a farmer grows a grain one season and a legume the next, populations of many grain pests (as well as legume pests) can be kept down or eliminated. Insect-resistant strains of many crops have been developed. Many of these strains have been developed by means of   techniques. Resistance to the European corn borer, the wireworm, and the chinch bug, for example, has been obtained in a single   hybrid through selective breeding. The control of insects by biological means involves the application of the pest’s natural enemies. These enemies may be microbes, mites, or other insects. Scientists have succeeded in controlling harmful insects by first determining the major predators or parasites of that insect in its country of origin. Then the scientists introduced these natural enemies as control agents in the new country that the pest had infested. A classic example is the cottony cushion scale, which threatened the survival of the California citrus industry in 1886. The predatory ladybird beetle, or vedalia beetle, was introduced from Australia, and within two years the scale insect had virtually disappeared from California. In eastern Canada in the early 1940s the vicious European spruce sawfly was completely controlled by the spontaneous appearance of a viral plant disease, perhaps unknowingly introduced from Europe. This event led to increased interest in plant diseases as potential means of pest control. The legal control of insects concerns government regulations to prevent the spread of insect pests from one country or region to another. The Federal Plant Quarantine Act of 1912 began the fight against imported pests by providing for inspectors at ports of entry. These officials examine all plant products as well as passengers’ baggage. Infested material is destroyed or thoroughly fumigated. Aircraft are examined and may be fumigated as soon as they arrive in the United States from countries where insect pests are a potential threat. By the time an immigrant pest is discovered in domestic plants, it is usually too late for eradication of the injurious insect. In some instances, however, control has been achieved. In 1929 the Mediterranean fruit fly was detected in Florida orchards; the insects threatened ruin to the fruit crop. State and federal entomologists united for battle, and all Florida was quarantined. Abandoned and rundown orchards were destroyed. Chemists developed new poison sprays. By the end of the summer not a “medfly” could be found in Florida. In 1956 a second such outbreak occurred; this too was put down after several months of intensive warfare. In 1981 a serious spread of the medfly threatened California’s agricultural regions with economic disaster. The pest had been imported accidentally in 1980. An attempt to control the insects by importing sterilized males from Peru failed. The Department of Agriculture threatened to quarantine the state’s produce unless the infected areas were fumigated. Governor Jerry Brown finally authorized helicopter spraying of the pesticide called malathion in July 1981. The spraying halted the threat to the California crops. (   .) 

Numerous species of plants depend upon insects to   them. In visiting   for nectar, insects carry pollen from one flower to the pistil of another. In this way they fertilize the plant and enable it to make seeds. Without insects there would be no orchard fruits or berries. Tomatoes, peas, onions, cabbages, and many other vegetables would not exist. There would be no clover or alfalfa. The animals that need these forage crops would be of poor quality, and humankind’s meat supply would suffer. There would be no linen or cotton; no tea, coffee, or chocolate. The honeybee produces honey and wax. Silk is made by the silkworm larva. Shellac is secreted by an Oriental scale insect. Such insects as the dobsonfly are used in sport fishing as bait. In many underdeveloped areas of the world grasshoppers, caterpillars, and other insects are necessary to humans as food. Insects are also important to humans as food for other animals. Freshwater fishes depend upon insects for food. Hundreds of species of birds would perish if there were no insects to eat. Insects have also played a significant role in the biological laboratory. The   fly, in particular, has been valuable in the study of inherited characteristics (   ). The European blister beetle, or Spanish fly, is helpful in the fight against human disease, for it secretes cantharidin, a substance used medically as a blistering agent. Many insects are invaluable as predators on insects that are pests to humans. In the same way, plant-eating insects are often valuable for their destruction of weeds. Insects that burrow in the earth improve the physical and chemical condition of the soil. As scavengers, insects perform the important function of eating dead plants and animals. The housefly, scorned as a disease carrier, is beneficial in its larval form—the maggot. It feeds on decaying refuse and in this way makes the world somewhat cleaner and more habitable for others.

(baptized Feb. 12, 1637, Amsterdam—died Feb. 15, 1680, Amsterdam) was a Dutch naturalist, considered the most accurate of classical microscopists, who was the first to observe and describe red blood cells (1658). Swammerdam completed medical studies in 1667 but never practiced medicine, devoting himself to microscopical investigations instead. Turning to the study of insects, he accurately described and illustrated the life histories and   of many species. His observations of their development led him to separate insects into four major divisions, according to the degree and type of  . Three of these divisions have been more or less retained in modern classification. During the period he devoted to exhaustive entomological research (1667–73), he completed   popularly recognized as a major work at the time, and the   one of the finest collections of microscopical observations ever published. In these works he corrected the physiologist     of the   brain and   and opposed the physician   inconsistent interpretation of insect  . He also demonstrated the presence of   wings in caterpillars about to undergo pupation. Studying the anatomy of the tadpole and the adult frog, he noted a cleavage in the egg and discovered valves in the lymphatic vessels, now known as  Swammerdam valves. He described the ovarian follicles of mammals in the same year as the physician   (1672) and devised improved techniques for injecting wax and dyes into cadavers, which had important consequences for the study of human anatomy. His ingenious experiments showed that muscles alter in shape but not in size during contraction, contradicting the classic Greek physician   popular theory that a material fluid passing through the nerves is responsible for the movement. After his father refused to continue his financial support, Swammerdam suffered extreme privations. Subject in the last years of his life to fits of depression, he sought relief by becoming a   of the religious enthusiast  .

When early man hunted animals and foraged for food, he shared the natural resources with other organisms in the  . As human   developed and population rose, people made ever-increasing demands on these resources. One result of changing the   has been a great increase in the number of species that are now recognized as competitors of humans. These competitors are usually referred to as pests. The definition of pest is, of course, subjective. An   would not necessarily consider several leaf-eating   on a plant as pests, whereas a gardener who   the plant might very well do so. And only one  ,  , or   is enough to qualify as a household pest. Natural   have always contained organisms that were economically significant; locusts, for example, have plagued humans throughout history, and grain from   locations has been found infected with   and   diseases. Most species that became pests, however, did so because of environmental modification, occasionally from natural causes but usually from human activities. In order to appreciate some of the methods devised to combat pests, one should consider how advancing   has increased the number of harmful   species. The change from natural vegetation to large areas of single-crop ( )   has three consequences. First, given a more uniform food source, some plant-eating species increase to large populations. Second, the uniform plant cover is easily invaded by attacking pests. Third, the introduction of new crops over large areas results in the transfer of previously harmless insects from scattered native plants to the new and abundant sources of food. Cultural practices such as fertilization,  , and the use of modern harvesting equipment (which often leaves large amounts of plant litter in the field)   still further the ability of pest species to increase rapidly. In addition, the elimination of species that compete with or prey upon pests—an unintended effect in some pest control programs—has also   certain pest problems. Also, the ease with which people and goods can be transported around the world has resulted in the introduction of exotic pests in many places. Pests are found throughout the   kingdom. Microorganisms such as fungi,  , and viruses are here considered with the pests even though they are usually thought of as agents of  . Most animal pests are invertebrates, among them protozoa, flatworms, nematodes, snails, slugs, insects, and mites. Among the vertebrates, rabbits, elk, deer, and many kinds of rodents are sometimes injurious to crops. Insects are also serious pests, especially those involved with the   of disease. Each year millions of lives, particularly in the tropics, are threatened by insect-borne diseases. Malaria and   are transmitted by mosquitoes,   by fleas, typhus by the  ,   by tsetse flies,   by blood-sucking bugs, and leishmaniasis by sandflies. Other diseases may be spread by insects accidentally as a result of their habits. The  , a pest responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of   in  , arrived in the   in the 1990s, probably embedded in shipping materials from eastern Asia. Pest control began to receive attention in the 18th century, and it has become increasingly important since then. As control programs were developed, they tended to fall primarily into two somewhat mutually   categories: chemical and biological. Physical or mechanical methods, including sticky barriers, heat killing (for storage pests), and flooding (for ground pests), were also developed. Because of their limited utility and short-term effectiveness, they have been superseded largely by chemical and biological methods. The chemical, or  , approach probably began with the use of poisonous plant  —ground tobacco was used in France to kill aphids about 1763. Other natural products such as nicotine, rotenone, petroleum, kerosene, creosote, and turpentine were used in the 19th century. Inorganic compounds such as Paris green, lime sulfur, Bordeaux mixture,  , and lead arsenate were also introduced in the 1800s. With the appearance of the   organic compounds during  , a dramatic change occurred in pest control. Some organic compounds, such as the dinitrophenols, had been used earlier, but the discovery of the insecticidal properties of   (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) and of BHC ( ) made the concept of pest-free crops possible. Research in the 1930s on plant hormones and related compounds led to the development of the selective   2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), and this became commercially available about the same time as DDT. Following the appearance of these new synthetic organic compounds, a whole new series of pesticides—insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and plant growth regulators—was introduced. Although the ancient Chinese used predacious ants to control foliage-feeding insects, the control of pests by biological means appears to have been initiated in the Western world with the importation of the Indian Mynah   into Mauritius in 1762 to control the red locust. Control of bedbugs by predatory agents was recommended in 1776. A number of other projects in   were carried out in the 1800s, but the modern era in this phase of pest control began in 1888 with the importation into California of the vedalia   ( ) to control the   ( ). This beetle, imported from  , saved the citrus-fruit industry. The use of plants resistant to insects was suggested about 1788 as a means of controlling the  , a pest of wheat. The classic example of this approach was the control of phylloxera, aphid-like insects that attacked the root stocks of the European wine grape and almost ruined the European wine industry. The solution lay in grafting the European wine grape onto resistant American stocks. The effort, about 1900, to control the lantana shrub in Hawaii by introducing an insect appears to have been the first attempt to control weeds biologically. The use of microorganisms to destroy insect pests began in the late 1800s and early 1900s. With the appearance of the synthetic organic insecticides, however, emphasis was placed on chemical control, and biological means fell into neglect. The extensive use of powerful chemical agents soon resulted in a number of serious ecological problems. Consequently, current pest control practice minimizes the use of pesticides and combines them with biological methods in an approach called  . The   control of an insect that attacks crops may, for example, involve the   of pest-resistant   varieties; the development of crop   methods that   pest proliferation; the release of organisms that are predators or parasites of the pest species; the placement of traps baited with the pest’s own sex attractants (pheromones); the disruption of the pest’s reproduction by the release of sterilized pests; and, often as a last resort, the application of chemical insecticides. Other important tools of modern pest control or importation and quarantine regulations, which are designed to prevent the introduction of exotic pests.

Modern principles of other fields— ,  , and  , for example—are   with those of biology in areas such as  , biomedicine, and  . Biology is subdivided into separate branches for convenience of study, though all the subdivisions are interrelated by basic principles. Thus, while it is custom to separate the study of   ( ) from that of   ( ), and the study of the structure of organisms ( ) from that of function ( ), all living things share in common certain biological phenomena—for example, various means of  ,  , and the transmission of genetic material. Biology is often approached on the basis of levels that deal with fundamental units of life. At the level of  , for example, life is regarded as a   of chemical and   transformations that occur among the many chemical   that compose an organism. As a result of the   of increasingly powerful and precise laboratory instruments and techniques, it is possible to understand and define with high precision and accuracy not only the ultimate physiochemical organization (ultrastructure) of the molecules in living matter but also the way living matter reproduces at the molecular level. Especially crucial to those advances was the rise of   in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  is the study of cells—the fundamental units of structure and function in living organisms.   were first observed in the 17th century, when the     was invented. Before that time, the individual organism was studied as a whole in a field known as  organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.   biology deals with groups or populations of organisms that inhabit a given area or region. Included at that level are studies of the roles that specific kinds of plants and animals play in the complex and self-perpetuating interrelationships that exist between the living and the nonliving world, as well as studies of the built-in controls that maintain those relationships naturally. Those broadly based levels— , cells, whole organisms, and populations—may be further subdivided for study, giving rise to specializations such as  ,  , biophysics, biochemistry,  ,  , and  . A field of biology may be especially concerned with the investigation of one kind of living thing—for example, the study of   in  , the study of   in  , or the study of microorganisms in  . The concept of  —that living things maintain a constant internal environment—was first suggested in the 19th century by French physiologist  , who stated that “all the vital mechanisms, varied as they are, have only one object: that of preserving constant the conditions of life.” As originally conceived by Bernard,   applied to the struggle of a single organism to survive. The concept was later extended to include any biological system from the   to the entire  , all the areas of   inhabited by living things. All living organisms, regardless of their uniqueness, have certain biological, chemical, and physical characteristics in common. All, for example, are composed of basic units known as   and of the same chemical substances, which, when analyzed, exhibit noteworthy similarities, even in such   organisms as   and  . Furthermore, since the action of any organism is determined by the manner in which its cells interact and since all cells interact in much the same way, the basic functioning of all organisms is also similar. There is not only unity of basic living substance and functioning but also unity of origin of all living things. According to a theory proposed in 1855 by German pathologist  , “all living cells arise from pre-existing living cells.” That theory appears to be true for all living things at the present time under existing environmental conditions. If, however, life originated on Earth more than once in the past, the fact that all organisms have a sameness of basic structure,  , and function would seem to indicate that only one original type succeeded. A common origin of life would explain why in humans or bacteria—and in all forms of life in between—the same chemical substance, deoxyribonucleic acid ( ), in the form of   accounts for the ability of all living matter to replicate itself exactly and to transmit genetic information from parent to offspring. Furthermore, the mechanisms for that transmittal follow a pattern that is the same in all organisms. Whenever a change in a   (a  ) occurs, there is a change of some kind in the organism that contains the gene. It is this universal phenomenon that gives rise to the differences ( ) in   of organisms from which nature selects for survival those that are best able to   with changing conditions in the  .

As the chief agent   the   (bubonic  ) in the  , they were an essential link in the chain of events that resulted in the death of a quarter of the population of Europe. Fleas are small, wingless insects with a tough cuticle bearing many bristles and frequently combs (ctenidia) of broad, flattened spines. The adult flea varies from about 0.1 to 0.32 cm (0.039 to 0.13 inch) in length and feeds exclusively on the   of   (including humans) and  . With about 2,000 species and subspecies known, the order is still a small one compared with many other groups of insects. However, it is widely distributed with some—such as the   and the  mouse flea—having been carried all over the world by humans. Native species of fleas are found in polar,  , and tropical regions. Infestation by fleas may cause severe   of the   and intense itching. Although many animals acquire partial immunity after constant or repeated attacks, individuals (especially humans) can occasionally become sensitized after exposure and develop  . Species that attack people and livestock include the   ( ), the so-called  human flea ( ), the  dog flea ( ), the  sticktight flea ( ), and the jigger, or chigoe, flea ( ).   may be parasitized by the  European chicken flea ( ) and, in the  , by the  western chicken flea ( ).

The Oriental rat flea ( ) is the most efficient carrier of plague, but other species of fleas (e.g.,  ,  ,  ) can also transmit the disease to people. Although there are occasional cases of   in tropical and some temperate regions, the disease in humans can be controlled by early   and  . Plague ( sylvatic plague) is a widespread disease in hundreds of species of wild rodents throughout the world and is maintained in those populations by fleas that parasitize these  . More than 100 species of fleas are known to be able to be infected by the plague bacillus, and an additional 10 species are   as carriers of the classic type of urban plague. (   .) Fleas, particularly  , are thought to be the principal carriers of murine (endemic)  , a rickettsial disease of humans. As in plague, rats and   are the sources of infection. Fleas are considered important in the maintenance and spread of many locally restricted infections among rodents and other mammals, including   and Russian spring-summer  . Fleas transmit  , a   of  , which is used deliberately to control rabbits in areas where they are severe pests (e.g., in Australia). Fleas are probable carriers of a   of   and serve as the intermediate host of a common   ( ) of dogs and   and occasionally children. If heavily infested, animals can suffer severe damage or be killed by the effects of flea bites and the resultant loss of blood. Fleas are subject to   by external  , internal   worms, and  ,  , and   infections. The female jigger, or chigoe, flea (not to be confused with “chigger,” a larval mite) burrows into the skin of its host, generally on the feet, and lives within a cyst that forms around it.

In 1943 he was appointed director of the Agricultural Research Council Unit of Insect Physiology in Cambridge. He was knighted in 1964. Among Wigglesworth’s most significant discoveries were those concerned with  , particularly the control of form and growth. In insects such as the South American blood-sucking bug   Wigglesworth was able to determine that a crucial   was produced in the neurosecretory cells of its brain, the first experimental demonstration of the function of such cells. He then discovered another hormone that actually prevented the development of adult characteristics in   until the insect had reached the appropriate larval stage. Wigglesworth found that this hormone, which he called the  , was produced in the region of the endocrine gland known as the corpus allatum. He found that he could radically distort the developmental phases of his insect subjects by a selective manipulation of their hormonal levels. Finally, Wigglesworth was thus able to formulate a   theory of insect   involving the selective activation by hormones of the insect’s genetic components, which in turn determine its   and developmental character. Besides making these discoveries, Wigglesworth isolated the properties of various insect enzymes and the mechanism for the hatching of insect eggs.

Aphids can be serious plant pests and may stunt plant growth, produce plant galls, transmit   diseases, and cause the deformation of leaves, buds, and flowers. The life cycle of the aphid is complicated. Wingless females, called stem mothers, reproduce without fertilization (i.e., by  ) throughout the summer. These stem mothers are unique in that they produce living young (viviparity) as opposed to eggs, as occurs in most other insects. Eventually the plant containing the stem mother and her offspring becomes overcrowded. When this occurs, some offspring develop into adults with two pairs of large membranous wings. These winged adults fly to new plants. In late summer both males and females are produced. After they mate, the female lays eggs that survive the winter. In warm climates there may be no need for an overwintering egg stage, and   generations occur. The white woolly-ball appearance of many aphids is the result of wax-gland secretion. Aphids are often controlled by natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, aphidlions, and lacewings. However, when economically or aesthetically damaging numbers are present, they can be controlled by insecticidal soaps, horticultural oils, and other traditional insecticides.  may guard and care for aphids in return for the honeydew (a sweet excretory product) they produce. Ants protect aphids from weather and natural enemies and transfer them from wilted to healthy plants. In this way the ants ensure their source of honeydew, which they use as food. Ants obtain honeydew by stroking, or “milking,” the aphids. Common types of aphids include the following: More than 4,000 species of aphids have been described, some 250 of which are pests of crops and ornamental plants. The life history,  , and agricultural significance of select species are described in the following paragraphs. The   ( ) is yellow-green with dark head and legs. It overwinters as a black egg on its only host, the apple tree. It produces honeydew that supports growth of a  . The  cabbage aphid ( ) is small and gray-green with a powdery, waxy covering. It is found in clusters on the underside of leaves of cabbage, cauliflower,  , and radishes. It overwinters as black eggs in northern regions but has no sexual stage in southern regions. When necessary, it can be controlled with the use of insecticides. The  cooley spruce gall adelgid ( ) causes formation of conelike   about 7 cm (3 inches) long on the tips of   twigs. In midsummer when the   open, adults migrate to Douglas firs to lay eggs. However, the life cycle may proceed on either spruce or  . Control is by spraying with  , removing galls before aphids emerge, and planting spruce and Douglas fir apart from each other. The  corn root aphid ( ) is a serious pest dependent on the cornfield  . During the winter, the ants store aphid eggs in their nests and in the spring carry the newly hatched aphids to weed roots, transferring them to corn roots when possible. The aphid stunts the growth of corn and causes plants to turn yellow and wilt. Corn root aphids also infest other grasses. The  eastern spruce gall adelgid ( ) produces pineapple-shaped galls 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4 to 1 inch) long composed of many cells, each containing about 12 aphid nymphs. The galls open in midsummer, releasing mature aphids that infect the same or another spruce. New galls are green with red or purple lines, whereas old galls are brown. Infested branches often die, but individual trees vary in susceptibility. The eastern spruce   adelgid is best controlled by spraying. The  greenbug ( ) is one of the most destructive pests of wheat, oats, and other small grains. It appears as patches of yellow on the plant and may wipe out an entire field. Pale green adults have a dark green stripe down the back. Each female produces between 50 and 60 young per generation, and there are about 20 generations annually. It is controlled by   and insecticides. The  green peach aphid ( ), also called the spinach aphid, is pale yellow-green with three dark lines on the back. The life cycle involves two hosts. The female reproduces parthenogenetically during summer and produces sexual males and females in autumn. It is a serious pest, transmitting many plant mosaic diseases. The melon, or cotton, aphid ( ) is green to black. In warm climates live young are produced all year, while in cooler areas there is an egg stage. Among the dozens of possible hosts are melon, cotton, and cucumber. It is usually controlled by naturally occurring parasites and predators. The   ( ) has two colour  , pale green and pinkish red. It overwinters on clover and alfalfa, migrating to peas in spring. The yellow bean mosaic   it transmits is often responsible for killing pea plants. Each female produces 50 to 100 young in each of 7 to 20 generations a year. It is controlled by insecticides and weather conditions. It is also susceptible to natural predators such as ladybugs and to parasites such as the acarid  . The pea aphid’s colour, which is determined by variations in genes that produce   pigments, may help it evade predators and parasites. Its ability to produce carotenoids is the result of a process known as  , in which the pea aphid   carotenoid genes from   tens of millions of years ago. Carotenoid production has been linked to energy (ATP; adenosine triphosphate) production in pea aphids. The  potato aphid ( ) begins as black eggs on rose plants, which hatch into pink and green young that feed on rosebuds and leaves. In early spring they migrate to potatoes, which are the summer host. One generation occurs every two to three weeks. It is the carrier of tomato and   mosaic virus diseases that kill vines and blossoms. The   ( ) is large and green with black appendages and pink markings. It is common on its only host, the   rose. Natural predators are ladybird   and aphidlions (lacewing larvae). The  rosy apple aphid ( ) deforms fruit, producing “aphis apples.” Its feeding activity causes leaves to curl about it, providing some protection from insecticide sprays. The life cycle involves plantain plants as alternate hosts from which the aphid returns to the apple tree to deposit eggs in the fall. It also attacks pear, hawthorn, and mountain ash. It is often controlled by natural enemies, chiefly syrphid flies, lady beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. However, at times insecticides may be necessary. The  woolly apple aphid ( ) lives on roots and may stunt or kill apple trees. White cottony masses enclose the young aphids. It is controlled by parasites.   .

Ants occur worldwide but are most numerous, both in numbers and in species, in tropical and subtropical regions. Ants are essential members of the   they inhabit, and some even serve as   that have a disproportionately large effect on their ecological  . Some ants are considered pests to humans, and a number are   in areas outside their native ranges.   . Ants range in size from about 2 to 25 mm (about 0.08 to 1 inch). Their color is usually yellow, brown, red, or black. A few genera (e.g.,   of  ) have a metallic luster. Typically, an ant has a large head and a slender, oval   joined to the  , or midsection, by a small waist. In all ants there are either one or two finlike extensions running across the thin waist  . The antennae are always elbowed. There are two sets of jaws: the outer pair is used for carrying objects such as food and for digging, and the inner pair is used for chewing. Some species, such as the debilitating   ( ), have a powerful sting at the tip of the abdomen. Ants are  , and the colony is a family   of which every ant is an   unit. Apart from the community, any one individual cannot properly function or survive, and the   are completely dependent upon the continuous care of the adults. There are generally three  , or classes, within a colony:  , males, and workers. Male ants play no part in everyday nest activities. They live only for a short time, occur in limited numbers, and are virtual parasites of the colony, which must feed them. The fertile female, the queen, performs only one task: egg laying. The life cycle of the ant has four stages—egg, larva,  , and adult—and typically spans a period of 8 to 10 weeks for worker ants. At certain times of the year, the winged males and virgin queens   into the air, where the queen mates with a single male. During the flight he transfers to her   receptacle all the   she will require for the rest of her life, which may be as long as 15 years. The males die soon afterward, and the fertilized queen establishes a new nest or takes over the current nest. Her wings then drop off, and the bulky wing muscles degenerate, providing nutritive materials from the breakdown of the   tissue. As soon as the wings have fallen, her ovaries become functional, and egg laying begins. In primitive species, the queen leaves the nest and forages for food for the larvae. In more advanced forms, the queen rarely leaves the nest. She feeds so-called nutrition eggs or other food stores within her own body to the first brood. The larvae that survive in the nest develop into dwarf workers, which   outside the nest for food to nourish additional larvae. The essential work in the ant society—such as building the nest, feeding and tending the brood, and defending the nest—is performed by the workers, all of whom are female. The workers can be   morphologically and physiologically as soldiers, outside workers, inside workers, and nest builders. In the division of labor among some ant forms, highly specialized types of   have developed. The   ants, for example, make nests in hollow stems of plants, then bore a circular entrance that remains under constant surveillance by special guards whose heads are modified into pluglike structures that fit the entrance. Each guard is relieved after several hours, and another guard takes its place; entrance guards are useless for other tasks.   repletes are a special type of worker that are fed so much that the size of their abdomens is greatly increased. Unable to walk, they hang as living honey jugs from the ceiling of the nest, to be used as a food source when fresh food is  . Most ants live in nests, which may be located in the ground or under a rock or built aboveground and made of twigs, sand, or gravel. Many subterranean nests are quite extensive, with a multitude of tunnels and specialized chambers.   ( ) are large black ants common in North America that live in old logs and timbers. Some species live in trees or in the hollow stems of weeds. Tailor, or weaver, ants, found in the tropics of Africa (e.g.,  ), make nests of leaves and similar materials held together with silk secreted by the larvae.  , a   of ants that are found worldwide, glues together bits of animal feces for its nest. The widely distributed pharaoh ant ( ), a small yellowish insect, builds its nest either in houses, when found in cool climates, or outdoors, when it occurs in warm climates. The food of ants consists of both plant and animal substances. Many ants are generalists and utilize a wide range of organic substances for food. Worker ants forage daily, and collected food and water is brought to the larvae and mature ants in the nest. They frequently use scent marks, which they place on their pathways, to find their way back to the nest and direct other colony members to a food source. Some ant species are hunters and scavengers. Bullet ants, for example,   for live  ,  , and  , including  , beetles, and  , or their carcasses. Certain species, including those of the genus  , often eat the eggs and larvae of other ants or those of their own species in other nests.   (genus  ) scavenge for dead insects on the scorching sand and salt-pan terrain of the  ; they can tolerate surface temperatures of 60 °C (140 °F) or higher for short periods, making them one of the most heat-tolerant groups of insects known. Some species eat the liquid secretions of plants, either directly or indirectly from the bodies of other insects. Many ants collect   from floral or extrafloral  , and some     and  . A number of ants, known as herder ants (  and others), protect and carefully tend to herds of  , from which the ants collect honeydew (a by-product of digestion secreted by certain aphids). The   ( ,  , and others) store honeydew in the distended abdomens of specialized workers. Some genera ( ) eat the honeydew that has fallen onto the surface of a leaf. The so-called Argentine ant ( ) and many   ( ) also eat honeydew.  ( ,  ) store grass, seeds, or berries in the nest, whereas ants of the genus   of   eat only  , which they   in their nests. The Texas   ( ) is a   that often strips the leaves from plants to provide nourishment for its fungus gardens. The social behavior of ants, along with that of  , is the most complex in the insect world. The group is also extremely  , with any number of foraging, nesting, and social behaviors. Acacia ants ( ) inhabit the bullhorn acacia (or bullhorn wattle;  ). The ants obtain food and shelter, and the acacia depends on the ants for protection from browsing animals, which the ants drive away. Neither member can survive successfully without the other, exemplifying obligative  . Slave-making ants, of which there are many species, have a variety of methods for “enslaving” the ants of other species. The queen of   of Africa, for example, allows herself to be dragged by   ants into their nest. She then bites off the head of the   queen and begins laying her own eggs, which are cared for by the “enslaved”   workers. Workers of the slave-making ant   raid nests of   ants, stealing the latter’s pupae. The pupae are raised by   to serve as slaves, and, because the   pupae become imprinted on the chemical odor of the slave-making ants, as adults the captive ants forage and routinely return to the slave-making ant nest. Some species live in the nests of other species as  . In these species the   larvae are given food and nourishment by the host workers.   is a parasite in the nests of  , the most common ant of northern Africa. , of the subfamily Dorylinae, are nomadic and   for the destruction of plant and animal life in their path. The army ants of tropical America ( ), for example, travel in columns, eating insects and other invertebrates along the way. Periodically, the colony rests for several days while the queen lays her eggs. As the colony travels, the growing larvae are carried along by the workers. Habits of the   ( ) are similar.

It was accidentally introduced into the   from   about 1916, probably as   in the soil around imported plants. Japanese beetles are known to feed on more than 200 species of plants, including a wide variety of trees, shrubs, grasses, and nursery plants. They are   insects, often feeding in large groups upon a single tree. A swarm of Japanese beetles can denude a   tree in 15 minutes, leaving nothing but bare branches and the fruit pits. Female beetles burrow from 25 to 100 mm (1 to 4 inches) below the surface of the soil to deposit their eggs, which hatch in about 14 days. The larvae live the entire winter below the surface of the ground in this stage, feeding on the tender roots of plants. During May the larvae transform to prepupa and then to pupa stages, the adult beetles   in June or July. The beetles range from Maine to  , and infestations have been noted in other parts of  . The adult  , about 10 mm (0.4 inch) long, is bright metallic green in colour with coppery-brown wing covers (elytra), five patches of white spots on each side, and two prominent white tufts on top of the exposed tip of the abdomen. Unlike the larva, the adult feeds on the flowers, fruit, and foliage of the plant. Efforts are being made to control the spread of this pest. Poisonous sprays control the adult beetles but differ in the length of their protection against reinfestation. Several of the beetle’s natural enemies—species of parasitic wasps and flies that in Japan were found to prey on the larvae—have been imported into the United States, where some of them have become established. Of even greater promise as a   is a disease-inducing bacterium,   which causes milky disease in larvae; its use has reduced Japanese beetle infestations in some areas.

Used in this sense, the term   commonly includes the primitive insects of the following groups:  , collembolans ( ),  , and   in the orders Zygentoma,  , and Monura (formerly the  ). The taxonomic status of the various groups that are considered apterygotes, however, remains unsettled. A typical apterygote, for example, is wingless and has six legs. The presence of six legs was once an important feature in the identification of true insects and enabled the identification of the apterygotes, including the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans and the now   Thysanura—the four groups that together made up the traditional subclass Apterygota (class Insecta). However, the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans are now considered by some entomologists to be offshoots from the main insectan stem of   and have been given independent taxonomic status as classes equivalent to the class  . The term  , therefore, is sometimes applied only to those groups thought to be ancestors of pterygotes—i.e., the  , fishmoths, and   (order Zygentoma) and the   (order Archaeognatha), together with the extinct   (order Monura). For completeness of discussion, however, and because of the similarities of these primitive hexapods, the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans, as well as orders Zygentoma, Archaeognatha, and Monura, are included in this article.  are minute (to 2 mm [0.08 inch] in length), elongated, and white and lack antennae. Distributed throughout the world in soil and leaf litter, they number about 800 species.   are   in form, coloration, and habitat. Most species are less than 3 mm (0.1 inch) in length, but some range to 10 mm (0.4 inch). They have either elongated or globular bodies with antennae and may have a furcula (ventral abdominal springing organ). Collembolans occur in   and leaf litter throughout the world, including  . There are more than 8,200 known species.   are white or yellowish, blind, elongated with long antennae, and less than 10 mm in length, although one group attains 50 mm (2 inches). Their two tail filaments (or threadlike structures) can be long and thin, short and thick, or in the form of pincers. Diplurans are widely distributed in soil, leaf litter, and rotting logs. More than 800 species have been described. Zygentoma and Archaeognatha are mainly long with three elongated tail filaments. Mostly 5 to 20 mm (0.2 to 0.8 inch) in length when fully grown, these insects are widely distributed in leaf litter, although some live in   and   nests. Zygentoma have small   eyes and styli (i.e., bristlelike processes) only on the  . Archaeognatha have large compound eyes and styli on the legs and abdomen. More than 350 species of Zygentoma and Archaeognatha are known. The largest of the extinct Monura were about 30 mm (1.2 inches) in length. The immature stages in all apterygotes are called  . The young are similar to adults, changing little (slight  ) from molt to molt until sexual maturity is attained. In some groups, molting may continue throughout adult life. The greatest changes occur in the Protura, which is the only anamorphic hexapod group (i.e., an increase in number of body segments occurs at time of molting). The complete number of segments is present only after the third molt. There are at least six stages between molts (instars), and the last is the adult. Little is known about the postembryonic development of Diplura. Most species feed on both living and dead vegetable matter and  , although one group preys on other small  . The   of the Collembola are diverse. Females may lay up to 800 eggs that hatch in 2 to 40 days. Three to 12 juvenile molts occur in intervals ranging from 11 days to a year, with up to 50 molts occurring in a lifetime, which can last from 4 to 18 months. Most Collembola feed on living or decaying   material as well as on fungi,  , and  , while a few feed on carrion or are predatory. In Zygentoma there may be more than 40 molts, although the adult stage is usually reached after about 12 molts. The   ( ) reaches sexual maturity in two or three years and molts multiple times in each   year (sometimes molting more than two dozen times in a single year). They can live as long as seven years. In Archaeognatha there are six instars including adults. Both Zygentoma and Archaeognatha feed on decaying or dried vegetable material. Domestic silverfish eat plant and   remains,  , and artificial  .  in apterygote groups is mainly sexual, but   (reproduction without  ) can occur. Males deposit   packets, often haphazardly, that are taken up by females and stored until the time for fertilization. In proturans small external genitalia of unusual form surround the gonopore in both sexes. Collembolans lack external genitalia, but the gonopore and surrounding area differ. In diplurans external genitalia are absent or vestigial. Zygentoma and Archaeognatha have external genitalia similar to those of the pterygotes. However, the   in males is used to deposit sperm drops and not as a copulative organ. The   and pickup of sperm drops in Zygentoma and Archaeognatha must take place during each adult stage if young are to be produced since the contents of the female sperm receptacle are lost with each molt.

Content: The   came to national prominence in the United States during the mid-1950s and continued to challenge racial segregation and discrimination through the 1960s. Many organizations, notably the  , headed by  , the  , and the  , arranged nonviolent demonstrations to call attention to specific inequalities experienced by Black people, while individuals also challenged unjust laws independently. The civil rights movement eventually achieved equal rights legislation, but not without challenges. In the late 1960s complications arose as various groups confronted the enduring economic and social consequences of past oppression. These problems persisted in subsequent decades, and the idea of real equality remained elusive well into the 21st century. Nonetheless, the intrepid supporters of the civil rights movement took some of the hardest first steps toward equality. On May 17, 1954, the   ruled in the case   that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. The decision effectively overturned the “separate but equal” ruling of   (1896), which had allowed   that mandated separate public facilities for white and Black Americans to prevail throughout the South during the first half of the 20th century. While the   ruling applied only to schools, it implied that segregation in other public facilities was unconstitutional as well. On December 1, 1955, African American civil rights activist   refused to give up her seat on a public bus to a white passenger. Her subsequent arrest initiated a sustained bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. The protest began on December 5, led by  , then a young local pastor, and was so successful that it was extended indefinitely. In the ensuing months, protestors faced threats, arrests, and termination from their jobs. Nonetheless, the boycott continued for more than a year. Finally, the   upheld a lower court’s ruling that segregated seating was unconstitutional, and the federal decision went into effect on December 20, 1956. In September 1957 nine African American students attended their first day at Little Rock Central High School, whose entire student population had until that point been white. The  , as they came to be called, encountered a large white mob and soldiers from the Arkansas National Guard, sent by Arkansas Gov.  , blocking the entrance of the school. For the next 18 days Pres.  , Gov. Faubus, and Little Rock’s mayor, Woodrow Mann, discussed the situation. The Little Rock Nine returned on September 23, but were met with violence. The students were sent home and returned on September 25, protected by U.S. soldiers. Although the students were continually harassed, eight of the nine completed the academic year. The entire confrontation drew international attention not only to civil rights in the United States but also to the struggle between federal and state power. On February 1, 1960, a group of four African American students from the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina (now North Carolina A&T State University), a historically Black college, began a sit-in movement in downtown Greensboro. After making purchases at the F.W. Woolworth department store, they sat at the “whites only” lunch counter. They were refused service and eventually asked to leave. The  , as they came to be called, however, remained seated until closing and returned the next day with about 20 other Black students. The sit-in grew in the following weeks with protestors taking every seat in the establishment and spilling out of the store. As protestors were arrested, others would take their places so that the establishment was unceasingly occupied. The protest spread to other cities, including Atlanta and Nashville. After months of protests, facilities began to desegregate throughout the country, and the Greensboro Woolworth’s started to serve African American patrons in July. On November 14, 1960, six-year-old   was escorted to her first day at the previously all-white William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans by four armed federal marshals. They were met with angry mobs shouting their disapproval, and, throughout the day, parents marched in to remove their children from the school as a protest to desegregation. Every subsequent day of that academic year Bridges was escorted to school, enduring insults and threats on her way, and then learning her lessons from her young teacher, Barbara Henry, in an otherwise empty classroom. Her bravery later inspired the Norman Rockwell painting   (1964). The   began on May 4, 1961, with a group of seven African Americans and six white people who boarded two buses bound for New Orleans. Testing the  ’s ruling on the case   v.   (1960), which extended an earlier ruling banning segregated interstate bus travel (1946) to include bus terminals and restrooms, the Freedom Riders used facilities for the opposite race as their buses made stops along the way. The group was confronted by violence in South Carolina, and, on May 14, when one bus stopped to change a slashed tire, the vehicle was firebombed and the Freedom Riders were beaten. Unable to travel farther, the original riders were replaced by a second group of 10, partly organized by the  , originating in Nashville. As riders were either arrested or beaten, more groups of Freedom Riders would take their place. On May 29 U.S. Attorney General   ordered the   to enforce bans on segregation more strictly, an edict that took effect in September. In the spring of 1963,  , and the   launched a campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, with local Pastor   and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) to undermine the city’s system of racial segregation. The campaign began on April 3, 1963, with  , economic boycotts, mass protests, and marches on City Hall. The demonstrations faced challenges from many sides, including an indifferent African American community, adversarial white and Black leaders, and a hostile commissioner of public safety, Eugene (“Bull”) Connor. On April 12 King was arrested for violating an anti-protest injunction and placed in solitary confinement. The demonstrations continued, but, after a month without any concessions, King was convinced to launch the Children’s Crusade. Beginning on May 2, 1963, school-aged volunteers skipped school and began to march. Many submitted politely to arrests, and local jails quickly filled up. On May 3 Connor ordered the police and fire department to set high-pressure water hoses and attack dogs on protesters. The violent tactics against peaceful demonstrators continued in ensuing days, causing outrage in the community, and gaining national attention. The negative media spurred Pres.   to propose a civil rights bill on June 11. Although the Birmingham campaign eventually negotiated an agreement with local reforms, tensions remained high in the city, and the meeting places of civil rights activists were continually threatened. A bomb on September 15 at   killed four African American girls and injured 14 others. The demonstrations of 1963 culminated with the   for Jobs and Freedom on August 28 to protest civil rights abuses and employment discrimination. A crowd of about 250,000 individuals gathered peacefully on the   in Washington, D.C., to listen to speeches by civil rights leaders, notably  . He addressed the crowd with an eloquent and uplifting message that famously became known as the “ ” speech. On July 2, 1964, Pres.  , signed the   into law, a stronger version of what his predecessor, President  , had proposed the previous summer before his   in November 1963. The act authorized the federal government to prevent racial discrimination in employment, voting, and the use of public facilities. Although controversial, the legislation was a victory for the civil rights movement. On February 21, 1965, the prominent Black leader   was assassinated while lecturing at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem, New York. An eloquent orator, Malcolm X spoke out on the civil rights movement, demanding it move beyond civil rights to human rights, and argued that the solution to racial problems was in orthodox Islam. His speeches and ideas contributed to the development of   ideology and the  . On March 7, 1965,  , organized a march from Selma, Alabama, to the state’s capital, Montgomery, to call for a federal voting rights law that would provide legal support for disenfranchised African Americans in the South. State troopers, however, sent marchers back with violence and tear gas, and television cameras recorded the incident. On March 9 King tried again, leading more than 2,000 marchers to the Pettus Bridge, where they encountered a barricade of state troopers. King led his followers to kneel in prayer and then he unexpectedly turned back. The media attention prompted President   to introduce voting rights legislation on March 15, and on March 21  ; this time, they were protected by Alabama National Guardsmen, federal marshals, and FBI agents. Marchers arrived in Montgomery on March 25, where King addressed the crowd with what would be called his “How Long, Not Long” speech. The   was signed into law several months later, on August 6. It suspended literacy tests, provided for federal approval of proposed changes to voting laws or procedures, and directed the attorney general of the United States to challenge the use of poll taxes for state and local elections. A series of violent confrontations between the city police and residents of Watts and other predominantly African American neighborhoods of Los Angeles began on August 11, 1965, after a white police officer arrested a Black man, Marquette Frye, on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Later accounts indicated that Frye resisted arrest but were unclear whether police had used excessive force. Violence, fires, and looting broke out over the next six days. The   resulted in 34 deaths, more than 1,000 injuries, and $40 million in property damage. The McCone Commission later investigated the causes of the riots and concluded that they were not the work of gangs or the Black Muslim movement, as the media had previously suggested. The violence was more directly a reaction to the great economic challenges that African Americans in urban centers faced: poor housing, schools, and job prospects that civil rights legislation had not improved. In the wake of the assassination of   and urban uprisings,   and   founded the   in Oakland, California, to protect African American neighborhoods from  . The   launched numerous community programs that offered such services as tuberculosis testing, legal aid, transportation assistance, and free shoes to disadvantaged people. The programs confronted the economic problems of African Americans, which the party argued the civil rights reforms did not do enough to address. The Black Panthers’ socialist viewpoint, however, made them a target of the  ’s counterintelligence program ( ), which accused them of being a communist organization and an enemy of the U.S. government. A campaign to annihilate the group came to a head in December 1969 with a police shoot-out at the group’s Southern California headquarters and the killing of   and another Panther during an Illinois state police raid. The Black Panther Party’s operations, however, continued into the 1970s, albeit less actively. On June 12, 1967, the   declared the Virginia statutes prohibiting interracial marriage unconstitutional in the case  . The case was decided nine years after Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Jeter, a woman of mixed African American and Native American ancestry, had pleaded guilty to having violated Virginia state law prohibiting a white person and a “colored” person from leaving the state to be married and returning to live as man and wife. Their one-year prison sentence was suspended on the condition that the couple leave Virginia and not return as husband and wife for 25 years. Once settled in Washington, D.C., the couple filed suit in a Virginia state court in 1963. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which reversed their conviction. Chief Justice   wrote for a unanimous court that the freedom to marry was a basic civil right and that to deny that freedom based on the groundless classifications outlined in Virginia state’s law was “to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law.” The ruling thus invalidated laws against interracial marriage in Virginia and 15 other states. A series of violent confrontations between residents of predominantly Black neighborhoods and city police in Detroit began on July 23, 1967, after a raid at an illegal drinking club where police arrested everyone inside, including 82 African Americans. Nearby residents protested, and some began to vandalize property, loot businesses, and start fires for the next five days. The   spread to other parts of the city and resulted in 43 deaths, hundreds of injuries, more than 7,000 arrests, and 1,000 burned buildings. As the disturbances continued, President   appointed a   (the Kerner Commission) to investigate recent urban uprisings. It concluded that racism, discrimination, and poverty were some of the causes of the violence and warned that “our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.” On April 4, 1968,   by a sniper while standing on the second-floor balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He had been staying at the hotel after leading a nonviolent demonstration in support of striking sanitation workers in that city. His murder set off riots in hundreds of cities across the country, and it also pushed   to pass the stalled   in King’s honor on April 11. The legislation made it unlawful for sellers, landlords, and financial institutions to refuse to rent, sell, or provide financing for a dwelling based on factors other than an individual’s financial resources. After that victory, some of King’s supporters carried on his activities, including staging the Poor People’s March in Washington, D.C., that spring. The civil rights movement, however, seemed to be shifting away from the nonviolent tactics and interracial cooperation that had brought about a number of policy changes. The changes, however, could not overcome deep-seated discrimination and the economic oppression that prevented real equality.

The adult housefly is dull gray with dirty-yellowish areas on the abdomen and longitudinal lines on the  . Body size ranges from about 5 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 inch), and the     eyes have approximately 4,000 facets. Because it has sponging or lapping mouthparts, the housefly cannot bite; a near relative, the  , however, does bite. The housefly can walk on vertical window panes or hang upside down on a ceiling probably because of the surface-tension properties of a secretion produced by tiny glandular pads (pulvilli) beneath each claw on the feet. The female deposits more than 100 slender whitish eggs (0.8 to 1 mm long) at a time, producing between about 600 and 1,000 eggs in her life. These eggs hatch in 12 to 24 hours. After several molts the dirty-whitish   (larvae), about 12 mm long, transform into  .

(Some authorities use the name Hemiptera; others consider both the heteropterans and the homopterans to be suborders of the Hemiptera.) This large group of insects, consisting of more than 40,000 species, can be recognized by an X-shaped design on the back, which is formed by the wings at rest. A combination of features—sucking mouthparts adapted to pierce plant or   tissues and a hardened gula (underside of the head)—separate the heteropterans from all other insect orders. Although most species of Heteroptera are terrestrial, a few are aquatic. Some species, which feed on plant juices, are serious pests of   crops. Other species are predacious and benefit humans by destroying various pests. There also are heteropterans that act as carriers of disease. Heteropterans can be divided into three large groups on the basis of general habitat: the water-dwelling Hydrocorisae ( ,  ,  ,  , and  ); the surface-swimming and shore-dwelling Amphibicorisae ( ,   and  ,  , and  ); and the Geocorisae, a large group of land bugs ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  ). Like any other biologically successful group of organisms, the heteropterans are   and   and have adapted to a variety of habitats. They range in length from more than 100 mm (3.9 inches) to less than 1 mm (0.039 inch) and have invaded habitats from dry land to water. One of the few insect groups with aquatic adults capable of obtaining adequate oxygen from the water, heteropterans include the only insect species that spend their lives on oceans far from land. Some heteropterans are nourished by blood of animals ranging from mites to humans. Others feed from the sap of plants as diverse as giant redwoods and algae. Some suck surface fluids (e.g., nectar), some pierce tissues to suck sap or blood, and others obtain nourishment from dried seeds. Many forms live on open surfaces and escape enemies by running, flying, or remaining inconspicuously motionless. Some seek food and shelter in natural crevices, and others actively burrow into the soil or seek out the nests of animals. Heteropterans are most   in the tropics, decreasing in both individuals and species to limits northward beyond the   and southward almost to the  . Every major landmass harbours different species, and migrations to new habitats may be aided by natural agents (e.g., wind, birds, floating debris) or by humans. Although heteropterans have been carried throughout the world, only a few species have become established in many lands. Unique among insects are some water striders (Gerridae), which are at home on the open ocean between approximately 40° north latitude and 40° south latitude and may not approach land for several generations. More than 40,000 species of heteropterans are known. Most families containing 150 or more species are represented in every  . Two exceptions are the Phymatidae (ambush bugs), with no species known in Australia or the  , and the Plataspidae, with no New World species. Families with the fewest species have the most restricted ranges: Aphylidae, Hyocephalidae, and Lestoniidae are restricted to Australia and contain among them only five species. The Velocipedidae of the Orient and the Vianaididae of the American tropics number four species each. In general, zoogeographic restriction is most evident at the subfamily, tribal, and generic levels. Heteropterans have complex and important roles in the balance of nature. The majority of them occupy an intermediate position in the ecological food chain; they use food producers (plants) and serve as food sources for   and other animals. A few species utilize plant-feeding insects as food. Heteropterans often serve as food for humans and other animals. In some Latin American countries eggs of certain aquatic bugs are collected by providing submerged mats of hollow reeds or straws as egg-laying sites; the eggs are then dried and made into cakes. Chickens, turkeys, hogs, and other domestic stock consume available heteropterans. Aquatic bugs are an important food source for fish. Wild birds and mammals, from the wrens and shrews to the turkey and  , utilize available heteropterans in their diets. Species that attack unwanted plants and feed on the eggs, immature stages, and adults of injurious insects include most assassin bugs,  , anthocorid bugs, stinkbugs, and plant bugs. These heteropterans are used in   of   weeds and injurious insects.

Some     species are gall inquilines, meaning they do not cause the formation of galls but inhabit those made by other insects. The overgrowth of tissue, or gall, presumably is caused by a substance secreted by the immature   living within it. Adults of most of the approximately 600 species of gall wasps that occur in   are about 6 to 8 mm (about 0.25 to 0.30 inch) long and black.

Many of these wasps attack   trees or   plants. Male gall wasps are rare, and reproduction usually occurs by   (i.e., larvae develop from unfertilized eggs). The egg passes through the long ovipositor of the female and into the plant tissue. After the egg hatches into a larva, it begins to secrete materials that cause the plant tissues around it to begin to grow faster than normal. The gall increases in size as the larva grows. The larva feeds on the plant tissue within the gall and pupates and transforms into an adult within the gall.

Aphids can be serious plant pests and may stunt plant growth, produce plant galls, transmit   diseases, and cause the deformation of leaves, buds, and flowers. The life cycle of the aphid is complicated. Wingless females, called stem mothers, reproduce without fertilization (i.e., by  ) throughout the summer. These stem mothers are unique in that they produce living young (viviparity) as opposed to eggs, as occurs in most other insects. Eventually the plant containing the stem mother and her offspring becomes overcrowded. When this occurs, some offspring develop into adults with two pairs of large membranous wings. These winged adults fly to new plants. In late summer both males and females are produced. After they mate, the female lays eggs that survive the winter. In warm climates there may be no need for an overwintering egg stage, and   generations occur. The white woolly-ball appearance of many aphids is the result of wax-gland secretion. Aphids are often controlled by natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, aphidlions, and lacewings. However, when economically or aesthetically damaging numbers are present, they can be controlled by insecticidal soaps, horticultural oils, and other traditional insecticides.  may guard and care for aphids in return for the honeydew (a sweet excretory product) they produce. Ants protect aphids from weather and natural enemies and transfer them from wilted to healthy plants. In this way the ants ensure their source of honeydew, which they use as food. Ants obtain honeydew by stroking, or “milking,” the aphids. Common types of aphids include the following: More than 4,000 species of aphids have been described, some 250 of which are pests of crops and ornamental plants. The life history,  , and agricultural significance of select species are described in the following paragraphs. The   ( ) is yellow-green with dark head and legs. It overwinters as a black egg on its only host, the apple tree. It produces honeydew that supports growth of a  . The  cabbage aphid ( ) is small and gray-green with a powdery, waxy covering. It is found in clusters on the underside of leaves of cabbage, cauliflower,  , and radishes. It overwinters as black eggs in northern regions but has no sexual stage in southern regions. When necessary, it can be controlled with the use of insecticides. The  cooley spruce gall adelgid ( ) causes formation of conelike   about 7 cm (3 inches) long on the tips of   twigs. In midsummer when the   open, adults migrate to Douglas firs to lay eggs. However, the life cycle may proceed on either spruce or  . Control is by spraying with  , removing galls before aphids emerge, and planting spruce and Douglas fir apart from each other. The  corn root aphid ( ) is a serious pest dependent on the cornfield  . During the winter, the ants store aphid eggs in their nests and in the spring carry the newly hatched aphids to weed roots, transferring them to corn roots when possible. The aphid stunts the growth of corn and causes plants to turn yellow and wilt. Corn root aphids also infest other grasses. The  eastern spruce gall adelgid ( ) produces pineapple-shaped galls 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4 to 1 inch) long composed of many cells, each containing about 12 aphid nymphs. The galls open in midsummer, releasing mature aphids that infect the same or another spruce. New galls are green with red or purple lines, whereas old galls are brown. Infested branches often die, but individual trees vary in susceptibility. The eastern spruce   adelgid is best controlled by spraying. The  greenbug ( ) is one of the most destructive pests of wheat, oats, and other small grains. It appears as patches of yellow on the plant and may wipe out an entire field. Pale green adults have a dark green stripe down the back. Each female produces between 50 and 60 young per generation, and there are about 20 generations annually. It is controlled by   and insecticides. The  green peach aphid ( ), also called the spinach aphid, is pale yellow-green with three dark lines on the back. The life cycle involves two hosts. The female reproduces parthenogenetically during summer and produces sexual males and females in autumn. It is a serious pest, transmitting many plant mosaic diseases. The melon, or cotton, aphid ( ) is green to black. In warm climates live young are produced all year, while in cooler areas there is an egg stage. Among the dozens of possible hosts are melon, cotton, and cucumber. It is usually controlled by naturally occurring parasites and predators. The   ( ) has two colour  , pale green and pinkish red. It overwinters on clover and alfalfa, migrating to peas in spring. The yellow bean mosaic   it transmits is often responsible for killing pea plants. Each female produces 50 to 100 young in each of 7 to 20 generations a year. It is controlled by insecticides and weather conditions. It is also susceptible to natural predators such as ladybugs and to parasites such as the acarid  . The pea aphid’s colour, which is determined by variations in genes that produce   pigments, may help it evade predators and parasites. Its ability to produce carotenoids is the result of a process known as  , in which the pea aphid   carotenoid genes from   tens of millions of years ago. Carotenoid production has been linked to energy (ATP; adenosine triphosphate) production in pea aphids. The  potato aphid ( ) begins as black eggs on rose plants, which hatch into pink and green young that feed on rosebuds and leaves. In early spring they migrate to potatoes, which are the summer host. One generation occurs every two to three weeks. It is the carrier of tomato and   mosaic virus diseases that kill vines and blossoms. The   ( ) is large and green with black appendages and pink markings. It is common on its only host, the   rose. Natural predators are ladybird   and aphidlions (lacewing larvae). The  rosy apple aphid ( ) deforms fruit, producing “aphis apples.” Its feeding activity causes leaves to curl about it, providing some protection from insecticide sprays. The life cycle involves plantain plants as alternate hosts from which the aphid returns to the apple tree to deposit eggs in the fall. It also attacks pear, hawthorn, and mountain ash. It is often controlled by natural enemies, chiefly syrphid flies, lady beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. However, at times insecticides may be necessary. The  woolly apple aphid ( ) lives on roots and may stunt or kill apple trees. White cottony masses enclose the young aphids. It is controlled by parasites.   .

The chief structures of the mouth are the  , which tear and grind ingested food into small pieces that are suitable for digestion; the tongue, which positions and mixes food and also carries sensory receptors for taste; and the  , which separates the mouth from the nasal cavity, allowing separate passages for air and for food. All these structures, along with the lips, are involved in the formation of speech sounds by modifying the passage of air through the mouth. The oral cavity and vestibule are entirely lined by   containing numerous small glands that, along with the three pairs of salivary glands, bathe the mouth in fluid, keeping it moist and clear of food and other debris.

Content: From frogs that give birth through their mouths to crabs with 6-foot legs, these animals are some of the strangest you’ll hopefully never have to see. Besides just looking strange, these   are exposed to some pretty extreme environments. Discovered in 2010, the yeti crab ( ) lives in   near   that reach temperatures of up to 720 °F (380 °C). Their white coloring and strange hair patterns are thought to be adaptations to these extreme environments. The thermal vents, while ridiculously hot inside, are surrounded by freezing waters. This forces all the yeti crabs to cram themselves into a small area. (One marine biologist found 600 of these crabs in one vent!) Females, however, must venture into the dangerously cold waters to  , as the thermal vents are too high in   content for the crabs’ eggs to survive. The mother yeti crab rarely survives the cold water, usually dying of starvation after her children hatch. As for those hairy arms, they are a garden of sorts, growing bacteria that the crab then feeds on.  This insect may be only ¼ of an inch long, but do not be deceived: it packs quite a terrifying punch. The   ( ), despite its name, is actually a species of wasp. Because of high levels of  , males have wings but females do not, giving the females an antlike appearance. Velvet ants can be found in the hotter portions of the  . As if the existence of crawling wasps weren’t enough to warrant night terrors, these freakishly fuzzy insects can deliver enough poison in one sting to subdue a  —which weighs about 2,000 pounds, equivalent to 13 average-sized humans. Not only are the adult velvet ants terrifying, but even as   these bugs are nightmarish. When laying eggs, females seek out nests of other ground-dwelling insects. When the eggs hatch, the newborn velvet ants feed on the other insects’ larvae. Yikes! Red-lipped   ( ) are by no means dangerous, but they   clearly a product of an evolutionary nightmare. This aptly named sea creature is found on ocean floors 3–76 meters deep and is known best for its bright red lips and the difficulty it has when swimming. Yes, you read that right—a fish that has difficulty swimming. Its fins serve as “legs,” of sorts, on which the fish walks across the ocean floor. This striking red-lipped   of a fish is actually most likely a male—those red lips are thought to attract mates. I guess everyone has a type.  Okay, this   might not look all that grotesque, but it gives birth  . After the eggs are externally fertilized by a male, the female swallows her eggs. The eggs hatch as tadpoles in her stomach and grow until they become full-size frogs—and then mom regurgitates them up (ew!) over the span of a week. Unfortunately (or fortunately), these frogs went extinct in the 1980s. Scientists, however, are attempting to bring them back to life using a method of   called  , because who doesn’t love the idea of mouth-birthing Frankenstein frogs.  If you haven’t had nightmares about this guy already, you definitely will now. Named the “World’s Ugliest Animal” of 2013, the blobfish ( ) has made quite a splash (or maybe a flop) in the scientific and pop-cultural communities since its discovery in 2003. The blobfish is a gelatinous mass that floats above the ocean floor at depths of 600–1,200 meters. They have bones, but, because of the intense pressure they are exposed to at such depths, the bones are very soft and malleable. Since blobfish lack any substantial muscle, they feed only on   and other edible materials that happen to swim in front of their strange, strange mouths. Although these guys are absolutely ghastly looking on land and in observatories, their low-density flesh has led scientists to the understanding that they aren’t as, well, “blobby” when deep underwater. Their   tendencies may fascinate scientists, but to laypeople the blobfish is just unsettling. Talk about a face only a mother could love.  These massive creatures are absolutely spine-chilling…or, in their case,  -chilling. The   ( ) has a leg span of 10–12 feet. (That’s twice the height of an average human!) Clearly deserving of their name, these   resemble giant underwater spiders (yikes!) and feed on smaller crustaceans as well as plants. Japanese spider crabs were discovered in 1836 and are found mainly in waters surrounding the southern coast of  . They hang out at depths of 150–300 meters and are currently a subject of conservation efforts because of overfishing. They are actually considered a delicacy in many parts of Japan. Can you imagine ordering crab legs and being served one that’s six feet long?  Philippine tarsiers ( ), or really just   in general, are some of the strangest looking   mammals on Earth. With eyes that take up half of their head, tarsiers grow only to be the size of a human fist. Their heads can rotate 180 degrees—an evolutionary trait that surfaced in response to the fixation of their eyes in their head. They have powerful hind legs that allow them to jump up to three feet at a time. As suggested by the size of their optics, they have fantastic night vision—which at times results in their pupils covering the entirety of their eyes. There have been problems involving these fellows being illegally sold as pets. There’s a market for everything—even scary-looking mini-mammals.  At first glance, this   might not seem all that terrifying, but it is a giant  , four feet tall (some have been recorded as reaching five feet tall), that is known to eat turtles, fish, and young crocodiles. The shoebill ( ) has long thin legs as well as a disproportionately large head and bill. It lives in the swamps of eastern   and has been found to   its prey before consuming it. When shoebills have offspring, they focus their attention on only the eldest. Should two eggs hatch, the parents reject the younger hatchling, and in some cases the elder attempts siblicide (killing of a sibling). The younger offspring is theorized to function as a backup in case something happens to the elder. This is thought to be a form of energy conservation, but it seems just plain evil. Look at that nightmarish grin.  These   may appear to be just funny-looking cousins of the terrifying crocs we are more familiar with. However, their disproportionately long jaws are lined with 110 razor-sharp teeth. That’s 30 more than the typical crocodile, and their teeth are much sharper.   ( ) can grow to be 20 feet long and can weigh up to 350 pounds. They are found in   and  , specifically in major northern river systems. Males exhibit a   trait atop the end of their snout called a   (after a type of Indian pottery), from which the crocodile gets its name. These massive creatures don’t attack humans but will feed on corpses set afloat during funeral ceremonies.  We’ll finish this unnerving list with what might be the most underrated nightmare-dwelling animal alive. The star-nosed   ( ) can be found in wet low areas, typically in eastern   and the northeastern  . Its main claim to fame is its strange pink fleshy ring around the snout, called the  . The star is jam-packed with nerve fibers and functions similar to our eyes: it paints a picture of the mole’s surroundings by using its keen sense of touch. The giant claws are used for digging tunnels beneath swamps—the mole’s primary habitat. The star-nosed mole is also considered the fastest eating   on Earth, consuming insects in less than 0.2 second. These guys are pretty interesting, but they still look like hairy aliens.

The world’s most abundant creatures are the insects, whose known species outnumber all the other animals and the plants combined. Insects have been so successful in their fight for life that they are sometimes described as the human race’s closest rivals for domination of the Earth. Entomologists, the scientists who study insects, have named almost 1,000,000 species—perhaps less than one third of the total number. Insects thrive in almost any habitat where life is possible. Some are found only in the Arctic regions, and some live only in deserts. Others thrive only in fresh water or only in brackish water. Many species of insects are able to tolerate both freezing and tropical temperatures. Such hardy species are often found to range widely over the Earth. Few insects, however, inhabit marine environments. Small size, relatively minor food requirements, and rapid reproduction have all aided in perpetuating the many species of insects. Certain parasitic insects spend much of their lives on or within the body of an animal host, where all the comforts of life—food, moisture, warmth, protection from enemies—are optimal. Other kinds of insects spend all or some part of their lives securely enclosed in a food plant. Some species have become remarkably versatile in order to meet the changing demands of the environment. Various water bugs and water beetles are able to fly and swim, as well as crawl. Many types of insects, such as the bees, ants, and wasps depend on a complex social structure and defensive behavior. Nonpredatory species frequently have special defenses, such as an unpleasant taste or odor, venomous spines, or camouflage. Although they are adaptable and versatile as a group, insects are often unable to adjust to unusual weather conditions. Excessive rain, an unusually early frost, an extended drought—these and other weather extremes can quickly wipe out or drastically reduce insect populations in a region. Because insects are an important item in the diet of many other animals—birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, as well as other insects—the number is constantly held in check. The total of all factors unfavorable to insect survival is overwhelming; thus, in some species, out of hundreds of eggs laid by a single female, seldom do more than a few individuals reach adulthood. The survival of some species is enhanced by the large numbers of eggs laid. 


Despite their diversity, all adult insects share some basic external and internal anatomical features. Insects are distinguished from other members of the animal kingdom by having six legs; one pair of antennae; a ringed, or segmented, body; and three well-defined body regions. It is from the joined body rings, or segments, that insects derived their name, for the Latin word   means “segmented.” Many creatures closely resemble insects and are often mistaken for them—for instance, spiders and scorpions, which have eight legs; centipedes, which have dozens of legs; and mites and ticks, which have saclike bodies unbroken by segments. The name bug refers to certain insects with piercing and sucking mouthparts but is also commonly applied to insects in general. 

The three main sections of an insect body are the head; the middle section, or thorax; and the hind section, or abdomen. The body is covered with a horny substance containing chitin. The protective armor plate also serves as an external skeleton, or  , for the support of the internal organs. 

The head bears the antennae, the mouthparts, and the eyes. The thorax has three segments; on each is a pair of legs. In winged insects the thorax also bears one or two pairs of wings. The abdomen typically has 11 segments, though no more than 10 are visible; it contains a large part of the digestive system. In females the ovipositor, or egg-laying organ, is located at the tip of the abdomen. The nervous system of the insect includes a brain and a pair of parallel nerve cords, which extend along the length of the underside of the body. Along the nerve cords are a series of nerve masses, called ganglia. Each ganglion controls certain activities and is more or less independent of the others. Insect blood is usually green, yellow, or colorless. Few insects have red blood. The fluid is not enclosed in a system of arteries, veins, and capillaries but fills the body cavity. It is circulated by a tube that extends down the length of the body along the center of the back. The tube has valved intake openings along its sides and is open at the anterior, or front, end. By means of muscles, it draws the blood through the side openings and pumps it forward into the head cavity and out again into the body. The pulsations of the tube can be easily seen in light-colored caterpillars. Air enters the body through breathing pores, called spiracles. A pair of spiracles is usually found on each of two thoracic segments and on several abdominal segments. From the spiracles, large air tubes called tracheae and smaller ones known as tracheoles carry air to all parts of the body. Some water insects breathe by means of gills. Other aquatic insects have a snorkellike tube that leads to the water’s surface. Certain internal parasites and very primitive insects breathe directly through the body wall. 

Mouthparts vary with feeding habits. For example, the mouth of a chewing insect, such as the grasshopper, has several parts. There is an upper lip, the labrum, and a lower lip, the labium. Between these are two pairs of jaws, which work sideways. The upper jaws, or mandibles, are for crushing; the lower pair, the maxillae, manipulate the food. On the maxillae and on the labium are two pairs of sensory structures called palpi. On the floor of the mouth is the tonguelike hypopharynx, which secretes digestive juices. The sucking type of mouth is a modification of the chewing type. The butterfly’s coiled proboscis, or sucking tube, is a modification of the maxillae. The sense organs of insects are as varied as they are intricate. In some of these creatures the visual organs are capable of nothing more than distinguishing night from day. Others have eyes as efficient and sensitive as those of the vertebrates. 

Insect eyes are of two general types—simple and compound. Simple eyes, also called ocelli, are usually located in small clusters on the sides of the head or on the frons, or forehead. Although small, they may easily be seen by means of a magnifying glass. Ocelli are found in both immature and mature insects, but they appear to be more important in the mature forms. Individually these organs can do no more than detect light; however, the sensations received by several ocelli can together produce in the insect’s brain an image of the surrounding area as the creature turns its head from side to side. Compound eyes, like the sight organs of higher animals, are present in pairs, with one eye on each side of the head. They are most common in adult insects. Some—certain mayflies, for example—have two pairs of compound eyes. The eyes are called compound because each one is composed of many lenslike facets. Each of these facets—of which there are, for example, some 25,000 in a single dragonfly eye—receives a separate image. The total effect of these images is a composite picture in the insect’s brain. The eyes of many insects—bees, for example—are sensitive to ultraviolet light, but insect eyes are generally less sensitive to colors at the red end of the  . The antennae are vital structures, because organs of taste, touch, smell, and hearing may be located in them. The loss of the pair of antennae usually leaves the insect in a shocked and helpless state. Their appearance and structure may vary greatly, even between insects of the same order. The hearing organs of insects are well developed in many species and are found on various parts of the body. The ears of katydids and crickets are located on the tibiae of the forelegs. The typical grasshopper’s ear is clearly visible as an oval plate on the first abdominal segment. Insect sounds are produced by specialized structures to attract the opposite sex, to communicate with other members of a group, or to frighten enemies. Wings or mouthparts may be rubbed together. Legs may be scraped against wings or bodies. The grubs of certain wood-boring beetles produce sound by rubbing their legs together. The male cicada vibrates miniature “drumheads” on the lower surface of its abdomen. The song of the female mosquito comes from the vibration of special bands stretched across its breathing organs. 


The development from egg to adult is most interesting, especially in those insects that go through the complex changes called complete metamorphosis. The growth of insects is quite different from that of vertebrates because the insect skeleton is an external covering rather than an internal framework. Except for the pliable fold between the plates of chitinous cuticle making up the exoskeleton, there is no place where expansion can occur; thus the growing insect must periodically shed, or molt, its covering. The new skin, already formed, then expands and begins to harden. The offspring of all insects undergo a varying number of such growth intervals before maturity. Adult insects do not grow at all. With the exception of the subimago (subadult) stage of the mayfly, only adults have functional wings. Primitive species such as silverfish mature with little change in appearance except their size. These kinds of insects are known as ametabolous insects. The immature insects of such species are called simply the “young.” Immature grasshoppers, cicadas, the true bugs, and a number of other types resemble the adults in many respects but lack functional wings. Such young, called nymphs, are hemimetabolous or are said to exhibit incomplete metamorphosis. A variation of such development occurs in dragonflies, mayflies, and caddis flies. The nymphs of these forms are aquatic and have a way of life quite unlike that of the adults. Bees, beetles, butterflies, and moths are some of the insects that go through all the changes of complete metamorphosis. They are said to be holometabolous. The young are called larvae (singular, larva). In the inactive stage immediately preceding adulthood they are called pupae (singular, pupa). 


The larva hatches from an egg. Often larvae are mistaken for worms. They may be smooth-bodied, like the maggots of the fly, or hairy, like some caterpillars (literally, “hairy cat”), or they may be vicious-looking, like the grub of the tiger beetle. Larvae are classified into five forms, based on their shape: eruciform (caterpillarlike), scarabaeiform (grublike), campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active), elateriform (wirewormlike), and vermiform (maggotlike). Larvae differ from adults in many respects. The mouthparts may be completely different. The mouth is always well developed, for this stage is the hungriest period of the insect’s life. Eyes, if present, are usually simple rather than compound. Certain structures found in the larva may be absent in the adult. Caterpillars, for example, have several additional legs, called prolegs, along the abdomen. 





Near the end of its larval stage, the insect must find a place in which to pupate, or turn into a pupa. Beetle larvae, as well as certain caterpillars, may hollow out cells in the soil. Some caterpillars may spin silken cocoons about their bodies; some may spin bands to hold themselves against twigs or leaves. Some caterpillars hang upside down from silken pads. Hairy caterpillars pluck out their hairs to line the walls of their cocoons.     The pupal stage is a time of tissue transformation. During this period different kinds of mouthparts, legs, eyes, and, perhaps, breathing organs must replace those of the larva. When the changes are completed, the creature bursts out of its old skin to become a fully developed insect. In this final, sexually mature state, it is also known as an imago.   Each species of insect, in its struggle for survival, has developed complex behavior mechanisms and habits. These involve every activity of daily life—including egg laying, nest building, self-defense, and the search for food. Most species of insects are of two sexes, but in some—the white-fringed beetle, for example—males are unknown. In certain insects the sex of the offspring depends upon whether or not the egg has been fertilized. The unmated females of some parasitic wasps produce males only, while mated ones produce the two sexes in about equal numbers. The queen honeybee can lay either fertilized or unfertilized eggs, according to the needs of the hive. Unfertilized eggs produce drones, while fertilized eggs produce females. 

The adult female instinctively places her eggs in a place suitable for their hatching and for proper development of the young. Parasitic wasps and flies place their eggs directly on the host. The horse botfly glues her eggs to the hairs of the horse where they can be licked off and thus be transferred to the horse’s stomach; the larvae live on the lining of the stomach and intestines. If a caterpillar feeds on only one species of plant, then the egg from which it will hatch is unerringly placed upon that plant. 

Often insects’ eggs are hidden in special protective materials. They may be encased in frothy secretions which dry to form a hard covering, or clusters of eggs may be coated with hairs or scales from the adult insect’s body. The eggs of many species are inserted directly into plant tissues by means of sawlike or spearlike ovipositors. 

The young of some insects are born alive. Such insects are called viviparous (from Latin  , “alive,” and  , “bring forth”), to distinguish them from egg-laying insects, which are called oviparous (from Latin  , “egg”). Aphids sometimes lay eggs and sometimes produce live young; female aphids also bear young for many generations without mating. This is called parthenogenesis (from the Greek words meaning “virgin birth”). A few insects reproduce in the larval or pupal stages. This is known as paedogenesis (from the Greek words meaning “birth from young”). 

Nest building as an adult activity is peculiar to ants, wasps, and bees. Carpenter ants live in galleries, which they chew out of tree trunks, logs, and fence posts. Mound-building ants construct cities in the soil, with thousands of chambers and passageways. The great paper apartment houses of the paper wasps and the honeycombs of the bees are considered to be marvels of engineering. 

Nesting species must feed their larvae. Ants forage for food for their young. Some species raise fungus gardens and cultivate aphid “cows,” whose liquid excrement, or honeydew, they eat. The mud dauber wasp lays its eggs in tubes of mud. It then stocks the tubes with paralyzed spiders and seals the tubes. After the larvae hatch, a sufficient food supply is at hand until they pupate. Each species of insect usually passes the winter in one particular phase of development. Some butterflies winter as pupae, caterpillars, or eggs. The monarch butterfly migrates long distances southward in the fall; some survive for a return flight in the spring. In the winter some insects may come out of hibernation during brief periods of mild weather. Snow scorpion flies and springtails are often found on snow or ice. Honeybees in well-protected hives use their body heat to maintain a hive temperature that permits them to remain somewhat active and to feed on stored sweets. They leave the hive when the temperature rises to about 55°  F (13°  C). Extreme heat or drought brings about a period of inactivity called estivation. The eggs of mosquitoes do not hatch and the nymphs and adults of many aquatic insects become dormant when the breeding ponds and marshes dry up. Insects have developed many methods of self-defense to avoid being devoured by their enemies. Flight, concealment, motion, armor and weapons, and even grotesqueness are some of these methods. Certain insects are specially adapted for hiding. Vast numbers hide beneath stones or the bark of trees. The flattened bodies of cockroaches and bedbugs enable them to disappear into narrow cracks. 


The most interesting means of concealment are   and  . The walkingstick looks like a twig. Certain moths blend so well into the bark of the tree on which they rest that they cannot be distinguished from the tree. Some harmless insects resemble stinging species in shape or color and so are avoided by predators. Certain moths and flies mimic bees. Armor and weapons are well developed in many insects. The tough, horny covering of the beetles amounts to a solid shell of armor. Sharp jaws and beaks, poisoned stingers, and spines serve as effective weapons. The extreme hairiness of some caterpillars makes birds and other predators avoid them, and in some caterpillars the hairs have venomous spines. Stink glands in some insects repel attackers in the same way as those in a skunk. When disturbed, the bombardier beetle ejects an irritating gas from its tail. The gas may be fired repeatedly and audibly. Grasshoppers exude a fluid popularly known as “tobacco juice.” The flavor of some insects is so bitter or sour that would-be predators avoid eating them. Insects are not able to reason. They are guided by instinct and by physiological reactions to their environment. Such reactions are called tropisms, from the Greek word  , meaning “turn.” All tropisms involve turning toward or away from a stimulus. Through chemotropism, chemical stimuli help insects find places to lay their eggs. The carrion beetle, for example, deposits eggs on decayed meat—drawn to it by odor. Butterflies and bees are attracted to flowers by odor as well as color. The scent glands of various insects help them attract a mate. Insects also avoid certain substances by chemotropic reactions. Clothes chests made of cedar or camphor wood have long been used for storing woolens and furs because these woods contain substances repellent to clothes moths. Many insects seem to be attracted to or repelled by light (phototropism). Moths are attracted to artificial light and moonlight but avoid sunlight. Butterflies react in the opposite way. Cockroaches in a dark room hide when a light is turned on.     Response to gravity (geotropism) may govern the way various boring insects react. Thermotropism, or attraction to heat, may draw parasites to their warm-blooded hosts. Thigmotropism is reaction to touch. Some insects avoid all contact with others; some thrive in close contact. The swarming of bees may be due to an attraction to one another’s bodies. Attraction to water (hydrotropism), adjustment to currents of streams (rheotropism), and adjustment to air currents (anemotropism) may explain the behavior of a wide variety of insects. However, no single stimulus governs all of their complex activities.   Insects belong to the phylum Arthropoda, one of the chief divisions of the   kingdom. The name comes from two Greek words,   (“joint”) and   (“foot”), and refers to the jointed feet. Arthropods also include spiders, lobsters, centipedes, and other animals. In this phylum, insects belong to the class Insecta. Each insect has two parts to its scientific name. For example, the housefly is   The first half of the name is that of the genus (a group of closely related species) to which the species   belongs. The many thousands of insect genera (plural of genus) are grouped under more than 900 families. These families, in turn, are grouped under as many as 30 orders. To summarize, the housefly is classified as follows: kingdom, Animalia; phylum, Arthropoda; class, Insecta (Hexapoda); order, Diptera; family, Muscidae; genus,  ; species,   Each of these groups is often divided even further into subgroups (subphylum, subclass, suborder, and so on). Insects appeared on Earth long before the advent of humans or the earliest mammals. The first insects probably evolved from primitive ringed worms. These insect ancestors were wingless and developed without metamorphosis, as do today’s silverfish. The oldest fossils of ancestral insect forms are believed to be some 350 million years old. There are also fossil records, from later eras, of highly developed forms very similar to the mayflies, cockroaches, and dragonflies now in existence. Some ancient insects were truly huge; dragonflies, for example, had a wingspread of 2 feet (0.61 meter) or more. Insects that attack humans or anything of value to humans are termed pests; many of these are mutually competitive with humans for the world’s food supply. Other insects are benefactors of humans, as they devour the carcasses of dead animals, pollinate orchards, manufacture honey, or simply serve as another link in the food chain of the animal kingdom, for humans eat the animals—including fish and birds—which, in turn, live upon the insects. 

About 10,000 species of insects have been classified as pests. Some are disease carriers, afflicting and often killing humans. Many insects prey upon domestic animals; others eat human food, clothing, and other possessions. Still others, in their quest for food or lodging, destroy trees, wood, and paper. 

As vectors, or transmitting agents, of disease organisms, insects have caused more deaths and have inflicted greater misery and hardship on humankind than all the wars of history. In their efforts to find food, insects wage their own war against the human race. Some feed upon humans directly. Notable among these are the true flies, including mosquitoes, horseflies, black flies, tsetse flies, and other two-winged pests. 

Perhaps humankind’s worst enemy among the insects is the mosquito. More lives have been lost as a result of malaria, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other mosquito-borne diseases than from all the other insect-borne diseases combined. The tsetse fly has been a serious deterrent to the development of much of tropical Africa, for the insect acts as a vector of trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness) among humans and of nagana, a serious disease of livestock. Horseflies and stable flies also transmit disease through their bites. The common housefly is not a biter, but it can carry myriad disease organisms on the hairs and the sticky secretions of its body. The assassin, or kissing, bug transmits the highly fatal Chagas’ disease. Bedbugs, fleas, and lice live on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. The human louse lives on the blood of humans alone and transmits typhus, relapsing fever, and trench fever.     The flea is potentially one of humankind’s deadliest enemies; rat fleas, for example, carry the germs of murine typhus and  , which wiped out about one-third of the population of Europe in four years in the mid-1300s.  

Insect pests in the home are most commonly chewers. One of the most troublesome of these—the clothes moth—attacks furs, woolens, and materials made of hair. The silverfish and the firebrat eat sized or stiffened material, such as the paper and bindings of books and starched clothing and curtains. In some parts of the United States, termites do considerable damage to furniture and paper products, as well as to the timber frameworks of buildings. 

Most insects are herbivorous—that is, they feed on plants. Virtually every part of a plant, from the flower to the root, is vulnerable to their attack. They do their damage in a variety of ways. Insects with chewing mouthparts are the most destructive plant eaters. A horde of grasshoppers, for example, can strip every blade of vegetation from a field in a few hours. The destruction caused by other chewing insects, such as beetles, can also be enormous. Insects with sucking mouthparts, though usually smaller and less conspicuous than the chewers, also do a great deal of damage to farm crops and to forest and garden plants. These insects pierce plant tissues and draw out the vital juices. These insects include the aphids, chinch bugs, cicadas, and scale insects. Damage is also done to the host plant from within by many other plant pests—usually as larvae. Some eat their way between the top and bottom layers of a leaf, giving it a blotched appearance. The leaf roller, the larval form of certain moths, rolls a leaf into a tube and spins silk to hold it together. The caterpillar then feeds on the leaf. Other insect pests tie several leaves together into a large nest. Gallflies cause swellings on buds, flowers, leaves, stems, bark, or roots of plants. Usually the female pierces the plant and lays an egg; the plant then grows a gall, or swelling, around the egg (   ). As long as a region is left in its natural state, no species of insect is likely to increase disproportionately in numbers. The balance of nature prevents this from happening. Every insect has natural enemies, such as the spider, the praying mantis, and many kinds of disease organisms, that help keep the number of insects down. The balance of nature in the New World was upset when settlers from Europe brought their domestic plants with them. Many insects that were harbored by these plants escaped the natural controls that were present in their old environments and became pests. The widespread use of such insecticides as DDT, now largely discontinued, also disrupted the balance of nature in some areas. Pests arrive in many ways and from many lands. The gypsy moth, for example, was brought to the United States for experiments in the 1860s. It escaped from the laboratory and before the end of the 19th century had cost millions of dollars annually in damage to shade trees. The Argentine ant, an enemy of field crops and stored foods, was a stowaway in a cargo that reached New Orleans, La., in 1891. The brown-tail moth, another shade-tree pest, reached New England from Europe in about 1897. The alfalfa weevil came to Utah in 1902 in soil adhering to imported plants. The corn borer was carried from southern Europe in 1909 in a shipment of broomcorn. Two serious pests came from Japan—the Oriental fruit moth, on cherry trees presented by the city of Tokyo to Washington, D.C., in 1913; and the Japanese beetle, on trees reaching New Jersey in 1916. Also in 1916, carloads of cottonseed from Mexico brought in the pink bollworm. Four arrived in 1920: the satin moth, an enemy of shade trees; the Asiatic beetle, which destroys lawns; the Mexican bean beetle, which feeds on a variety of beans; and the Mediterranean fruit fly, which is highly destructive of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Until the middle of the 19th century Americans were helpless against the growing insect menace. Finally, in the 1860s, arsenic compounds were found to be effective in combating the Colorado potato beetle. This was the first successful control of insect pests by scientific means. In the Morrill Act, in 1862, Congress provided for the study of insect pests and other agricultural problems. Six principal methods are used in the control of insect pests. These methods are chemical, mechanical, radiological, cultural, biological, and legal. The chemical substances used to destroy insects are called insecticides. These may be broadly classified as stomach poisons, contact poisons, fumigants, and sorptive dusts. The stomach poisons are more effective against the chewing insects; the contact poisons, against sucking insects. Fumigants are gaseous poisons that enter the insect’s breathing system. Sorptive dusts are dry chemical compounds that kill insects by absorbing fatty substances from the exoskeleton, thus causing vital body fluids to evaporate. Mechanical methods of insect control—often primitive and time-consuming—are generally less effective than chemical methods. They can seldom be applied practically to large populations of insects or over wide areas. These methods include swatting, the use of traps and barriers, water control, and temperature control. Water control involves adjustment of the water level or the rate of flow in breeding places. Temperature control is sometimes effective against insects that infest enclosed storage facilities. Reducing the temperature to 40° or 50°  F (4° or 10°  C) will cause most insects to become dormant; raising the temperature to 130°  F (54°  C) for three hours is sufficient to kill almost any insect. Perhaps the most dramatic, wholesale destruction of insects can be accomplished by making them infertile. Sexual sterility in male insects is induced by treating them with the rays of radioactive cobalt. If a large number of a particular species undergo this process in the laboratory, the treated males—though sterile—will still mate with fertile females; but the eggs laid by these females will be sterile. Following continual releases of sterile males in a single area, the number of young can be gradually reduced over a period of several generations until the population of the insect is totally wiped out within that area. Through this technique the screwfly, a serious pest of cattle, was first eradicated from the island of Curaçao in the West Indies in 1954. Radiological warfare was then used to bring the screwfly under control in the southeastern United States. The cultural control of insect pests is of special interest to the farmer. Methods include the destruction of plant residues and weeds, crop tillage, crop rotation, and the growing of insect-resistant strains of crops. When the farmer destroys the crop residues and weeds, he also destroys hibernating insects that would otherwise reproduce the following season. By plowing or cultivating at the right time of year, he can often eliminate large numbers of harmful insects living in the soil. Crop rotation is an important means of combating insect pests of field crops, for many such pests will feed on only a single species or a single family of plant. Thus, if a farmer grows a grain one season and a legume the next, populations of many grain pests (as well as legume pests) can be kept down or eliminated. Insect-resistant strains of many crops have been developed. Many of these strains have been developed by means of   techniques. Resistance to the European corn borer, the wireworm, and the chinch bug, for example, has been obtained in a single   hybrid through selective breeding. The control of insects by biological means involves the application of the pest’s natural enemies. These enemies may be microbes, mites, or other insects. Scientists have succeeded in controlling harmful insects by first determining the major predators or parasites of that insect in its country of origin. Then the scientists introduced these natural enemies as control agents in the new country that the pest had infested. A classic example is the cottony cushion scale, which threatened the survival of the California citrus industry in 1886. The predatory ladybird beetle, or vedalia beetle, was introduced from Australia, and within two years the scale insect had virtually disappeared from California. In eastern Canada in the early 1940s the vicious European spruce sawfly was completely controlled by the spontaneous appearance of a viral plant disease, perhaps unknowingly introduced from Europe. This event led to increased interest in plant diseases as potential means of pest control. The legal control of insects concerns government regulations to prevent the spread of insect pests from one country or region to another. The Federal Plant Quarantine Act of 1912 began the fight against imported pests by providing for inspectors at ports of entry. These officials examine all plant products as well as passengers’ baggage. Infested material is destroyed or thoroughly fumigated. Aircraft are examined and may be fumigated as soon as they arrive in the United States from countries where insect pests are a potential threat. By the time an immigrant pest is discovered in domestic plants, it is usually too late for eradication of the injurious insect. In some instances, however, control has been achieved. In 1929 the Mediterranean fruit fly was detected in Florida orchards; the insects threatened ruin to the fruit crop. State and federal entomologists united for battle, and all Florida was quarantined. Abandoned and rundown orchards were destroyed. Chemists developed new poison sprays. By the end of the summer not a “medfly” could be found in Florida. In 1956 a second such outbreak occurred; this too was put down after several months of intensive warfare. In 1981 a serious spread of the medfly threatened California’s agricultural regions with economic disaster. The pest had been imported accidentally in 1980. An attempt to control the insects by importing sterilized males from Peru failed. The Department of Agriculture threatened to quarantine the state’s produce unless the infected areas were fumigated. Governor Jerry Brown finally authorized helicopter spraying of the pesticide called malathion in July 1981. The spraying halted the threat to the California crops. (   .) 

Numerous species of plants depend upon insects to   them. In visiting   for nectar, insects carry pollen from one flower to the pistil of another. In this way they fertilize the plant and enable it to make seeds. Without insects there would be no orchard fruits or berries. Tomatoes, peas, onions, cabbages, and many other vegetables would not exist. There would be no clover or alfalfa. The animals that need these forage crops would be of poor quality, and humankind’s meat supply would suffer. There would be no linen or cotton; no tea, coffee, or chocolate. The honeybee produces honey and wax. Silk is made by the silkworm larva. Shellac is secreted by an Oriental scale insect. Such insects as the dobsonfly are used in sport fishing as bait. In many underdeveloped areas of the world grasshoppers, caterpillars, and other insects are necessary to humans as food. Insects are also important to humans as food for other animals. Freshwater fishes depend upon insects for food. Hundreds of species of birds would perish if there were no insects to eat. Insects have also played a significant role in the biological laboratory. The   fly, in particular, has been valuable in the study of inherited characteristics (   ). The European blister beetle, or Spanish fly, is helpful in the fight against human disease, for it secretes cantharidin, a substance used medically as a blistering agent. Many insects are invaluable as predators on insects that are pests to humans. In the same way, plant-eating insects are often valuable for their destruction of weeds. Insects that burrow in the earth improve the physical and chemical condition of the soil. As scavengers, insects perform the important function of eating dead plants and animals. The housefly, scorned as a disease carrier, is beneficial in its larval form—the maggot. It feeds on decaying refuse and in this way makes the world somewhat cleaner and more habitable for others.

(baptized Feb. 12, 1637, Amsterdam—died Feb. 15, 1680, Amsterdam) was a Dutch naturalist, considered the most accurate of classical microscopists, who was the first to observe and describe red blood cells (1658). Swammerdam completed medical studies in 1667 but never practiced medicine, devoting himself to microscopical investigations instead. Turning to the study of insects, he accurately described and illustrated the life histories and   of many species. His observations of their development led him to separate insects into four major divisions, according to the degree and type of  . Three of these divisions have been more or less retained in modern classification. During the period he devoted to exhaustive entomological research (1667–73), he completed   popularly recognized as a major work at the time, and the   one of the finest collections of microscopical observations ever published. In these works he corrected the physiologist     of the   brain and   and opposed the physician   inconsistent interpretation of insect  . He also demonstrated the presence of   wings in caterpillars about to undergo pupation. Studying the anatomy of the tadpole and the adult frog, he noted a cleavage in the egg and discovered valves in the lymphatic vessels, now known as  Swammerdam valves. He described the ovarian follicles of mammals in the same year as the physician   (1672) and devised improved techniques for injecting wax and dyes into cadavers, which had important consequences for the study of human anatomy. His ingenious experiments showed that muscles alter in shape but not in size during contraction, contradicting the classic Greek physician   popular theory that a material fluid passing through the nerves is responsible for the movement. After his father refused to continue his financial support, Swammerdam suffered extreme privations. Subject in the last years of his life to fits of depression, he sought relief by becoming a   of the religious enthusiast  .

It was accidentally introduced into the   from   about 1916, probably as   in the soil around imported plants. Japanese beetles are known to feed on more than 200 species of plants, including a wide variety of trees, shrubs, grasses, and nursery plants. They are   insects, often feeding in large groups upon a single tree. A swarm of Japanese beetles can denude a   tree in 15 minutes, leaving nothing but bare branches and the fruit pits. Female beetles burrow from 25 to 100 mm (1 to 4 inches) below the surface of the soil to deposit their eggs, which hatch in about 14 days. The larvae live the entire winter below the surface of the ground in this stage, feeding on the tender roots of plants. During May the larvae transform to prepupa and then to pupa stages, the adult beetles   in June or July. The beetles range from Maine to  , and infestations have been noted in other parts of  . The adult  , about 10 mm (0.4 inch) long, is bright metallic green in colour with coppery-brown wing covers (elytra), five patches of white spots on each side, and two prominent white tufts on top of the exposed tip of the abdomen. Unlike the larva, the adult feeds on the flowers, fruit, and foliage of the plant. Efforts are being made to control the spread of this pest. Poisonous sprays control the adult beetles but differ in the length of their protection against reinfestation. Several of the beetle’s natural enemies—species of parasitic wasps and flies that in Japan were found to prey on the larvae—have been imported into the United States, where some of them have become established. Of even greater promise as a   is a disease-inducing bacterium,   which causes milky disease in larvae; its use has reduced Japanese beetle infestations in some areas.

His investigations of the living insect body and its tissues and organs revealed much about the   complexity of individual insects and their interactions with the  . His   (1934) is often considered the foundation for this branch of  . After   in France during  , Wigglesworth completed his education at the   and   Hospital in London. He lectured in medical entomology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and later was reader in entomology first at the  , then at Cambridge. In 1943 he was appointed director of the Agricultural Research Council Unit of Insect Physiology in Cambridge. He was knighted in 1964. Among Wigglesworth’s most significant discoveries were those concerned with  , particularly the control of form and growth. In insects such as the South American blood-sucking bug   Wigglesworth was able to determine that a crucial   was produced in the neurosecretory cells of its brain, the first experimental demonstration of the function of such cells. He then discovered another hormone that actually prevented the development of adult characteristics in   until the insect had reached the appropriate larval stage. Wigglesworth found that this hormone, which he called the  , was produced in the region of the endocrine gland known as the corpus allatum. He found that he could radically distort the developmental phases of his insect subjects by a selective manipulation of their hormonal levels. Finally, Wigglesworth was thus able to formulate a   theory of insect   involving the selective activation by hormones of the insect’s genetic components, which in turn determine its   and developmental character. Besides making these discoveries, Wigglesworth isolated the properties of various insect enzymes and the mechanism for the hatching of insect eggs.

Content: ,  Any of more than 20,000, usually winged, insect species in the order Hymenoptera. The abdomen is attached to the thorax by a slender petiole, or “waist,” and the female’s abdomen has a formidable stinger. Most species are solitary; about 1,000 species are highly social; and some may be either social or solitary. Adults feed primarily on nectar. Most solitary wasps nest in tunnels in the ground and feed larvae with paralyzed insects or spiders. The paperlike nest of social wasps (family Vespidae) consists of chewed plant material mixed with saliva and arranged in adjacent hexagonal cells. The female lays one egg in each cell and provisions it with a macerated caterpillar. Successive generations may enlarge the nest and care for the young.

Since the metamerism of Annelida and Arthropoda and that of Chordata probably arose independently, metamerism does not itself imply relationships between the groups; however, the particular metamerism within each group clearly demonstrates the   relationship of its members. Among acanthocephalans, rotifers, and some other “aschelminth” groups, external ringlike formations, called  annulations, occur in the covering tissues, sometimes so marked as to suggest segmentations; these formations prove to be only superficial, however, and are not indicative of true segmentation.

The adult housefly is dull gray with dirty-yellowish areas on the abdomen and longitudinal lines on the  . Body size ranges from about 5 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 inch), and the     eyes have approximately 4,000 facets. Because it has sponging or lapping mouthparts, the housefly cannot bite; a near relative, the  , however, does bite. The housefly can walk on vertical window panes or hang upside down on a ceiling probably because of the surface-tension properties of a secretion produced by tiny glandular pads (pulvilli) beneath each claw on the feet. The female deposits more than 100 slender whitish eggs (0.8 to 1 mm long) at a time, producing between about 600 and 1,000 eggs in her life. These eggs hatch in 12 to 24 hours.

Ants occur worldwide but are most numerous, both in numbers and in species, in tropical and subtropical regions. Ants are essential members of the   they inhabit, and some even serve as   that have a disproportionately large effect on their ecological  . Some ants are considered pests to humans, and a number are   in areas outside their native ranges.   . Ants range in size from about 2 to 25 mm (about 0.08 to 1 inch). Their color is usually yellow, brown, red, or black. A few genera (e.g.,   of  ) have a metallic luster. Typically, an ant has a large head and a slender, oval   joined to the  , or midsection, by a small waist. In all ants there are either one or two finlike extensions running across the thin waist  . The antennae are always elbowed. There are two sets of jaws: the outer pair is used for carrying objects such as food and for digging, and the inner pair is used for chewing. Some species, such as the debilitating   ( ), have a powerful sting at the tip of the abdomen. Ants are  , and the colony is a family   of which every ant is an   unit. Apart from the community, any one individual cannot properly function or survive, and the   are completely dependent upon the continuous care of the adults. There are generally three  , or classes, within a colony:  , males, and workers. Male ants play no part in everyday nest activities. They live only for a short time, occur in limited numbers, and are virtual parasites of the colony, which must feed them. The fertile female, the queen, performs only one task: egg laying. The life cycle of the ant has four stages—egg, larva,  , and adult—and typically spans a period of 8 to 10 weeks for worker ants. At certain times of the year, the winged males and virgin queens   into the air, where the queen mates with a single male. During the flight he transfers to her   receptacle all the   she will require for the rest of her life, which may be as long as 15 years. The males die soon afterward, and the fertilized queen establishes a new nest or takes over the current nest. Her wings then drop off, and the bulky wing muscles degenerate, providing nutritive materials from the breakdown of the   tissue. As soon as the wings have fallen, her ovaries become functional, and egg laying begins. In primitive species, the queen leaves the nest and forages for food for the larvae. In more advanced forms, the queen rarely leaves the nest. She feeds so-called nutrition eggs or other food stores within her own body to the first brood. The larvae that survive in the nest develop into dwarf workers, which   outside the nest for food to nourish additional larvae. The essential work in the ant society—such as building the nest, feeding and tending the brood, and defending the nest—is performed by the workers, all of whom are female. The workers can be   morphologically and physiologically as soldiers, outside workers, inside workers, and nest builders. In the division of labor among some ant forms, highly specialized types of   have developed. The   ants, for example, make nests in hollow stems of plants, then bore a circular entrance that remains under constant surveillance by special guards whose heads are modified into pluglike structures that fit the entrance. Each guard is relieved after several hours, and another guard takes its place; entrance guards are useless for other tasks.   repletes are a special type of worker that are fed so much that the size of their abdomens is greatly increased. Unable to walk, they hang as living honey jugs from the ceiling of the nest, to be used as a food source when fresh food is  . Most ants live in nests, which may be located in the ground or under a rock or built aboveground and made of twigs, sand, or gravel. Many subterranean nests are quite extensive, with a multitude of tunnels and specialized chambers.   ( ) are large black ants common in North America that live in old logs and timbers. Some species live in trees or in the hollow stems of weeds. Tailor, or weaver, ants, found in the tropics of Africa (e.g.,  ), make nests of leaves and similar materials held together with silk secreted by the larvae.  , a   of ants that are found worldwide, glues together bits of animal feces for its nest. The widely distributed pharaoh ant ( ), a small yellowish insect, builds its nest either in houses, when found in cool climates, or outdoors, when it occurs in warm climates. The food of ants consists of both plant and animal substances. Many ants are generalists and utilize a wide range of organic substances for food. Worker ants forage daily, and collected food and water is brought to the larvae and mature ants in the nest. They frequently use scent marks, which they place on their pathways, to find their way back to the nest and direct other colony members to a food source. Some ant species are hunters and scavengers. Bullet ants, for example,   for live  ,  , and  , including  , beetles, and  , or their carcasses. Certain species, including those of the genus  , often eat the eggs and larvae of other ants or those of their own species in other nests.   (genus  ) scavenge for dead insects on the scorching sand and salt-pan terrain of the  ; they can tolerate surface temperatures of 60 °C (140 °F) or higher for short periods, making them one of the most heat-tolerant groups of insects known. Some species eat the liquid secretions of plants, either directly or indirectly from the bodies of other insects. Many ants collect   from floral or extrafloral  , and some     and  . A number of ants, known as herder ants (  and others), protect and carefully tend to herds of  , from which the ants collect honeydew (a by-product of digestion secreted by certain aphids). The   ( ,  , and others) store honeydew in the distended abdomens of specialized workers. Some genera ( ) eat the honeydew that has fallen onto the surface of a leaf. The so-called Argentine ant ( ) and many   ( ) also eat honeydew.  ( ,  ) store grass, seeds, or berries in the nest, whereas ants of the genus   of   eat only  , which they   in their nests.

Acacia ants ( ) inhabit the bullhorn acacia (or bullhorn wattle;  ). The ants obtain food and shelter, and the acacia depends on the ants for protection from browsing animals, which the ants drive away. Neither member can survive successfully without the other, exemplifying obligative  . Slave-making ants, of which there are many species, have a variety of methods for “enslaving” the ants of other species. The queen of   of Africa, for example, allows herself to be dragged by   ants into their nest. She then bites off the head of the   queen and begins laying her own eggs, which are cared for by the “enslaved”   workers. Workers of the slave-making ant   raid nests of   ants, stealing the latter’s pupae. The pupae are raised by   to serve as slaves, and, because the   pupae become imprinted on the chemical odor of the slave-making ants, as adults the captive ants forage and routinely return to the slave-making ant nest. Some species live in the nests of other species as  . In these species the   larvae are given food and nourishment by the host workers.   is a parasite in the nests of  , the most common ant of northern Africa. , of the subfamily Dorylinae, are nomadic and   for the destruction of plant and animal life in their path.

Some     species are gall inquilines, meaning they do not cause the formation of galls but inhabit those made by other insects. The overgrowth of tissue, or gall, presumably is caused by a substance secreted by the immature   living within it. Adults of most of the approximately 600 species of gall wasps that occur in   are about 6 to 8 mm (about 0.25 to 0.30 inch) long and black.

Many of these wasps attack   trees or   plants. Male gall wasps are rare, and reproduction usually occurs by   (i.e., larvae develop from unfertilized eggs). The egg passes through the long ovipositor of the female and into the plant tissue. After the egg hatches into a larva, it begins to secrete materials that cause the plant tissues around it to begin to grow faster than normal. The gall increases in size as the larva grows. The larva feeds on the plant tissue within the gall and pupates and transforms into an adult within the gall.

The presence of six legs was once an important feature in the identification of true insects and enabled the identification of the apterygotes, including the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans and the now   Thysanura—the four groups that together made up the traditional subclass Apterygota (class Insecta). However, the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans are now considered by some entomologists to be offshoots from the main insectan stem of   and have been given independent taxonomic status as classes equivalent to the class  . The term  , therefore, is sometimes applied only to those groups thought to be ancestors of pterygotes—i.e., the  , fishmoths, and   (order Zygentoma) and the   (order Archaeognatha), together with the extinct   (order Monura). For completeness of discussion, however, and because of the similarities of these primitive hexapods, the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans, as well as orders Zygentoma, Archaeognatha, and Monura, are included in this article.  are minute (to 2 mm [0.08 inch] in length), elongated, and white and lack antennae. Distributed throughout the world in soil and leaf litter, they number about 800 species.   are   in form, coloration, and habitat. Most species are less than 3 mm (0.1 inch) in length, but some range to 10 mm (0.4 inch). They have either elongated or globular bodies with antennae and may have a furcula (ventral abdominal springing organ). Collembolans occur in   and leaf litter throughout the world, including  . There are more than 8,200 known species.   are white or yellowish, blind, elongated with long antennae, and less than 10 mm in length, although one group attains 50 mm (2 inches). Their two tail filaments (or threadlike structures) can be long and thin, short and thick, or in the form of pincers. Diplurans are widely distributed in soil, leaf litter, and rotting logs. More than 800 species have been described. Zygentoma and Archaeognatha are mainly long with three elongated tail filaments. Mostly 5 to 20 mm (0.2 to 0.8 inch) in length when fully grown, these insects are widely distributed in leaf litter, although some live in   and   nests. Zygentoma have small   eyes and styli (i.e., bristlelike processes) only on the  . Archaeognatha have large compound eyes and styli on the legs and abdomen. More than 350 species of Zygentoma and Archaeognatha are known. The largest of the extinct Monura were about 30 mm (1.2 inches) in length. The immature stages in all apterygotes are called  . The young are similar to adults, changing little (slight  ) from molt to molt until sexual maturity is attained. In some groups, molting may continue throughout adult life. The greatest changes occur in the Protura, which is the only anamorphic hexapod group (i.e., an increase in number of body segments occurs at time of molting). The complete number of segments is present only after the third molt. There are at least six stages between molts (instars), and the last is the adult. Little is known about the postembryonic development of Diplura. Most species feed on both living and dead vegetable matter and  , although one group preys on other small  . The   of the Collembola are diverse. Females may lay up to 800 eggs that hatch in 2 to 40 days. Three to 12 juvenile molts occur in intervals ranging from 11 days to a year, with up to 50 molts occurring in a lifetime, which can last from 4 to 18 months. Most Collembola feed on living or decaying   material as well as on fungi,  , and  , while a few feed on carrion or are predatory. In Zygentoma there may be more than 40 molts, although the adult stage is usually reached after about 12 molts. The   ( ) reaches sexual maturity in two or three years and molts multiple times in each   year (sometimes molting more than two dozen times in a single year). They can live as long as seven years. In Archaeognatha there are six instars including adults. Both Zygentoma and Archaeognatha feed on decaying or dried vegetable material. Domestic silverfish eat plant and   remains,  , and artificial  .  in apterygote groups is mainly sexual, but   (reproduction without  ) can occur. Males deposit   packets, often haphazardly, that are taken up by females and stored until the time for fertilization. In proturans small external genitalia of unusual form surround the gonopore in both sexes. Collembolans lack external genitalia, but the gonopore and surrounding area differ. In diplurans external genitalia are absent or vestigial. Zygentoma and Archaeognatha have external genitalia similar to those of the pterygotes. However, the   in males is used to deposit sperm drops and not as a copulative organ. The   and pickup of sperm drops in Zygentoma and Archaeognatha must take place during each adult stage if young are to be produced since the contents of the female sperm receptacle are lost with each molt.

Content: From frogs that give birth through their mouths to crabs with 6-foot legs, these animals are some of the strangest you’ll hopefully never have to see. Besides just looking strange, these   are exposed to some pretty extreme environments. Discovered in 2010, the yeti crab ( ) lives in   near   that reach temperatures of up to 720 °F (380 °C). Their white coloring and strange hair patterns are thought to be adaptations to these extreme environments. The thermal vents, while ridiculously hot inside, are surrounded by freezing waters. This forces all the yeti crabs to cram themselves into a small area. (One marine biologist found 600 of these crabs in one vent!) Females, however, must venture into the dangerously cold waters to  , as the thermal vents are too high in   content for the crabs’ eggs to survive. The mother yeti crab rarely survives the cold water, usually dying of starvation after her children hatch. As for those hairy arms, they are a garden of sorts, growing bacteria that the crab then feeds on.  This insect may be only ¼ of an inch long, but do not be deceived: it packs quite a terrifying punch. The   ( ), despite its name, is actually a species of wasp. Because of high levels of  , males have wings but females do not, giving the females an antlike appearance. Velvet ants can be found in the hotter portions of the  . As if the existence of crawling wasps weren’t enough to warrant night terrors, these freakishly fuzzy insects can deliver enough poison in one sting to subdue a  —which weighs about 2,000 pounds, equivalent to 13 average-sized humans. Not only are the adult velvet ants terrifying, but even as   these bugs are nightmarish. When laying eggs, females seek out nests of other ground-dwelling insects. When the eggs hatch, the newborn velvet ants feed on the other insects’ larvae. Yikes! Red-lipped   ( ) are by no means dangerous, but they   clearly a product of an evolutionary nightmare. This aptly named sea creature is found on ocean floors 3–76 meters deep and is known best for its bright red lips and the difficulty it has when swimming. Yes, you read that right—a fish that has difficulty swimming. Its fins serve as “legs,” of sorts, on which the fish walks across the ocean floor. This striking red-lipped   of a fish is actually most likely a male—those red lips are thought to attract mates. I guess everyone has a type.  Okay, this   might not look all that grotesque, but it gives birth  . After the eggs are externally fertilized by a male, the female swallows her eggs. The eggs hatch as tadpoles in her stomach and grow until they become full-size frogs—and then mom regurgitates them up (ew!) over the span of a week. Unfortunately (or fortunately), these frogs went extinct in the 1980s. Scientists, however, are attempting to bring them back to life using a method of   called  , because who doesn’t love the idea of mouth-birthing Frankenstein frogs.  If you haven’t had nightmares about this guy already, you definitely will now. Named the “World’s Ugliest Animal” of 2013, the blobfish ( ) has made quite a splash (or maybe a flop) in the scientific and pop-cultural communities since its discovery in 2003. The blobfish is a gelatinous mass that floats above the ocean floor at depths of 600–1,200 meters. They have bones, but, because of the intense pressure they are exposed to at such depths, the bones are very soft and malleable. Since blobfish lack any substantial muscle, they feed only on   and other edible materials that happen to swim in front of their strange, strange mouths. Although these guys are absolutely ghastly looking on land and in observatories, their low-density flesh has led scientists to the understanding that they aren’t as, well, “blobby” when deep underwater. Their   tendencies may fascinate scientists, but to laypeople the blobfish is just unsettling. Talk about a face only a mother could love.  These massive creatures are absolutely spine-chilling…or, in their case,  -chilling. The   ( ) has a leg span of 10–12 feet. (That’s twice the height of an average human!) Clearly deserving of their name, these   resemble giant underwater spiders (yikes!) and feed on smaller crustaceans as well as plants. Japanese spider crabs were discovered in 1836 and are found mainly in waters surrounding the southern coast of  . They hang out at depths of 150–300 meters and are currently a subject of conservation efforts because of overfishing. They are actually considered a delicacy in many parts of Japan. Can you imagine ordering crab legs and being served one that’s six feet long?  Philippine tarsiers ( ), or really just   in general, are some of the strangest looking   mammals on Earth. With eyes that take up half of their head, tarsiers grow only to be the size of a human fist. Their heads can rotate 180 degrees—an evolutionary trait that surfaced in response to the fixation of their eyes in their head. They have powerful hind legs that allow them to jump up to three feet at a time. As suggested by the size of their optics, they have fantastic night vision—which at times results in their pupils covering the entirety of their eyes. There have been problems involving these fellows being illegally sold as pets. There’s a market for everything—even scary-looking mini-mammals.  At first glance, this   might not seem all that terrifying, but it is a giant  , four feet tall (some have been recorded as reaching five feet tall), that is known to eat turtles, fish, and young crocodiles. The shoebill ( ) has long thin legs as well as a disproportionately large head and bill. It lives in the swamps of eastern   and has been found to   its prey before consuming it. When shoebills have offspring, they focus their attention on only the eldest. Should two eggs hatch, the parents reject the younger hatchling, and in some cases the elder attempts siblicide (killing of a sibling). The younger offspring is theorized to function as a backup in case something happens to the elder. This is thought to be a form of energy conservation, but it seems just plain evil. Look at that nightmarish grin.  These   may appear to be just funny-looking cousins of the terrifying crocs we are more familiar with. However, their disproportionately long jaws are lined with 110 razor-sharp teeth. That’s 30 more than the typical crocodile, and their teeth are much sharper.   ( ) can grow to be 20 feet long and can weigh up to 350 pounds. They are found in   and  , specifically in major northern river systems. Males exhibit a   trait atop the end of their snout called a   (after a type of Indian pottery), from which the crocodile gets its name. These massive creatures don’t attack humans but will feed on corpses set afloat during funeral ceremonies.  We’ll finish this unnerving list with what might be the most underrated nightmare-dwelling animal alive. The star-nosed   ( ) can be found in wet low areas, typically in eastern   and the northeastern  . Its main claim to fame is its strange pink fleshy ring around the snout, called the  . The star is jam-packed with nerve fibers and functions similar to our eyes: it paints a picture of the mole’s surroundings by using its keen sense of touch. The giant claws are used for digging tunnels beneath swamps—the mole’s primary habitat. The star-nosed mole is also considered the fastest eating   on Earth, consuming insects in less than 0.2 second. These guys are pretty interesting, but they still look like hairy aliens.

(Some authorities use the name Hemiptera; others consider both the heteropterans and the homopterans to be suborders of the Hemiptera.) This large group of insects, consisting of more than 40,000 species, can be recognized by an X-shaped design on the back, which is formed by the wings at rest. A combination of features—sucking mouthparts adapted to pierce plant or   tissues and a hardened gula (underside of the head)—separate the heteropterans from all other insect orders. Although most species of Heteroptera are terrestrial, a few are aquatic. Some species, which feed on plant juices, are serious pests of   crops. Other species are predacious and benefit humans by destroying various pests. There also are heteropterans that act as carriers of disease. Heteropterans can be divided into three large groups on the basis of general habitat: the water-dwelling Hydrocorisae ( ,  ,  ,  , and  ); the surface-swimming and shore-dwelling Amphibicorisae ( ,   and  ,  , and  ); and the Geocorisae, a large group of land bugs ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  ). Like any other biologically successful group of organisms, the heteropterans are   and   and have adapted to a variety of habitats. They range in length from more than 100 mm (3.9 inches) to less than 1 mm (0.039 inch) and have invaded habitats from dry land to water. One of the few insect groups with aquatic adults capable of obtaining adequate oxygen from the water, heteropterans include the only insect species that spend their lives on oceans far from land. Some heteropterans are nourished by blood of animals ranging from mites to humans. Others feed from the sap of plants as diverse as giant redwoods and algae. Some suck surface fluids (e.g., nectar), some pierce tissues to suck sap or blood, and others obtain nourishment from dried seeds. Many forms live on open surfaces and escape enemies by running, flying, or remaining inconspicuously motionless. Some seek food and shelter in natural crevices, and others actively burrow into the soil or seek out the nests of animals. Heteropterans are most   in the tropics, decreasing in both individuals and species to limits northward beyond the   and southward almost to the  . Every major landmass harbours different species, and migrations to new habitats may be aided by natural agents (e.g., wind, birds, floating debris) or by humans. Although heteropterans have been carried throughout the world, only a few species have become established in many lands. Unique among insects are some water striders (Gerridae), which are at home on the open ocean between approximately 40° north latitude and 40° south latitude and may not approach land for several generations. More than 40,000 species of heteropterans are known. Most families containing 150 or more species are represented in every  . Two exceptions are the Phymatidae (ambush bugs), with no species known in Australia or the  , and the Plataspidae, with no New World species. Families with the fewest species have the most restricted ranges: Aphylidae, Hyocephalidae, and Lestoniidae are restricted to Australia and contain among them only five species. The Velocipedidae of the Orient and the Vianaididae of the American tropics number four species each. In general, zoogeographic restriction is most evident at the subfamily, tribal, and generic levels. Heteropterans have complex and important roles in the balance of nature. The majority of them occupy an intermediate position in the ecological food chain; they use food producers (plants) and serve as food sources for   and other animals. A few species utilize plant-feeding insects as food. Heteropterans often serve as food for humans and other animals. In some Latin American countries eggs of certain aquatic bugs are collected by providing submerged mats of hollow reeds or straws as egg-laying sites; the eggs are then dried and made into cakes. Chickens, turkeys, hogs, and other domestic stock consume available heteropterans. Aquatic bugs are an important food source for fish. Wild birds and mammals, from the wrens and shrews to the turkey and  , utilize available heteropterans in their diets. Species that attack unwanted plants and feed on the eggs, immature stages, and adults of injurious insects include most assassin bugs,  , anthocorid bugs, stinkbugs, and plant bugs. These heteropterans are used in   of   weeds and injurious insects.

About 84 percent of all known species of animals are members of this phylum. Arthropods are represented in every habitat on Earth and show a great variety of adaptations. Several types live in aquatic environments, and others reside in terrestrial ones; some groups are even adapted for flight. The distinguishing feature of arthropods is the presence of a jointed skeletal covering composed of chitin (a complex sugar) bound to protein.  ...(100 of 5803 words)

(baptized Feb. 12, 1637, Amsterdam—died Feb. 15, 1680, Amsterdam) was a Dutch naturalist, considered the most accurate of classical microscopists, who was the first to observe and describe red blood cells (1658). Swammerdam completed medical studies in 1667 but never practiced medicine, devoting himself to microscopical investigations instead. Turning to the study of insects, he accurately described and illustrated the life histories and   of many species. His observations of their development led him to separate insects into four major divisions, according to the degree and type of  . Three of these divisions have been more or less retained in modern classification. During the period he devoted to exhaustive entomological research (1667–73), he completed   popularly recognized as a major work at the time, and the   one of the finest collections of microscopical observations ever published. In these works he corrected the physiologist     of the   brain and   and opposed the physician   inconsistent interpretation of insect  . He also demonstrated the presence of   wings in caterpillars about to undergo pupation. Studying the anatomy of the tadpole and the adult frog, he noted a cleavage in the egg and discovered valves in the lymphatic vessels, now known as  Swammerdam valves. He described the ovarian follicles of mammals in the same year as the physician   (1672) and devised improved techniques for injecting wax and dyes into cadavers, which had important consequences for the study of human anatomy. His ingenious experiments showed that muscles alter in shape but not in size during contraction, contradicting the classic Greek physician   popular theory that a material fluid passing through the nerves is responsible for the movement. After his father refused to continue his financial support, Swammerdam suffered extreme privations. Subject in the last years of his life to fits of depression, he sought relief by becoming a   of the religious enthusiast  .

Content: The insects are the largest group of  . In fact, about 75 percent of all animals are insects. Insects developed on Earth long before humans did. Today there are about 1 million known species, or types, of insect. And scientists are constantly discovering new species. Butterflies, beetles, ants, flies, grasshoppers, silverfish, and bees are all insects. Insects live all over the world. They can survive in almost any place where food is available. For instance, insects can be found in cold regions, hot rain forests, deserts, mountains, caves, and freshwater. A few kinds even live in salt water. Insects are members of a larger group called the arthropods. This group also includes spiders, ticks, centipedes, lobsters, and crabs. Like all arthropods, insects have a body that is divided into segments, or sections. They also lack a skeleton inside the body. Instead, insects and other arthropods have a covering on the outside of the body called an exoskeleton. This exoskeleton protects the body. Unlike other arthropods, insects have three major body segments. Insects also have six legs. This is one way that insects differ from spiders, which have eight legs. Insects also have at least one pair of antennas, or feelers. The three major segments of an insect body are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The head contains the insect’s antennas, mouthparts, and eyes. The adults of many species have two kinds of eyes, simple and compound. Compound eyes have many lenslike parts. Each of these receives a separate image. The images are combined into a single picture in the insect’s brain. The thorax has three pairs of legs and usually two pairs of wings. But some insects have only one pair of wings or no wings at all. The abdomen is made up of as many as 11 segments. It contains organs that digest food, push out wastes, and help the insect reproduce. Insects vary greatly in size. Most insects are small, usually less than 0.2 inch (6 millimeters) long. However, some insects called walkingsticks can grow to more than 12 inches (30 centimeters) long. Insects have a variety of ways to protect themselves from their enemies. For example, some insects hide by blending in to their surroundings. Many moths have a similar   to the bark of the trees on which they rest. Beetles have a very hard body armor to protect them. Some insects bite or sting their enemies. Some kinds produce poison. Some kinds of insects live alone, while others live in groups. Termites, ants, and some bees and wasps live in very organized groups. Each individual has a particular job to do for the group. For example, some termites are born to be soldiers or workers. Other termites will be the king and queen. Insects eat a great variety of plants, animals, and other living things. Certain insects, such as fleas and lice, live on the body of another animal. They get all their food from that animal’s body. Such insects are called  . Most insects hatch from eggs. A few kinds are born live. An insect’s exoskeleton cannot grow. Instead, as the insect grows, this covering splits apart and falls off from time to time. The insect grows a new covering. This process is called molting. There are two basic life cycles found in insects. Some insects are born in nearly the same form they will have as an adult. The insect grows and molts, eventually becoming an adult. Grasshoppers and cockroaches go through this kind of growth process. Other types undergo a complete change, or  . After they hatch, they begin life in a form called a larva. It is completely unlike the adult form. For instance, a larva may look more like a worm than an insect. The larva eats a great deal and molts several times. It then enters a resting stage in a form called a pupa. The pupa’s body changes greatly during this stage. It develops all of the features of the adult, including wings and legs. When this stage is complete, the adult emerges from the pupa. Bees, butterflies, and moths are some insects that develop this way. Many insects are helpful to humans and other animals. Some kinds eat other insects that are pests. Insects are also food for other animals. Some insects produce valuable products such as honey, silk, and dyes. Many flowering plants depend on insects such as bees to help them reproduce. As insects feed on flowers, they spread a substance called   from the male parts of flowers to the female parts. This allows the female parts to make seeds. Insects can also be pests. Some insects sting or bite people or other animals. Many insects can spread diseases to people, other animals, and plants. And some harmful insects eat crops, wood, clothing, and carpet.

The world’s most abundant creatures are the insects, whose known species outnumber all the other animals and the plants combined. Insects have been so successful in their fight for life that they are sometimes described as the human race’s closest rivals for domination of the Earth. Entomologists, the scientists who study insects, have named almost 1,000,000 species—perhaps less than one third of the total number. Insects thrive in almost any habitat where life is possible. Some are found only in the Arctic regions, and some live only in deserts. Others thrive only in fresh water or only in brackish water. Many species of insects are able to tolerate both freezing and tropical temperatures. Such hardy species are often found to range widely over the Earth. Few insects, however, inhabit marine environments. Small size, relatively minor food requirements, and rapid reproduction have all aided in perpetuating the many species of insects. Certain parasitic insects spend much of their lives on or within the body of an animal host, where all the comforts of life—food, moisture, warmth, protection from enemies—are optimal. Other kinds of insects spend all or some part of their lives securely enclosed in a food plant. Some species have become remarkably versatile in order to meet the changing demands of the environment. Various water bugs and water beetles are able to fly and swim, as well as crawl. Many types of insects, such as the bees, ants, and wasps depend on a complex social structure and defensive behavior. Nonpredatory species frequently have special defenses, such as an unpleasant taste or odor, venomous spines, or camouflage. Although they are adaptable and versatile as a group, insects are often unable to adjust to unusual weather conditions. Excessive rain, an unusually early frost, an extended drought—these and other weather extremes can quickly wipe out or drastically reduce insect populations in a region. Because insects are an important item in the diet of many other animals—birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, as well as other insects—the number is constantly held in check. The total of all factors unfavorable to insect survival is overwhelming; thus, in some species, out of hundreds of eggs laid by a single female, seldom do more than a few individuals reach adulthood. The survival of some species is enhanced by the large numbers of eggs laid. 


Despite their diversity, all adult insects share some basic external and internal anatomical features. Insects are distinguished from other members of the animal kingdom by having six legs; one pair of antennae; a ringed, or segmented, body; and three well-defined body regions. It is from the joined body rings, or segments, that insects derived their name, for the Latin word   means “segmented.” Many creatures closely resemble insects and are often mistaken for them—for instance, spiders and scorpions, which have eight legs; centipedes, which have dozens of legs; and mites and ticks, which have saclike bodies unbroken by segments. The name bug refers to certain insects with piercing and sucking mouthparts but is also commonly applied to insects in general. 

The three main sections of an insect body are the head; the middle section, or thorax; and the hind section, or abdomen. The body is covered with a horny substance containing chitin. The protective armor plate also serves as an external skeleton, or  , for the support of the internal organs. 

The head bears the antennae, the mouthparts, and the eyes. The thorax has three segments; on each is a pair of legs. In winged insects the thorax also bears one or two pairs of wings. The abdomen typically has 11 segments, though no more than 10 are visible; it contains a large part of the digestive system. In females the ovipositor, or egg-laying organ, is located at the tip of the abdomen. The nervous system of the insect includes a brain and a pair of parallel nerve cords, which extend along the length of the underside of the body. Along the nerve cords are a series of nerve masses, called ganglia. Each ganglion controls certain activities and is more or less independent of the others. Insect blood is usually green, yellow, or colorless. Few insects have red blood. The fluid is not enclosed in a system of arteries, veins, and capillaries but fills the body cavity. It is circulated by a tube that extends down the length of the body along the center of the back. The tube has valved intake openings along its sides and is open at the anterior, or front, end. By means of muscles, it draws the blood through the side openings and pumps it forward into the head cavity and out again into the body. The pulsations of the tube can be easily seen in light-colored caterpillars. Air enters the body through breathing pores, called spiracles. A pair of spiracles is usually found on each of two thoracic segments and on several abdominal segments. From the spiracles, large air tubes called tracheae and smaller ones known as tracheoles carry air to all parts of the body. Some water insects breathe by means of gills. Other aquatic insects have a snorkellike tube that leads to the water’s surface. Certain internal parasites and very primitive insects breathe directly through the body wall. 

Mouthparts vary with feeding habits. For example, the mouth of a chewing insect, such as the grasshopper, has several parts. There is an upper lip, the labrum, and a lower lip, the labium. Between these are two pairs of jaws, which work sideways. The upper jaws, or mandibles, are for crushing; the lower pair, the maxillae, manipulate the food. On the maxillae and on the labium are two pairs of sensory structures called palpi. On the floor of the mouth is the tonguelike hypopharynx, which secretes digestive juices. The sucking type of mouth is a modification of the chewing type. The butterfly’s coiled proboscis, or sucking tube, is a modification of the maxillae. The sense organs of insects are as varied as they are intricate. In some of these creatures the visual organs are capable of nothing more than distinguishing night from day. Others have eyes as efficient and sensitive as those of the vertebrates. 

Insect eyes are of two general types—simple and compound. Simple eyes, also called ocelli, are usually located in small clusters on the sides of the head or on the frons, or forehead. Although small, they may easily be seen by means of a magnifying glass. Ocelli are found in both immature and mature insects, but they appear to be more important in the mature forms. Individually these organs can do no more than detect light; however, the sensations received by several ocelli can together produce in the insect’s brain an image of the surrounding area as the creature turns its head from side to side. Compound eyes, like the sight organs of higher animals, are present in pairs, with one eye on each side of the head. They are most common in adult insects. Some—certain mayflies, for example—have two pairs of compound eyes. The eyes are called compound because each one is composed of many lenslike facets. Each of these facets—of which there are, for example, some 25,000 in a single dragonfly eye—receives a separate image. The total effect of these images is a composite picture in the insect’s brain. The eyes of many insects—bees, for example—are sensitive to ultraviolet light, but insect eyes are generally less sensitive to colors at the red end of the  . The antennae are vital structures, because organs of taste, touch, smell, and hearing may be located in them. The loss of the pair of antennae usually leaves the insect in a shocked and helpless state. Their appearance and structure may vary greatly, even between insects of the same order. The hearing organs of insects are well developed in many species and are found on various parts of the body. The ears of katydids and crickets are located on the tibiae of the forelegs. The typical grasshopper’s ear is clearly visible as an oval plate on the first abdominal segment. Insect sounds are produced by specialized structures to attract the opposite sex, to communicate with other members of a group, or to frighten enemies. Wings or mouthparts may be rubbed together. Legs may be scraped against wings or bodies. The grubs of certain wood-boring beetles produce sound by rubbing their legs together. The male cicada vibrates miniature “drumheads” on the lower surface of its abdomen. The song of the female mosquito comes from the vibration of special bands stretched across its breathing organs. 


The development from egg to adult is most interesting, especially in those insects that go through the complex changes called complete metamorphosis. The growth of insects is quite different from that of vertebrates because the insect skeleton is an external covering rather than an internal framework. Except for the pliable fold between the plates of chitinous cuticle making up the exoskeleton, there is no place where expansion can occur; thus the growing insect must periodically shed, or molt, its covering. The new skin, already formed, then expands and begins to harden. The offspring of all insects undergo a varying number of such growth intervals before maturity. Adult insects do not grow at all. With the exception of the subimago (subadult) stage of the mayfly, only adults have functional wings. Primitive species such as silverfish mature with little change in appearance except their size. These kinds of insects are known as ametabolous insects. The immature insects of such species are called simply the “young.” Immature grasshoppers, cicadas, the true bugs, and a number of other types resemble the adults in many respects but lack functional wings. Such young, called nymphs, are hemimetabolous or are said to exhibit incomplete metamorphosis. A variation of such development occurs in dragonflies, mayflies, and caddis flies. The nymphs of these forms are aquatic and have a way of life quite unlike that of the adults. Bees, beetles, butterflies, and moths are some of the insects that go through all the changes of complete metamorphosis. They are said to be holometabolous. The young are called larvae (singular, larva). In the inactive stage immediately preceding adulthood they are called pupae (singular, pupa). 


The larva hatches from an egg. Often larvae are mistaken for worms. They may be smooth-bodied, like the maggots of the fly, or hairy, like some caterpillars (literally, “hairy cat”), or they may be vicious-looking, like the grub of the tiger beetle. Larvae are classified into five forms, based on their shape: eruciform (caterpillarlike), scarabaeiform (grublike), campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active), elateriform (wirewormlike), and vermiform (maggotlike). Larvae differ from adults in many respects. The mouthparts may be completely different. The mouth is always well developed, for this stage is the hungriest period of the insect’s life. Eyes, if present, are usually simple rather than compound. Certain structures found in the larva may be absent in the adult. Caterpillars, for example, have several additional legs, called prolegs, along the abdomen. 





Near the end of its larval stage, the insect must find a place in which to pupate, or turn into a pupa. Beetle larvae, as well as certain caterpillars, may hollow out cells in the soil. Some caterpillars may spin silken cocoons about their bodies; some may spin bands to hold themselves against twigs or leaves. Some caterpillars hang upside down from silken pads. Hairy caterpillars pluck out their hairs to line the walls of their cocoons.     The pupal stage is a time of tissue transformation. During this period different kinds of mouthparts, legs, eyes, and, perhaps, breathing organs must replace those of the larva. When the changes are completed, the creature bursts out of its old skin to become a fully developed insect. In this final, sexually mature state, it is also known as an imago.   Each species of insect, in its struggle for survival, has developed complex behavior mechanisms and habits. These involve every activity of daily life—including egg laying, nest building, self-defense, and the search for food. Most species of insects are of two sexes, but in some—the white-fringed beetle, for example—males are unknown. In certain insects the sex of the offspring depends upon whether or not the egg has been fertilized. The unmated females of some parasitic wasps produce males only, while mated ones produce the two sexes in about equal numbers. The queen honeybee can lay either fertilized or unfertilized eggs, according to the needs of the hive. Unfertilized eggs produce drones, while fertilized eggs produce females. 

The adult female instinctively places her eggs in a place suitable for their hatching and for proper development of the young. Parasitic wasps and flies place their eggs directly on the host. The horse botfly glues her eggs to the hairs of the horse where they can be licked off and thus be transferred to the horse’s stomach; the larvae live on the lining of the stomach and intestines. If a caterpillar feeds on only one species of plant, then the egg from which it will hatch is unerringly placed upon that plant. 

Often insects’ eggs are hidden in special protective materials. They may be encased in frothy secretions which dry to form a hard covering, or clusters of eggs may be coated with hairs or scales from the adult insect’s body. The eggs of many species are inserted directly into plant tissues by means of sawlike or spearlike ovipositors. 

The young of some insects are born alive. Such insects are called viviparous (from Latin  , “alive,” and  , “bring forth”), to distinguish them from egg-laying insects, which are called oviparous (from Latin  , “egg”). Aphids sometimes lay eggs and sometimes produce live young; female aphids also bear young for many generations without mating. This is called parthenogenesis (from the Greek words meaning “virgin birth”). A few insects reproduce in the larval or pupal stages. This is known as paedogenesis (from the Greek words meaning “birth from young”). 

Nest building as an adult activity is peculiar to ants, wasps, and bees. Carpenter ants live in galleries, which they chew out of tree trunks, logs, and fence posts. Mound-building ants construct cities in the soil, with thousands of chambers and passageways. The great paper apartment houses of the paper wasps and the honeycombs of the bees are considered to be marvels of engineering. 

Nesting species must feed their larvae. Ants forage for food for their young. Some species raise fungus gardens and cultivate aphid “cows,” whose liquid excrement, or honeydew, they eat. The mud dauber wasp lays its eggs in tubes of mud. It then stocks the tubes with paralyzed spiders and seals the tubes. After the larvae hatch, a sufficient food supply is at hand until they pupate. Each species of insect usually passes the winter in one particular phase of development. Some butterflies winter as pupae, caterpillars, or eggs. The monarch butterfly migrates long distances southward in the fall; some survive for a return flight in the spring. In the winter some insects may come out of hibernation during brief periods of mild weather. Snow scorpion flies and springtails are often found on snow or ice. Honeybees in well-protected hives use their body heat to maintain a hive temperature that permits them to remain somewhat active and to feed on stored sweets. They leave the hive when the temperature rises to about 55°  F (13°  C). Extreme heat or drought brings about a period of inactivity called estivation. The eggs of mosquitoes do not hatch and the nymphs and adults of many aquatic insects become dormant when the breeding ponds and marshes dry up. Insects have developed many methods of self-defense to avoid being devoured by their enemies. Flight, concealment, motion, armor and weapons, and even grotesqueness are some of these methods. Certain insects are specially adapted for hiding. Vast numbers hide beneath stones or the bark of trees. The flattened bodies of cockroaches and bedbugs enable them to disappear into narrow cracks. 


The most interesting means of concealment are   and  . The walkingstick looks like a twig. Certain moths blend so well into the bark of the tree on which they rest that they cannot be distinguished from the tree. Some harmless insects resemble stinging species in shape or color and so are avoided by predators. Certain moths and flies mimic bees. Armor and weapons are well developed in many insects. The tough, horny covering of the beetles amounts to a solid shell of armor. Sharp jaws and beaks, poisoned stingers, and spines serve as effective weapons. The extreme hairiness of some caterpillars makes birds and other predators avoid them, and in some caterpillars the hairs have venomous spines. Stink glands in some insects repel attackers in the same way as those in a skunk. When disturbed, the bombardier beetle ejects an irritating gas from its tail. The gas may be fired repeatedly and audibly. Grasshoppers exude a fluid popularly known as “tobacco juice.” The flavor of some insects is so bitter or sour that would-be predators avoid eating them. Insects are not able to reason. They are guided by instinct and by physiological reactions to their environment. Such reactions are called tropisms, from the Greek word  , meaning “turn.” All tropisms involve turning toward or away from a stimulus. Through chemotropism, chemical stimuli help insects find places to lay their eggs. The carrion beetle, for example, deposits eggs on decayed meat—drawn to it by odor. Butterflies and bees are attracted to flowers by odor as well as color. The scent glands of various insects help them attract a mate. Insects also avoid certain substances by chemotropic reactions. Clothes chests made of cedar or camphor wood have long been used for storing woolens and furs because these woods contain substances repellent to clothes moths. Many insects seem to be attracted to or repelled by light (phototropism). Moths are attracted to artificial light and moonlight but avoid sunlight. Butterflies react in the opposite way. Cockroaches in a dark room hide when a light is turned on.     Response to gravity (geotropism) may govern the way various boring insects react. Thermotropism, or attraction to heat, may draw parasites to their warm-blooded hosts. Thigmotropism is reaction to touch. Some insects avoid all contact with others; some thrive in close contact. The swarming of bees may be due to an attraction to one another’s bodies. Attraction to water (hydrotropism), adjustment to currents of streams (rheotropism), and adjustment to air currents (anemotropism) may explain the behavior of a wide variety of insects. However, no single stimulus governs all of their complex activities.   Insects belong to the phylum Arthropoda, one of the chief divisions of the   kingdom. The name comes from two Greek words,   (“joint”) and   (“foot”), and refers to the jointed feet. Arthropods also include spiders, lobsters, centipedes, and other animals. In this phylum, insects belong to the class Insecta. Each insect has two parts to its scientific name. For example, the housefly is   The first half of the name is that of the genus (a group of closely related species) to which the species   belongs. The many thousands of insect genera (plural of genus) are grouped under more than 900 families. These families, in turn, are grouped under as many as 30 orders. To summarize, the housefly is classified as follows: kingdom, Animalia; phylum, Arthropoda; class, Insecta (Hexapoda); order, Diptera; family, Muscidae; genus,  ; species,   Each of these groups is often divided even further into subgroups (subphylum, subclass, suborder, and so on). Insects appeared on Earth long before the advent of humans or the earliest mammals. The first insects probably evolved from primitive ringed worms. These insect ancestors were wingless and developed without metamorphosis, as do today’s silverfish. The oldest fossils of ancestral insect forms are believed to be some 350 million years old. There are also fossil records, from later eras, of highly developed forms very similar to the mayflies, cockroaches, and dragonflies now in existence. Some ancient insects were truly huge; dragonflies, for example, had a wingspread of 2 feet (0.61 meter) or more. Insects that attack humans or anything of value to humans are termed pests; many of these are mutually competitive with humans for the world’s food supply. Other insects are benefactors of humans, as they devour the carcasses of dead animals, pollinate orchards, manufacture honey, or simply serve as another link in the food chain of the animal kingdom, for humans eat the animals—including fish and birds—which, in turn, live upon the insects. 

About 10,000 species of insects have been classified as pests. Some are disease carriers, afflicting and often killing humans. Many insects prey upon domestic animals; others eat human food, clothing, and other possessions. Still others, in their quest for food or lodging, destroy trees, wood, and paper. 

As vectors, or transmitting agents, of disease organisms, insects have caused more deaths and have inflicted greater misery and hardship on humankind than all the wars of history. In their efforts to find food, insects wage their own war against the human race. Some feed upon humans directly. Notable among these are the true flies, including mosquitoes, horseflies, black flies, tsetse flies, and other two-winged pests. 

Perhaps humankind’s worst enemy among the insects is the mosquito. More lives have been lost as a result of malaria, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other mosquito-borne diseases than from all the other insect-borne diseases combined. The tsetse fly has been a serious deterrent to the development of much of tropical Africa, for the insect acts as a vector of trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness) among humans and of nagana, a serious disease of livestock. Horseflies and stable flies also transmit disease through their bites. The common housefly is not a biter, but it can carry myriad disease organisms on the hairs and the sticky secretions of its body. The assassin, or kissing, bug transmits the highly fatal Chagas’ disease. Bedbugs, fleas, and lice live on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. The human louse lives on the blood of humans alone and transmits typhus, relapsing fever, and trench fever.     The flea is potentially one of humankind’s deadliest enemies; rat fleas, for example, carry the germs of murine typhus and  , which wiped out about one-third of the population of Europe in four years in the mid-1300s.  

Insect pests in the home are most commonly chewers. One of the most troublesome of these—the clothes moth—attacks furs, woolens, and materials made of hair. The silverfish and the firebrat eat sized or stiffened material, such as the paper and bindings of books and starched clothing and curtains. In some parts of the United States, termites do considerable damage to furniture and paper products, as well as to the timber frameworks of buildings. 

Most insects are herbivorous—that is, they feed on plants. Virtually every part of a plant, from the flower to the root, is vulnerable to their attack. They do their damage in a variety of ways. Insects with chewing mouthparts are the most destructive plant eaters. A horde of grasshoppers, for example, can strip every blade of vegetation from a field in a few hours. The destruction caused by other chewing insects, such as beetles, can also be enormous. Insects with sucking mouthparts, though usually smaller and less conspicuous than the chewers, also do a great deal of damage to farm crops and to forest and garden plants. These insects pierce plant tissues and draw out the vital juices. These insects include the aphids, chinch bugs, cicadas, and scale insects. Damage is also done to the host plant from within by many other plant pests—usually as larvae. Some eat their way between the top and bottom layers of a leaf, giving it a blotched appearance. The leaf roller, the larval form of certain moths, rolls a leaf into a tube and spins silk to hold it together. The caterpillar then feeds on the leaf. Other insect pests tie several leaves together into a large nest. Gallflies cause swellings on buds, flowers, leaves, stems, bark, or roots of plants. Usually the female pierces the plant and lays an egg; the plant then grows a gall, or swelling, around the egg (   ). As long as a region is left in its natural state, no species of insect is likely to increase disproportionately in numbers. The balance of nature prevents this from happening. Every insect has natural enemies, such as the spider, the praying mantis, and many kinds of disease organisms, that help keep the number of insects down. The balance of nature in the New World was upset when settlers from Europe brought their domestic plants with them. Many insects that were harbored by these plants escaped the natural controls that were present in their old environments and became pests. The widespread use of such insecticides as DDT, now largely discontinued, also disrupted the balance of nature in some areas. Pests arrive in many ways and from many lands. The gypsy moth, for example, was brought to the United States for experiments in the 1860s. It escaped from the laboratory and before the end of the 19th century had cost millions of dollars annually in damage to shade trees. The Argentine ant, an enemy of field crops and stored foods, was a stowaway in a cargo that reached New Orleans, La., in 1891. The brown-tail moth, another shade-tree pest, reached New England from Europe in about 1897. The alfalfa weevil came to Utah in 1902 in soil adhering to imported plants. The corn borer was carried from southern Europe in 1909 in a shipment of broomcorn. Two serious pests came from Japan—the Oriental fruit moth, on cherry trees presented by the city of Tokyo to Washington, D.C., in 1913; and the Japanese beetle, on trees reaching New Jersey in 1916. Also in 1916, carloads of cottonseed from Mexico brought in the pink bollworm. Four arrived in 1920: the satin moth, an enemy of shade trees; the Asiatic beetle, which destroys lawns; the Mexican bean beetle, which feeds on a variety of beans; and the Mediterranean fruit fly, which is highly destructive of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Until the middle of the 19th century Americans were helpless against the growing insect menace. Finally, in the 1860s, arsenic compounds were found to be effective in combating the Colorado potato beetle. This was the first successful control of insect pests by scientific means. In the Morrill Act, in 1862, Congress provided for the study of insect pests and other agricultural problems. Six principal methods are used in the control of insect pests. These methods are chemical, mechanical, radiological, cultural, biological, and legal. The chemical substances used to destroy insects are called insecticides. These may be broadly classified as stomach poisons, contact poisons, fumigants, and sorptive dusts. The stomach poisons are more effective against the chewing insects; the contact poisons, against sucking insects. Fumigants are gaseous poisons that enter the insect’s breathing system. Sorptive dusts are dry chemical compounds that kill insects by absorbing fatty substances from the exoskeleton, thus causing vital body fluids to evaporate. Mechanical methods of insect control—often primitive and time-consuming—are generally less effective than chemical methods. They can seldom be applied practically to large populations of insects or over wide areas. These methods include swatting, the use of traps and barriers, water control, and temperature control. Water control involves adjustment of the water level or the rate of flow in breeding places. Temperature control is sometimes effective against insects that infest enclosed storage facilities. Reducing the temperature to 40° or 50°  F (4° or 10°  C) will cause most insects to become dormant; raising the temperature to 130°  F (54°  C) for three hours is sufficient to kill almost any insect. Perhaps the most dramatic, wholesale destruction of insects can be accomplished by making them infertile. Sexual sterility in male insects is induced by treating them with the rays of radioactive cobalt. If a large number of a particular species undergo this process in the laboratory, the treated males—though sterile—will still mate with fertile females; but the eggs laid by these females will be sterile. Following continual releases of sterile males in a single area, the number of young can be gradually reduced over a period of several generations until the population of the insect is totally wiped out within that area. Through this technique the screwfly, a serious pest of cattle, was first eradicated from the island of Curaçao in the West Indies in 1954. Radiological warfare was then used to bring the screwfly under control in the southeastern United States. The cultural control of insect pests is of special interest to the farmer. Methods include the destruction of plant residues and weeds, crop tillage, crop rotation, and the growing of insect-resistant strains of crops. When the farmer destroys the crop residues and weeds, he also destroys hibernating insects that would otherwise reproduce the following season. By plowing or cultivating at the right time of year, he can often eliminate large numbers of harmful insects living in the soil. Crop rotation is an important means of combating insect pests of field crops, for many such pests will feed on only a single species or a single family of plant. Thus, if a farmer grows a grain one season and a legume the next, populations of many grain pests (as well as legume pests) can be kept down or eliminated. Insect-resistant strains of many crops have been developed. Many of these strains have been developed by means of   techniques. Resistance to the European corn borer, the wireworm, and the chinch bug, for example, has been obtained in a single   hybrid through selective breeding. The control of insects by biological means involves the application of the pest’s natural enemies. These enemies may be microbes, mites, or other insects. Scientists have succeeded in controlling harmful insects by first determining the major predators or parasites of that insect in its country of origin. Then the scientists introduced these natural enemies as control agents in the new country that the pest had infested. A classic example is the cottony cushion scale, which threatened the survival of the California citrus industry in 1886. The predatory ladybird beetle, or vedalia beetle, was introduced from Australia, and within two years the scale insect had virtually disappeared from California. In eastern Canada in the early 1940s the vicious European spruce sawfly was completely controlled by the spontaneous appearance of a viral plant disease, perhaps unknowingly introduced from Europe. This event led to increased interest in plant diseases as potential means of pest control. The legal control of insects concerns government regulations to prevent the spread of insect pests from one country or region to another. The Federal Plant Quarantine Act of 1912 began the fight against imported pests by providing for inspectors at ports of entry. These officials examine all plant products as well as passengers’ baggage. Infested material is destroyed or thoroughly fumigated. Aircraft are examined and may be fumigated as soon as they arrive in the United States from countries where insect pests are a potential threat. By the time an immigrant pest is discovered in domestic plants, it is usually too late for eradication of the injurious insect. In some instances, however, control has been achieved. In 1929 the Mediterranean fruit fly was detected in Florida orchards; the insects threatened ruin to the fruit crop. State and federal entomologists united for battle, and all Florida was quarantined. Abandoned and rundown orchards were destroyed. Chemists developed new poison sprays. By the end of the summer not a “medfly” could be found in Florida. In 1956 a second such outbreak occurred; this too was put down after several months of intensive warfare. In 1981 a serious spread of the medfly threatened California’s agricultural regions with economic disaster. The pest had been imported accidentally in 1980. An attempt to control the insects by importing sterilized males from Peru failed. The Department of Agriculture threatened to quarantine the state’s produce unless the infected areas were fumigated. Governor Jerry Brown finally authorized helicopter spraying of the pesticide called malathion in July 1981. The spraying halted the threat to the California crops. (   .) 

Numerous species of plants depend upon insects to   them. In visiting   for nectar, insects carry pollen from one flower to the pistil of another. In this way they fertilize the plant and enable it to make seeds. Without insects there would be no orchard fruits or berries. Tomatoes, peas, onions, cabbages, and many other vegetables would not exist. There would be no clover or alfalfa. The animals that need these forage crops would be of poor quality, and humankind’s meat supply would suffer. There would be no linen or cotton; no tea, coffee, or chocolate. The honeybee produces honey and wax. Silk is made by the silkworm larva. Shellac is secreted by an Oriental scale insect. Such insects as the dobsonfly are used in sport fishing as bait. In many underdeveloped areas of the world grasshoppers, caterpillars, and other insects are necessary to humans as food. Insects are also important to humans as food for other animals. Freshwater fishes depend upon insects for food. Hundreds of species of birds would perish if there were no insects to eat. Insects have also played a significant role in the biological laboratory. The   fly, in particular, has been valuable in the study of inherited characteristics (   ). The European blister beetle, or Spanish fly, is helpful in the fight against human disease, for it secretes cantharidin, a substance used medically as a blistering agent. Many insects are invaluable as predators on insects that are pests to humans. In the same way, plant-eating insects are often valuable for their destruction of weeds. Insects that burrow in the earth improve the physical and chemical condition of the soil. As scavengers, insects perform the important function of eating dead plants and animals. The housefly, scorned as a disease carrier, is beneficial in its larval form—the maggot. It feeds on decaying refuse and in this way makes the world somewhat cleaner and more habitable for others.

Ants occur worldwide but are most numerous, both in numbers and in species, in tropical and subtropical regions. Ants are essential members of the   they inhabit, and some even serve as   that have a disproportionately large effect on their ecological  . Some ants are considered pests to humans, and a number are   in areas outside their native ranges.   . Ants range in size from about 2 to 25 mm (about 0.08 to 1 inch). Their color is usually yellow, brown, red, or black. A few genera (e.g.,   of  ) have a metallic luster. Typically, an ant has a large head and a slender, oval   joined to the  , or midsection, by a small waist. In all ants there are either one or two finlike extensions running across the thin waist  . The antennae are always elbowed. There are two sets of jaws: the outer pair is used for carrying objects such as food and for digging, and the inner pair is used for chewing. Some species, such as the debilitating   ( ), have a powerful sting at the tip of the abdomen. Ants are  , and the colony is a family   of which every ant is an   unit. Apart from the community, any one individual cannot properly function or survive, and the   are completely dependent upon the continuous care of the adults. There are generally three  , or classes, within a colony:  , males, and workers. Male ants play no part in everyday nest activities. They live only for a short time, occur in limited numbers, and are virtual parasites of the colony, which must feed them. The fertile female, the queen, performs only one task: egg laying. The life cycle of the ant has four stages—egg, larva,  , and adult—and typically spans a period of 8 to 10 weeks for worker ants. At certain times of the year, the winged males and virgin queens   into the air, where the queen mates with a single male. During the flight he transfers to her   receptacle all the   she will require for the rest of her life, which may be as long as 15 years. The males die soon afterward, and the fertilized queen establishes a new nest or takes over the current nest. Her wings then drop off, and the bulky wing muscles degenerate, providing nutritive materials from the breakdown of the   tissue. As soon as the wings have fallen, her ovaries become functional, and egg laying begins. In primitive species, the queen leaves the nest and forages for food for the larvae. In more advanced forms, the queen rarely leaves the nest. She feeds so-called nutrition eggs or other food stores within her own body to the first brood. The larvae that survive in the nest develop into dwarf workers, which   outside the nest for food to nourish additional larvae. The essential work in the ant society—such as building the nest, feeding and tending the brood, and defending the nest—is performed by the workers, all of whom are female. The workers can be   morphologically and physiologically as soldiers, outside workers, inside workers, and nest builders. In the division of labor among some ant forms, highly specialized types of   have developed. The   ants, for example, make nests in hollow stems of plants, then bore a circular entrance that remains under constant surveillance by special guards whose heads are modified into pluglike structures that fit the entrance. Each guard is relieved after several hours, and another guard takes its place; entrance guards are useless for other tasks.   repletes are a special type of worker that are fed so much that the size of their abdomens is greatly increased. Unable to walk, they hang as living honey jugs from the ceiling of the nest, to be used as a food source when fresh food is  . Most ants live in nests, which may be located in the ground or under a rock or built aboveground and made of twigs, sand, or gravel. Many subterranean nests are quite extensive, with a multitude of tunnels and specialized chambers.   ( ) are large black ants common in North America that live in old logs and timbers. Some species live in trees or in the hollow stems of weeds. Tailor, or weaver, ants, found in the tropics of Africa (e.g.,  ), make nests of leaves and similar materials held together with silk secreted by the larvae.  , a   of ants that are found worldwide, glues together bits of animal feces for its nest. The widely distributed pharaoh ant ( ), a small yellowish insect, builds its nest either in houses, when found in cool climates, or outdoors, when it occurs in warm climates. The food of ants consists of both plant and animal substances. Many ants are generalists and utilize a wide range of organic substances for food. Worker ants forage daily, and collected food and water is brought to the larvae and mature ants in the nest. They frequently use scent marks, which they place on their pathways, to find their way back to the nest and direct other colony members to a food source. Some ant species are hunters and scavengers. Bullet ants, for example,   for live  ,  , and  , including  , beetles, and  , or their carcasses. Certain species, including those of the genus  , often eat the eggs and larvae of other ants or those of their own species in other nests.   (genus  ) scavenge for dead insects on the scorching sand and salt-pan terrain of the  ; they can tolerate surface temperatures of 60 °C (140 °F) or higher for short periods, making them one of the most heat-tolerant groups of insects known. Some species eat the liquid secretions of plants, either directly or indirectly from the bodies of other insects. Many ants collect   from floral or extrafloral  , and some     and  . A number of ants, known as herder ants (  and others), protect and carefully tend to herds of  , from which the ants collect honeydew (a by-product of digestion secreted by certain aphids). The   ( ,  , and others) store honeydew in the distended abdomens of specialized workers. Some genera ( ) eat the honeydew that has fallen onto the surface of a leaf. The so-called Argentine ant ( ) and many   ( ) also eat honeydew.  ( ,  ) store grass, seeds, or berries in the nest, whereas ants of the genus   of   eat only  , which they   in their nests. The Texas   ( ) is a   that often strips the leaves from plants to provide nourishment for its fungus gardens. The social behavior of ants, along with that of  , is the most complex in the insect world. The group is also extremely  , with any number of foraging, nesting, and social behaviors. Acacia ants ( ) inhabit the bullhorn acacia (or bullhorn wattle;  ). The ants obtain food and shelter, and the acacia depends on the ants for protection from browsing animals, which the ants drive away. Neither member can survive successfully without the other, exemplifying obligative  . Slave-making ants, of which there are many species, have a variety of methods for “enslaving” the ants of other species. The queen of   of Africa, for example, allows herself to be dragged by   ants into their nest. She then bites off the head of the   queen and begins laying her own eggs, which are cared for by the “enslaved”   workers. Workers of the slave-making ant   raid nests of   ants, stealing the latter’s pupae. The pupae are raised by   to serve as slaves, and, because the   pupae become imprinted on the chemical odor of the slave-making ants, as adults the captive ants forage and routinely return to the slave-making ant nest. Some species live in the nests of other species as  . In these species the   larvae are given food and nourishment by the host workers.   is a parasite in the nests of  , the most common ant of northern Africa. , of the subfamily Dorylinae, are nomadic and   for the destruction of plant and animal life in their path. The army ants of tropical America ( ), for example, travel in columns, eating insects and other invertebrates along the way. Periodically, the colony rests for several days while the queen lays her eggs. As the colony travels, the growing larvae are carried along by the workers. Habits of the   ( ) are similar.

His investigations of the living insect body and its tissues and organs revealed much about the   complexity of individual insects and their interactions with the  . His   (1934) is often considered the foundation for this branch of  . After   in France during  , Wigglesworth completed his education at the   and   Hospital in London. He lectured in medical entomology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and later was reader in entomology first at the  , then at Cambridge. In 1943 he was appointed director of the Agricultural Research Council Unit of Insect Physiology in Cambridge. He was knighted in 1964. Among Wigglesworth’s most significant discoveries were those concerned with  , particularly the control of form and growth. In insects such as the South American blood-sucking bug   Wigglesworth was able to determine that a crucial   was produced in the neurosecretory cells of its brain, the first experimental demonstration of the function of such cells. He then discovered another hormone that actually prevented the development of adult characteristics in   until the insect had reached the appropriate larval stage. Wigglesworth found that this hormone, which he called the  , was produced in the region of the endocrine gland known as the corpus allatum. He found that he could radically distort the developmental phases of his insect subjects by a selective manipulation of their hormonal levels. Finally, Wigglesworth was thus able to formulate a   theory of insect   involving the selective activation by hormones of the insect’s genetic components, which in turn determine its   and developmental character. Besides making these discoveries, Wigglesworth isolated the properties of various insect enzymes and the mechanism for the hatching of insect eggs.

Anna Botsford entered   in Ithaca,  , in 1874, but she left after two years. In 1878 she married  , a young entomologist on the Cornell   who interested her in   illustration. Throughout their marriage she functioned as his assistant, illustrating his lectures and publications on insects. Her work was usually on an informal, unpaid basis, but when he was chief entomologist in the   (1879–81), she received a formal appointment. There she prepared the drawings for his   (on citrus scale insects) of 1880. She then reentered Cornell and took a degree in natural history in 1885. Thereafter she studied   at  ,  , in order to prepare illustrations for her husband’s   (1888), and in 1888 she was one of the first four women admitted to Sigma Xi, a national honour society for the sciences. Comstock made engravings for the more than 600 plates in her husband’s   (1895) and for   (1897) and   (1904), both of which she co-authored. Her engravings were also widely exhibited and won several prizes.

Used in this sense, the term   commonly includes the primitive insects of the following groups:  , collembolans ( ),  , and   in the orders Zygentoma,  , and Monura (formerly the  ). The taxonomic status of the various groups that are considered apterygotes, however, remains unsettled. A typical apterygote, for example, is wingless and has six legs. The presence of six legs was once an important feature in the identification of true insects and enabled the identification of the apterygotes, including the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans and the now   Thysanura—the four groups that together made up the traditional subclass Apterygota (class Insecta). However, the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans are now considered by some entomologists to be offshoots from the main insectan stem of   and have been given independent taxonomic status as classes equivalent to the class  . The term  , therefore, is sometimes applied only to those groups thought to be ancestors of pterygotes—i.e., the  , fishmoths, and   (order Zygentoma) and the   (order Archaeognatha), together with the extinct   (order Monura). For completeness of discussion, however, and because of the similarities of these primitive hexapods, the proturans, collembolans, and diplurans, as well as orders Zygentoma, Archaeognatha, and Monura, are included in this article.  are minute (to 2 mm [0.08 inch] in length), elongated, and white and lack antennae. Distributed throughout the world in soil and leaf litter, they number about 800 species.   are   in form, coloration, and habitat. Most species are less than 3 mm (0.1 inch) in length, but some range to 10 mm (0.4 inch). They have either elongated or globular bodies with antennae and may have a furcula (ventral abdominal springing organ). Collembolans occur in   and leaf litter throughout the world, including  . There are more than 8,200 known species.   are white or yellowish, blind, elongated with long antennae, and less than 10 mm in length, although one group attains 50 mm (2 inches). Their two tail filaments (or threadlike structures) can be long and thin, short and thick, or in the form of pincers. Diplurans are widely distributed in soil, leaf litter, and rotting logs. More than 800 species have been described. Zygentoma and Archaeognatha are mainly long with three elongated tail filaments. Mostly 5 to 20 mm (0.2 to 0.8 inch) in length when fully grown, these insects are widely distributed in leaf litter, although some live in   and   nests. Zygentoma have small   eyes and styli (i.e., bristlelike processes) only on the  . Archaeognatha have large compound eyes and styli on the legs and abdomen. More than 350 species of Zygentoma and Archaeognatha are known. The largest of the extinct Monura were about 30 mm (1.2 inches) in length. The immature stages in all apterygotes are called  . The young are similar to adults, changing little (slight  ) from molt to molt until sexual maturity is attained. In some groups, molting may continue throughout adult life. The greatest changes occur in the Protura, which is the only anamorphic hexapod group (i.e., an increase in number of body segments occurs at time of molting). The complete number of segments is present only after the third molt. There are at least six stages between molts (instars), and the last is the adult. Little is known about the postembryonic development of Diplura. Most species feed on both living and dead vegetable matter and  , although one group preys on other small  . The   of the Collembola are diverse. Females may lay up to 800 eggs that hatch in 2 to 40 days. Three to 12 juvenile molts occur in intervals ranging from 11 days to a year, with up to 50 molts occurring in a lifetime, which can last from 4 to 18 months. Most Collembola feed on living or decaying   material as well as on fungi,  , and  , while a few feed on carrion or are predatory. In Zygentoma there may be more than 40 molts, although the adult stage is usually reached after about 12 molts. The   ( ) reaches sexual maturity in two or three years and molts multiple times in each   year (sometimes molting more than two dozen times in a single year). They can live as long as seven years. In Archaeognatha there are six instars including adults. Both Zygentoma and Archaeognatha feed on decaying or dried vegetable material. Domestic silverfish eat plant and   remains,  , and artificial  .  in apterygote groups is mainly sexual, but   (reproduction without  ) can occur. Males deposit   packets, often haphazardly, that are taken up by females and stored until the time for fertilization. In proturans small external genitalia of unusual form surround the gonopore in both sexes. Collembolans lack external genitalia, but the gonopore and surrounding area differ. In diplurans external genitalia are absent or vestigial. Zygentoma and Archaeognatha have external genitalia similar to those of the pterygotes. However, the   in males is used to deposit sperm drops and not as a copulative organ. The   and pickup of sperm drops in Zygentoma and Archaeognatha must take place during each adult stage if young are to be produced since the contents of the female sperm receptacle are lost with each molt.

Human fascination with   behaviour probably extends back millions of years, perhaps even to times before the ancestors of the species became human in the modern sense.

(Some authorities use the name Hemiptera; others consider both the heteropterans and the homopterans to be suborders of the Hemiptera.) This large group of insects, consisting of more than 40,000 species, can be recognized by an X-shaped design on the back, which is formed by the wings at rest. A combination of features—sucking mouthparts adapted to pierce plant or   tissues and a hardened gula (underside of the head)—separate the heteropterans from all other insect orders. Although most species of Heteroptera are terrestrial, a few are aquatic. Some species, which feed on plant juices, are serious pests of   crops. Other species are predacious and benefit humans by destroying various pests. There also are heteropterans that act as carriers of disease. Heteropterans can be divided into three large groups on the basis of general habitat: the water-dwelling Hydrocorisae ( ,  ,  ,  , and  ); the surface-swimming and shore-dwelling Amphibicorisae ( ,   and  ,  , and  ); and the Geocorisae, a large group of land bugs ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  ). Like any other biologically successful group of organisms, the heteropterans are   and   and have adapted to a variety of habitats. They range in length from more than 100 mm (3.9 inches) to less than 1 mm (0.039 inch) and have invaded habitats from dry land to water. One of the few insect groups with aquatic adults capable of obtaining adequate oxygen from the water, heteropterans include the only insect species that spend their lives on oceans far from land. Some heteropterans are nourished by blood of animals ranging from mites to humans. Others feed from the sap of plants as diverse as giant redwoods and algae. Some suck surface fluids (e.g., nectar), some pierce tissues to suck sap or blood, and others obtain nourishment from dried seeds. Many forms live on open surfaces and escape enemies by running, flying, or remaining inconspicuously motionless. Some seek food and shelter in natural crevices, and others actively burrow into the soil or seek out the nests of animals. Heteropterans are most   in the tropics, decreasing in both individuals and species to limits northward beyond the   and southward almost to the  . Every major landmass harbours different species, and migrations to new habitats may be aided by natural agents (e.g., wind, birds, floating debris) or by humans. Although heteropterans have been carried throughout the world, only a few species have become established in many lands. Unique among insects are some water striders (Gerridae), which are at home on the open ocean between approximately 40° north latitude and 40° south latitude and may not approach land for several generations. More than 40,000 species of heteropterans are known. Most families containing 150 or more species are represented in every  . Two exceptions are the Phymatidae (ambush bugs), with no species known in Australia or the  , and the Plataspidae, with no New World species. Families with the fewest species have the most restricted ranges: Aphylidae, Hyocephalidae, and Lestoniidae are restricted to Australia and contain among them only five species. The Velocipedidae of the Orient and the Vianaididae of the American tropics number four species each. In general, zoogeographic restriction is most evident at the subfamily, tribal, and generic levels. Heteropterans have complex and important roles in the balance of nature. The majority of them occupy an intermediate position in the ecological food chain; they use food producers (plants) and serve as food sources for   and other animals. A few species utilize plant-feeding insects as food. Heteropterans often serve as food for humans and other animals. In some Latin American countries eggs of certain aquatic bugs are collected by providing submerged mats of hollow reeds or straws as egg-laying sites; the eggs are then dried and made into cakes. Chickens, turkeys, hogs, and other domestic stock consume available heteropterans. Aquatic bugs are an important food source for fish. Wild birds and mammals, from the wrens and shrews to the turkey and  , utilize available heteropterans in their diets. Species that attack unwanted plants and feed on the eggs, immature stages, and adults of injurious insects include most assassin bugs,  , anthocorid bugs, stinkbugs, and plant bugs. These heteropterans are used in   of   weeds and injurious insects.

The world’s most abundant creatures are the insects, whose known species outnumber all the other animals and the plants combined. Insects have been so successful in their fight for life that they are sometimes described as the human race’s closest rivals for domination of the Earth. Entomologists, the scientists who study insects, have named almost 1,000,000 species—perhaps less than one third of the total number. Insects thrive in almost any habitat where life is possible. Some are found only in the Arctic regions, and some live only in deserts. Others thrive only in fresh water or only in brackish water. Many species of insects are able to tolerate both freezing and tropical temperatures. Such hardy species are often found to range widely over the Earth. Few insects, however, inhabit marine environments. Small size, relatively minor food requirements, and rapid reproduction have all aided in perpetuating the many species of insects. Certain parasitic insects spend much of their lives on or within the body of an animal host, where all the comforts of life—food, moisture, warmth, protection from enemies—are optimal. Other kinds of insects spend all or some part of their lives securely enclosed in a food plant. Some species have become remarkably versatile in order to meet the changing demands of the environment. Various water bugs and water beetles are able to fly and swim, as well as crawl. Many types of insects, such as the bees, ants, and wasps depend on a complex social structure and defensive behavior. Nonpredatory species frequently have special defenses, such as an unpleasant taste or odor, venomous spines, or camouflage. Although they are adaptable and versatile as a group, insects are often unable to adjust to unusual weather conditions. Excessive rain, an unusually early frost, an extended drought—these and other weather extremes can quickly wipe out or drastically reduce insect populations in a region. Because insects are an important item in the diet of many other animals—birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, as well as other insects—the number is constantly held in check. The total of all factors unfavorable to insect survival is overwhelming; thus, in some species, out of hundreds of eggs laid by a single female, seldom do more than a few individuals reach adulthood. The survival of some species is enhanced by the large numbers of eggs laid. 


Despite their diversity, all adult insects share some basic external and internal anatomical features. Insects are distinguished from other members of the animal kingdom by having six legs; one pair of antennae; a ringed, or segmented, body; and three well-defined body regions. It is from the joined body rings, or segments, that insects derived their name, for the Latin word   means “segmented.” Many creatures closely resemble insects and are often mistaken for them—for instance, spiders and scorpions, which have eight legs; centipedes, which have dozens of legs; and mites and ticks, which have saclike bodies unbroken by segments. The name bug refers to certain insects with piercing and sucking mouthparts but is also commonly applied to insects in general. 

The three main sections of an insect body are the head; the middle section, or thorax; and the hind section, or abdomen. The body is covered with a horny substance containing chitin. The protective armor plate also serves as an external skeleton, or  , for the support of the internal organs. 

The head bears the antennae, the mouthparts, and the eyes. The thorax has three segments; on each is a pair of legs. In winged insects the thorax also bears one or two pairs of wings. The abdomen typically has 11 segments, though no more than 10 are visible; it contains a large part of the digestive system. In females the ovipositor, or egg-laying organ, is located at the tip of the abdomen. The nervous system of the insect includes a brain and a pair of parallel nerve cords, which extend along the length of the underside of the body. Along the nerve cords are a series of nerve masses, called ganglia. Each ganglion controls certain activities and is more or less independent of the others. Insect blood is usually green, yellow, or colorless. Few insects have red blood. The fluid is not enclosed in a system of arteries, veins, and capillaries but fills the body cavity. It is circulated by a tube that extends down the length of the body along the center of the back. The tube has valved intake openings along its sides and is open at the anterior, or front, end. By means of muscles, it draws the blood through the side openings and pumps it forward into the head cavity and out again into the body. The pulsations of the tube can be easily seen in light-colored caterpillars. Air enters the body through breathing pores, called spiracles. A pair of spiracles is usually found on each of two thoracic segments and on several abdominal segments. From the spiracles, large air tubes called tracheae and smaller ones known as tracheoles carry air to all parts of the body. Some water insects breathe by means of gills. Other aquatic insects have a snorkellike tube that leads to the water’s surface. Certain internal parasites and very primitive insects breathe directly through the body wall. 

Mouthparts vary with feeding habits. For example, the mouth of a chewing insect, such as the grasshopper, has several parts. There is an upper lip, the labrum, and a lower lip, the labium. Between these are two pairs of jaws, which work sideways. The upper jaws, or mandibles, are for crushing; the lower pair, the maxillae, manipulate the food. On the maxillae and on the labium are two pairs of sensory structures called palpi. On the floor of the mouth is the tonguelike hypopharynx, which secretes digestive juices. The sucking type of mouth is a modification of the chewing type. The butterfly’s coiled proboscis, or sucking tube, is a modification of the maxillae. The sense organs of insects are as varied as they are intricate. In some of these creatures the visual organs are capable of nothing more than distinguishing night from day. Others have eyes as efficient and sensitive as those of the vertebrates. 

Insect eyes are of two general types—simple and compound. Simple eyes, also called ocelli, are usually located in small clusters on the sides of the head or on the frons, or forehead. Although small, they may easily be seen by means of a magnifying glass. Ocelli are found in both immature and mature insects, but they appear to be more important in the mature forms. Individually these organs can do no more than detect light; however, the sensations received by several ocelli can together produce in the insect’s brain an image of the surrounding area as the creature turns its head from side to side. Compound eyes, like the sight organs of higher animals, are present in pairs, with one eye on each side of the head. They are most common in adult insects. Some—certain mayflies, for example—have two pairs of compound eyes. The eyes are called compound because each one is composed of many lenslike facets. Each of these facets—of which there are, for example, some 25,000 in a single dragonfly eye—receives a separate image. The total effect of these images is a composite picture in the insect’s brain. The eyes of many insects—bees, for example—are sensitive to ultraviolet light, but insect eyes are generally less sensitive to colors at the red end of the  . The antennae are vital structures, because organs of taste, touch, smell, and hearing may be located in them. The loss of the pair of antennae usually leaves the insect in a shocked and helpless state. Their appearance and structure may vary greatly, even between insects of the same order. The hearing organs of insects are well developed in many species and are found on various parts of the body. The ears of katydids and crickets are located on the tibiae of the forelegs. The typical grasshopper’s ear is clearly visible as an oval plate on the first abdominal segment. Insect sounds are produced by specialized structures to attract the opposite sex, to communicate with other members of a group, or to frighten enemies. Wings or mouthparts may be rubbed together. Legs may be scraped against wings or bodies. The grubs of certain wood-boring beetles produce sound by rubbing their legs together. The male cicada vibrates miniature “drumheads” on the lower surface of its abdomen. The song of the female mosquito comes from the vibration of special bands stretched across its breathing organs. 


The development from egg to adult is most interesting, especially in those insects that go through the complex changes called complete metamorphosis. The growth of insects is quite different from that of vertebrates because the insect skeleton is an external covering rather than an internal framework. Except for the pliable fold between the plates of chitinous cuticle making up the exoskeleton, there is no place where expansion can occur; thus the growing insect must periodically shed, or molt, its covering. The new skin, already formed, then expands and begins to harden. The offspring of all insects undergo a varying number of such growth intervals before maturity. Adult insects do not grow at all. With the exception of the subimago (subadult) stage of the mayfly, only adults have functional wings. Primitive species such as silverfish mature with little change in appearance except their size. These kinds of insects are known as ametabolous insects. The immature insects of such species are called simply the “young.” Immature grasshoppers, cicadas, the true bugs, and a number of other types resemble the adults in many respects but lack functional wings. Such young, called nymphs, are hemimetabolous or are said to exhibit incomplete metamorphosis. A variation of such development occurs in dragonflies, mayflies, and caddis flies. The nymphs of these forms are aquatic and have a way of life quite unlike that of the adults. Bees, beetles, butterflies, and moths are some of the insects that go through all the changes of complete metamorphosis. They are said to be holometabolous. The young are called larvae (singular, larva). In the inactive stage immediately preceding adulthood they are called pupae (singular, pupa). 


The larva hatches from an egg. Often larvae are mistaken for worms. They may be smooth-bodied, like the maggots of the fly, or hairy, like some caterpillars (literally, “hairy cat”), or they may be vicious-looking, like the grub of the tiger beetle. Larvae are classified into five forms, based on their shape: eruciform (caterpillarlike), scarabaeiform (grublike), campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active), elateriform (wirewormlike), and vermiform (maggotlike). Larvae differ from adults in many respects. The mouthparts may be completely different. The mouth is always well developed, for this stage is the hungriest period of the insect’s life. Eyes, if present, are usually simple rather than compound. Certain structures found in the larva may be absent in the adult. Caterpillars, for example, have several additional legs, called prolegs, along the abdomen. 





Near the end of its larval stage, the insect must find a place in which to pupate, or turn into a pupa. Beetle larvae, as well as certain caterpillars, may hollow out cells in the soil. Some caterpillars may spin silken cocoons about their bodies; some may spin bands to hold themselves against twigs or leaves. Some caterpillars hang upside down from silken pads. Hairy caterpillars pluck out their hairs to line the walls of their cocoons.     The pupal stage is a time of tissue transformation. During this period different kinds of mouthparts, legs, eyes, and, perhaps, breathing organs must replace those of the larva. When the changes are completed, the creature bursts out of its old skin to become a fully developed insect. In this final, sexually mature state, it is also known as an imago.   Each species of insect, in its struggle for survival, has developed complex behavior mechanisms and habits. These involve every activity of daily life—including egg laying, nest building, self-defense, and the search for food. Most species of insects are of two sexes, but in some—the white-fringed beetle, for example—males are unknown. In certain insects the sex of the offspring depends upon whether or not the egg has been fertilized. The unmated females of some parasitic wasps produce males only, while mated ones produce the two sexes in about equal numbers. The queen honeybee can lay either fertilized or unfertilized eggs, according to the needs of the hive. Unfertilized eggs produce drones, while fertilized eggs produce females. 

The adult female instinctively places her eggs in a place suitable for their hatching and for proper development of the young. Parasitic wasps and flies place their eggs directly on the host. The horse botfly glues her eggs to the hairs of the horse where they can be licked off and thus be transferred to the horse’s stomach; the larvae live on the lining of the stomach and intestines. If a caterpillar feeds on only one species of plant, then the egg from which it will hatch is unerringly placed upon that plant. 

Often insects’ eggs are hidden in special protective materials. They may be encased in frothy secretions which dry to form a hard covering, or clusters of eggs may be coated with hairs or scales from the adult insect’s body. The eggs of many species are inserted directly into plant tissues by means of sawlike or spearlike ovipositors. 

The young of some insects are born alive. Such insects are called viviparous (from Latin  , “alive,” and  , “bring forth”), to distinguish them from egg-laying insects, which are called oviparous (from Latin  , “egg”). Aphids sometimes lay eggs and sometimes produce live young; female aphids also bear young for many generations without mating. This is called parthenogenesis (from the Greek words meaning “virgin birth”). A few insects reproduce in the larval or pupal stages. This is known as paedogenesis (from the Greek words meaning “birth from young”). 

Nest building as an adult activity is peculiar to ants, wasps, and bees. Carpenter ants live in galleries, which they chew out of tree trunks, logs, and fence posts. Mound-building ants construct cities in the soil, with thousands of chambers and passageways. The great paper apartment houses of the paper wasps and the honeycombs of the bees are considered to be marvels of engineering. 

Nesting species must feed their larvae. Ants forage for food for their young. Some species raise fungus gardens and cultivate aphid “cows,” whose liquid excrement, or honeydew, they eat. The mud dauber wasp lays its eggs in tubes of mud. It then stocks the tubes with paralyzed spiders and seals the tubes. After the larvae hatch, a sufficient food supply is at hand until they pupate. Each species of insect usually passes the winter in one particular phase of development. Some butterflies winter as pupae, caterpillars, or eggs. The monarch butterfly migrates long distances southward in the fall; some survive for a return flight in the spring. In the winter some insects may come out of hibernation during brief periods of mild weather. Snow scorpion flies and springtails are often found on snow or ice. Honeybees in well-protected hives use their body heat to maintain a hive temperature that permits them to remain somewhat active and to feed on stored sweets. They leave the hive when the temperature rises to about 55°  F (13°  C). Extreme heat or drought brings about a period of inactivity called estivation. The eggs of mosquitoes do not hatch and the nymphs and adults of many aquatic insects become dormant when the breeding ponds and marshes dry up. Insects have developed many methods of self-defense to avoid being devoured by their enemies. Flight, concealment, motion, armor and weapons, and even grotesqueness are some of these methods. Certain insects are specially adapted for hiding. Vast numbers hide beneath stones or the bark of trees. The flattened bodies of cockroaches and bedbugs enable them to disappear into narrow cracks. 


The most interesting means of concealment are   and  . The walkingstick looks like a twig. Certain moths blend so well into the bark of the tree on which they rest that they cannot be distinguished from the tree. Some harmless insects resemble stinging species in shape or color and so are avoided by predators. Certain moths and flies mimic bees. Armor and weapons are well developed in many insects. The tough, horny covering of the beetles amounts to a solid shell of armor. Sharp jaws and beaks, poisoned stingers, and spines serve as effective weapons. The extreme hairiness of some caterpillars makes birds and other predators avoid them, and in some caterpillars the hairs have venomous spines. Stink glands in some insects repel attackers in the same way as those in a skunk. When disturbed, the bombardier beetle ejects an irritating gas from its tail. The gas may be fired repeatedly and audibly. Grasshoppers exude a fluid popularly known as “tobacco juice.” The flavor of some insects is so bitter or sour that would-be predators avoid eating them. Insects are not able to reason. They are guided by instinct and by physiological reactions to their environment. Such reactions are called tropisms, from the Greek word  , meaning “turn.” All tropisms involve turning toward or away from a stimulus. Through chemotropism, chemical stimuli help insects find places to lay their eggs. The carrion beetle, for example, deposits eggs on decayed meat—drawn to it by odor. Butterflies and bees are attracted to flowers by odor as well as color. The scent glands of various insects help them attract a mate. Insects also avoid certain substances by chemotropic reactions. Clothes chests made of cedar or camphor wood have long been used for storing woolens and furs because these woods contain substances repellent to clothes moths. Many insects seem to be attracted to or repelled by light (phototropism). Moths are attracted to artificial light and moonlight but avoid sunlight. Butterflies react in the opposite way. Cockroaches in a dark room hide when a light is turned on.     Response to gravity (geotropism) may govern the way various boring insects react. Thermotropism, or attraction to heat, may draw parasites to their warm-blooded hosts. Thigmotropism is reaction to touch. Some insects avoid all contact with others; some thrive in close contact. The swarming of bees may be due to an attraction to one another’s bodies. Attraction to water (hydrotropism), adjustment to currents of streams (rheotropism), and adjustment to air currents (anemotropism) may explain the behavior of a wide variety of insects. However, no single stimulus governs all of their complex activities.   Insects belong to the phylum Arthropoda, one of the chief divisions of the   kingdom. The name comes from two Greek words,   (“joint”) and   (“foot”), and refers to the jointed feet. Arthropods also include spiders, lobsters, centipedes, and other animals. In this phylum, insects belong to the class Insecta. Each insect has two parts to its scientific name. For example, the housefly is   The first half of the name is that of the genus (a group of closely related species) to which the species   belongs. The many thousands of insect genera (plural of genus) are grouped under more than 900 families. These families, in turn, are grouped under as many as 30 orders. To summarize, the housefly is classified as follows: kingdom, Animalia; phylum, Arthropoda; class, Insecta (Hexapoda); order, Diptera; family, Muscidae; genus,  ; species,   Each of these groups is often divided even further into subgroups (subphylum, subclass, suborder, and so on). Insects appeared on Earth long before the advent of humans or the earliest mammals. The first insects probably evolved from primitive ringed worms. These insect ancestors were wingless and developed without metamorphosis, as do today’s silverfish. The oldest fossils of ancestral insect forms are believed to be some 350 million years old. There are also fossil records, from later eras, of highly developed forms very similar to the mayflies, cockroaches, and dragonflies now in existence. Some ancient insects were truly huge; dragonflies, for example, had a wingspread of 2 feet (0.61 meter) or more. Insects that attack humans or anything of value to humans are termed pests; many of these are mutually competitive with humans for the world’s food supply. Other insects are benefactors of humans, as they devour the carcasses of dead animals, pollinate orchards, manufacture honey, or simply serve as another link in the food chain of the animal kingdom, for humans eat the animals—including fish and birds—which, in turn, live upon the insects. 

About 10,000 species of insects have been classified as pests. Some are disease carriers, afflicting and often killing humans. Many insects prey upon domestic animals; others eat human food, clothing, and other possessions. Still others, in their quest for food or lodging, destroy trees, wood, and paper. 

As vectors, or transmitting agents, of disease organisms, insects have caused more deaths and have inflicted greater misery and hardship on humankind than all the wars of history. In their efforts to find food, insects wage their own war against the human race. Some feed upon humans directly. Notable among these are the true flies, including mosquitoes, horseflies, black flies, tsetse flies, and other two-winged pests. 

Perhaps humankind’s worst enemy among the insects is the mosquito. More lives have been lost as a result of malaria, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other mosquito-borne diseases than from all the other insect-borne diseases combined. The tsetse fly has been a serious deterrent to the development of much of tropical Africa, for the insect acts as a vector of trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness) among humans and of nagana, a serious disease of livestock. Horseflies and stable flies also transmit disease through their bites. The common housefly is not a biter, but it can carry myriad disease organisms on the hairs and the sticky secretions of its body. The assassin, or kissing, bug transmits the highly fatal Chagas’ disease. Bedbugs, fleas, and lice live on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. The human louse lives on the blood of humans alone and transmits typhus, relapsing fever, and trench fever.     The flea is potentially one of humankind’s deadliest enemies; rat fleas, for example, carry the germs of murine typhus and  , which wiped out about one-third of the population of Europe in four years in the mid-1300s.  

Insect pests in the home are most commonly chewers. One of the most troublesome of these—the clothes moth—attacks furs, woolens, and materials made of hair. The silverfish and the firebrat eat sized or stiffened material, such as the paper and bindings of books and starched clothing and curtains. In some parts of the United States, termites do considerable damage to furniture and paper products, as well as to the timber frameworks of buildings. 

Most insects are herbivorous—that is, they feed on plants. Virtually every part of a plant, from the flower to the root, is vulnerable to their attack. They do their damage in a variety of ways. Insects with chewing mouthparts are the most destructive plant eaters. A horde of grasshoppers, for example, can strip every blade of vegetation from a field in a few hours. The destruction caused by other chewing insects, such as beetles, can also be enormous. Insects with sucking mouthparts, though usually smaller and less conspicuous than the chewers, also do a great deal of damage to farm crops and to forest and garden plants. These insects pierce plant tissues and draw out the vital juices. These insects include the aphids, chinch bugs, cicadas, and scale insects. Damage is also done to the host plant from within by many other plant pests—usually as larvae. Some eat their way between the top and bottom layers of a leaf, giving it a blotched appearance. The leaf roller, the larval form of certain moths, rolls a leaf into a tube and spins silk to hold it together. The caterpillar then feeds on the leaf. Other insect pests tie several leaves together into a large nest. Gallflies cause swellings on buds, flowers, leaves, stems, bark, or roots of plants. Usually the female pierces the plant and lays an egg; the plant then grows a gall, or swelling, around the egg (   ). As long as a region is left in its natural state, no species of insect is likely to increase disproportionately in numbers. The balance of nature prevents this from happening. Every insect has natural enemies, such as the spider, the praying mantis, and many kinds of disease organisms, that help keep the number of insects down. The balance of nature in the New World was upset when settlers from Europe brought their domestic plants with them. Many insects that were harbored by these plants escaped the natural controls that were present in their old environments and became pests. The widespread use of such insecticides as DDT, now largely discontinued, also disrupted the balance of nature in some areas. Pests arrive in many ways and from many lands. The gypsy moth, for example, was brought to the United States for experiments in the 1860s. It escaped from the laboratory and before the end of the 19th century had cost millions of dollars annually in damage to shade trees. The Argentine ant, an enemy of field crops and stored foods, was a stowaway in a cargo that reached New Orleans, La., in 1891. The brown-tail moth, another shade-tree pest, reached New England from Europe in about 1897. The alfalfa weevil came to Utah in 1902 in soil adhering to imported plants. The corn borer was carried from southern Europe in 1909 in a shipment of broomcorn. Two serious pests came from Japan—the Oriental fruit moth, on cherry trees presented by the city of Tokyo to Washington, D.C., in 1913; and the Japanese beetle, on trees reaching New Jersey in 1916. Also in 1916, carloads of cottonseed from Mexico brought in the pink bollworm. Four arrived in 1920: the satin moth, an enemy of shade trees; the Asiatic beetle, which destroys lawns; the Mexican bean beetle, which feeds on a variety of beans; and the Mediterranean fruit fly, which is highly destructive of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Until the middle of the 19th century Americans were helpless against the growing insect menace. Finally, in the 1860s, arsenic compounds were found to be effective in combating the Colorado potato beetle. This was the first successful control of insect pests by scientific means. In the Morrill Act, in 1862, Congress provided for the study of insect pests and other agricultural problems. Six principal methods are used in the control of insect pests. These methods are chemical, mechanical, radiological, cultural, biological, and legal. The chemical substances used to destroy insects are called insecticides. These may be broadly classified as stomach poisons, contact poisons, fumigants, and sorptive dusts. The stomach poisons are more effective against the chewing insects; the contact poisons, against sucking insects. Fumigants are gaseous poisons that enter the insect’s breathing system. Sorptive dusts are dry chemical compounds that kill insects by absorbing fatty substances from the exoskeleton, thus causing vital body fluids to evaporate. Mechanical methods of insect control—often primitive and time-consuming—are generally less effective than chemical methods. They can seldom be applied practically to large populations of insects or over wide areas. These methods include swatting, the use of traps and barriers, water control, and temperature control. Water control involves adjustment of the water level or the rate of flow in breeding places. Temperature control is sometimes effective against insects that infest enclosed storage facilities. Reducing the temperature to 40° or 50°  F (4° or 10°  C) will cause most insects to become dormant; raising the temperature to 130°  F (54°  C) for three hours is sufficient to kill almost any insect. Perhaps the most dramatic, wholesale destruction of insects can be accomplished by making them infertile. Sexual sterility in male insects is induced by treating them with the rays of radioactive cobalt. If a large number of a particular species undergo this process in the laboratory, the treated males—though sterile—will still mate with fertile females; but the eggs laid by these females will be sterile. Following continual releases of sterile males in a single area, the number of young can be gradually reduced over a period of several generations until the population of the insect is totally wiped out within that area. Through this technique the screwfly, a serious pest of cattle, was first eradicated from the island of Curaçao in the West Indies in 1954. Radiological warfare was then used to bring the screwfly under control in the southeastern United States. The cultural control of insect pests is of special interest to the farmer. Methods include the destruction of plant residues and weeds, crop tillage, crop rotation, and the growing of insect-resistant strains of crops. When the farmer destroys the crop residues and weeds, he also destroys hibernating insects that would otherwise reproduce the following season. By plowing or cultivating at the right time of year, he can often eliminate large numbers of harmful insects living in the soil. Crop rotation is an important means of combating insect pests of field crops, for many such pests will feed on only a single species or a single family of plant. Thus, if a farmer grows a grain one season and a legume the next, populations of many grain pests (as well as legume pests) can be kept down or eliminated. Insect-resistant strains of many crops have been developed. Many of these strains have been developed by means of   techniques. Resistance to the European corn borer, the wireworm, and the chinch bug, for example, has been obtained in a single   hybrid through selective breeding. The control of insects by biological means involves the application of the pest’s natural enemies. These enemies may be microbes, mites, or other insects. Scientists have succeeded in controlling harmful insects by first determining the major predators or parasites of that insect in its country of origin. Then the scientists introduced these natural enemies as control agents in the new country that the pest had infested. A classic example is the cottony cushion scale, which threatened the survival of the California citrus industry in 1886. The predatory ladybird beetle, or vedalia beetle, was introduced from Australia, and within two years the scale insect had virtually disappeared from California. In eastern Canada in the early 1940s the vicious European spruce sawfly was completely controlled by the spontaneous appearance of a viral plant disease, perhaps unknowingly introduced from Europe. This event led to increased interest in plant diseases as potential means of pest control. The legal control of insects concerns government regulations to prevent the spread of insect pests from one country or region to another. The Federal Plant Quarantine Act of 1912 began the fight against imported pests by providing for inspectors at ports of entry. These officials examine all plant products as well as passengers’ baggage. Infested material is destroyed or thoroughly fumigated. Aircraft are examined and may be fumigated as soon as they arrive in the United States from countries where insect pests are a potential threat. By the time an immigrant pest is discovered in domestic plants, it is usually too late for eradication of the injurious insect. In some instances, however, control has been achieved. In 1929 the Mediterranean fruit fly was detected in Florida orchards; the insects threatened ruin to the fruit crop. State and federal entomologists united for battle, and all Florida was quarantined. Abandoned and rundown orchards were destroyed. Chemists developed new poison sprays. By the end of the summer not a “medfly” could be found in Florida. In 1956 a second such outbreak occurred; this too was put down after several months of intensive warfare. In 1981 a serious spread of the medfly threatened California’s agricultural regions with economic disaster. The pest had been imported accidentally in 1980. An attempt to control the insects by importing sterilized males from Peru failed. The Department of Agriculture threatened to quarantine the state’s produce unless the infected areas were fumigated. Governor Jerry Brown finally authorized helicopter spraying of the pesticide called malathion in July 1981. The spraying halted the threat to the California crops. (   .) 

Numerous species of plants depend upon insects to   them. In visiting   for nectar, insects carry pollen from one flower to the pistil of another. In this way they fertilize the plant and enable it to make seeds. Without insects there would be no orchard fruits or berries. Tomatoes, peas, onions, cabbages, and many other vegetables would not exist. There would be no clover or alfalfa. The animals that need these forage crops would be of poor quality, and humankind’s meat supply would suffer. There would be no linen or cotton; no tea, coffee, or chocolate. The honeybee produces honey and wax. Silk is made by the silkworm larva. Shellac is secreted by an Oriental scale insect. Such insects as the dobsonfly are used in sport fishing as bait. In many underdeveloped areas of the world grasshoppers, caterpillars, and other insects are necessary to humans as food. Insects are also important to humans as food for other animals. Freshwater fishes depend upon insects for food. Hundreds of species of birds would perish if there were no insects to eat. Insects have also played a significant role in the biological laboratory. The   fly, in particular, has been valuable in the study of inherited characteristics (   ). The European blister beetle, or Spanish fly, is helpful in the fight against human disease, for it secretes cantharidin, a substance used medically as a blistering agent. Many insects are invaluable as predators on insects that are pests to humans. In the same way, plant-eating insects are often valuable for their destruction of weeds. Insects that burrow in the earth improve the physical and chemical condition of the soil. As scavengers, insects perform the important function of eating dead plants and animals. The housefly, scorned as a disease carrier, is beneficial in its larval form—the maggot. It feeds on decaying refuse and in this way makes the world somewhat cleaner and more habitable for others.

After completing his studies at  , Ithaca, N.Y., under  , one of the leading entomologists of the time, Howard joined the Division of Entomology in the   and was appointed its head in 1894. He served in that   until 1927, during which time he came to be recognized as one of the world’s foremost authorities in his field. Howard gained distinction for his taxonomic work; he described 47 new genera of parasitic Hymenoptera (the order of insects that includes wasps and ants) and more than 20 species of mosquitoes, accomplishing the latter with the help of Harrison G. Dyar and Frederick Knab. Besides engaging in experimental work on the control of   pests, Howard conducted research in the area of medical entomology that resulted in the identification of the common housefly as a major carrier of diseases. He also was a   writer, publishing more than 1,000 scientific papers and books. Among his most significant writings were:   (1901);   (1911);   4 vol. (1912–17), written in collaboration with Dyar and Knab; and   (1930).

Content: From frogs that give birth through their mouths to crabs with 6-foot legs, these animals are some of the strangest you’ll hopefully never have to see. Besides just looking strange, these   are exposed to some pretty extreme environments. Discovered in 2010, the yeti crab ( ) lives in   near   that reach temperatures of up to 720 °F (380 °C). Their white coloring and strange hair patterns are thought to be adaptations to these extreme environments. The thermal vents, while ridiculously hot inside, are surrounded by freezing waters. This forces all the yeti crabs to cram themselves into a small area. (One marine biologist found 600 of these crabs in one vent!) Females, however, must venture into the dangerously cold waters to  , as the thermal vents are too high in   content for the crabs’ eggs to survive. The mother yeti crab rarely survives the cold water, usually dying of starvation after her children hatch. As for those hairy arms, they are a garden of sorts, growing bacteria that the crab then feeds on.  This insect may be only ¼ of an inch long, but do not be deceived: it packs quite a terrifying punch. The   ( ), despite its name, is actually a species of wasp. Because of high levels of  , males have wings but females do not, giving the females an antlike appearance. Velvet ants can be found in the hotter portions of the  . As if the existence of crawling wasps weren’t enough to warrant night terrors, these freakishly fuzzy insects can deliver enough poison in one sting to subdue a  —which weighs about 2,000 pounds, equivalent to 13 average-sized humans. Not only are the adult velvet ants terrifying, but even as   these bugs are nightmarish. When laying eggs, females seek out nests of other ground-dwelling insects. When the eggs hatch, the newborn velvet ants feed on the other insects’ larvae. Yikes! Red-lipped   ( ) are by no means dangerous, but they   clearly a product of an evolutionary nightmare. This aptly named sea creature is found on ocean floors 3–76 meters deep and is known best for its bright red lips and the difficulty it has when swimming. Yes, you read that right—a fish that has difficulty swimming. Its fins serve as “legs,” of sorts, on which the fish walks across the ocean floor. This striking red-lipped   of a fish is actually most likely a male—those red lips are thought to attract mates. I guess everyone has a type.  Okay, this   might not look all that grotesque, but it gives birth  . After the eggs are externally fertilized by a male, the female swallows her eggs. The eggs hatch as tadpoles in her stomach and grow until they become full-size frogs—and then mom regurgitates them up (ew!) over the span of a week. Unfortunately (or fortunately), these frogs went extinct in the 1980s. Scientists, however, are attempting to bring them back to life using a method of   called  , because who doesn’t love the idea of mouth-birthing Frankenstein frogs.  If you haven’t had nightmares about this guy already, you definitely will now. Named the “World’s Ugliest Animal” of 2013, the blobfish ( ) has made quite a splash (or maybe a flop) in the scientific and pop-cultural communities since its discovery in 2003. The blobfish is a gelatinous mass that floats above the ocean floor at depths of 600–1,200 meters. They have bones, but, because of the intense pressure they are exposed to at such depths, the bones are very soft and malleable. Since blobfish lack any substantial muscle, they feed only on   and other edible materials that happen to swim in front of their strange, strange mouths. Although these guys are absolutely ghastly looking on land and in observatories, their low-density flesh has led scientists to the understanding that they aren’t as, well, “blobby” when deep underwater. Their   tendencies may fascinate scientists, but to laypeople the blobfish is just unsettling. Talk about a face only a mother could love.  These massive creatures are absolutely spine-chilling…or, in their case,  -chilling. The   ( ) has a leg span of 10–12 feet. (That’s twice the height of an average human!) Clearly deserving of their name, these   resemble giant underwater spiders (yikes!) and feed on smaller crustaceans as well as plants. Japanese spider crabs were discovered in 1836 and are found mainly in waters surrounding the southern coast of  . They hang out at depths of 150–300 meters and are currently a subject of conservation efforts because of overfishing. They are actually considered a delicacy in many parts of Japan. Can you imagine ordering crab legs and being served one that’s six feet long?  Philippine tarsiers ( ), or really just   in general, are some of the strangest looking   mammals on Earth. With eyes that take up half of their head, tarsiers grow only to be the size of a human fist. Their heads can rotate 180 degrees—an evolutionary trait that surfaced in response to the fixation of their eyes in their head. They have powerful hind legs that allow them to jump up to three feet at a time. As suggested by the size of their optics, they have fantastic night vision—which at times results in their pupils covering the entirety of their eyes. There have been problems involving these fellows being illegally sold as pets. There’s a market for everything—even scary-looking mini-mammals.  At first glance, this   might not seem all that terrifying, but it is a giant  , four feet tall (some have been recorded as reaching five feet tall), that is known to eat turtles, fish, and young crocodiles. The shoebill ( ) has long thin legs as well as a disproportionately large head and bill. It lives in the swamps of eastern   and has been found to   its prey before consuming it. When shoebills have offspring, they focus their attention on only the eldest. Should two eggs hatch, the parents reject the younger hatchling, and in some cases the elder attempts siblicide (killing of a sibling). The younger offspring is theorized to function as a backup in case something happens to the elder. This is thought to be a form of energy conservation, but it seems just plain evil. Look at that nightmarish grin.  These   may appear to be just funny-looking cousins of the terrifying crocs we are more familiar with. However, their disproportionately long jaws are lined with 110 razor-sharp teeth. That’s 30 more than the typical crocodile, and their teeth are much sharper.   ( ) can grow to be 20 feet long and can weigh up to 350 pounds. They are found in   and  , specifically in major northern river systems. Males exhibit a   trait atop the end of their snout called a   (after a type of Indian pottery), from which the crocodile gets its name. These massive creatures don’t attack humans but will feed on corpses set afloat during funeral ceremonies.  We’ll finish this unnerving list with what might be the most underrated nightmare-dwelling animal alive. The star-nosed   ( ) can be found in wet low areas, typically in eastern   and the northeastern  . Its main claim to fame is its strange pink fleshy ring around the snout, called the  . The star is jam-packed with nerve fibers and functions similar to our eyes: it paints a picture of the mole’s surroundings by using its keen sense of touch. The giant claws are used for digging tunnels beneath swamps—the mole’s primary habitat. The star-nosed mole is also considered the fastest eating   on Earth, consuming insects in less than 0.2 second. These guys are pretty interesting, but they still look like hairy aliens.

(baptized Feb. 12, 1637, Amsterdam—died Feb. 15, 1680, Amsterdam) was a Dutch naturalist, considered the most accurate of classical microscopists, who was the first to observe and describe red blood cells (1658). Swammerdam completed medical studies in 1667 but never practiced medicine, devoting himself to microscopical investigations instead. Turning to the study of insects, he accurately described and illustrated the life histories and   of many species. His observations of their development led him to separate insects into four major divisions, according to the degree and type of  . Three of these divisions have been more or less retained in modern classification. During the period he devoted to exhaustive entomological research (1667–73), he completed   popularly recognized as a major work at the time, and the   one of the finest collections of microscopical observations ever published. In these works he corrected the physiologist     of the   brain and   and opposed the physician   inconsistent interpretation of insect  . He also demonstrated the presence of   wings in caterpillars about to undergo pupation. Studying the anatomy of the tadpole and the adult frog, he noted a cleavage in the egg and discovered valves in the lymphatic vessels, now known as  Swammerdam valves. He described the ovarian follicles of mammals in the same year as the physician   (1672) and devised improved techniques for injecting wax and dyes into cadavers, which had important consequences for the study of human anatomy. His ingenious experiments showed that muscles alter in shape but not in size during contraction, contradicting the classic Greek physician   popular theory that a material fluid passing through the nerves is responsible for the movement. After his father refused to continue his financial support, Swammerdam suffered extreme privations. Subject in the last years of his life to fits of depression, he sought relief by becoming a   of the religious enthusiast  .

(born April 17, 1899, Kirkham, Lancashire, Eng.—died  Feb. 11, 1994,  , Cambridgeshire) was an  English entomologist, noted for his contribution to the study of    . His investigations of the living insect body and its tissues and organs revealed much about the   complexity of individual insects and their interactions with the  . His   (1934) is often considered the foundation for this branch of  . After   in France during  , Wigglesworth completed his education at the   and   Hospital in London. He lectured in medical entomology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and later was reader in entomology first at the  , then at Cambridge. In 1943 he was appointed director of the Agricultural Research Council Unit of Insect Physiology in Cambridge. He was knighted in 1964. Among Wigglesworth’s most significant discoveries were those concerned with  , particularly the control of form and growth. In insects such as the South American blood-sucking bug   Wigglesworth was able to determine that a crucial   was produced in the neurosecretory cells of its brain, the first experimental demonstration of the function of such cells. He then discovered another hormone that actually prevented the development of adult characteristics in   until the insect had reached the appropriate larval stage. Wigglesworth found that this hormone, which he called the  , was produced in the region of the endocrine gland known as the corpus allatum. He found that he could radically distort the developmental phases of his insect subjects by a selective manipulation of their hormonal levels. Finally, Wigglesworth was thus able to formulate a   theory of insect   involving the selective activation by hormones of the insect’s genetic components, which in turn determine its   and developmental character. Besides making these discoveries, Wigglesworth isolated the properties of various insect enzymes and the mechanism for the hatching of insect eggs.

The abdomen is attached to the thorax by a slender petiole, or “waist,” and the female’s abdomen has a formidable stinger. Most species are solitary; about 1,000 species are highly social; and some may be either social or solitary. Adults feed primarily on nectar. Most solitary wasps nest in tunnels in the ground and feed larvae with paralyzed insects or spiders. The paperlike nest of social wasps (family Vespidae) consists of chewed plant material mixed with saliva and arranged in adjacent hexagonal cells. The female lays one egg in each cell and provisions it with a macerated caterpillar. Successive generations may enlarge the nest and care for the young.

Anna Botsford entered   in Ithaca,  , in 1874, but she left after two years. In 1878 she married  , a young entomologist on the Cornell   who interested her in   illustration. Throughout their marriage she functioned as his assistant, illustrating his lectures and publications on insects. Her work was usually on an informal, unpaid basis, but when he was chief entomologist in the   (1879–81), she received a formal appointment. There she prepared the drawings for his   (on citrus scale insects) of 1880. She then reentered Cornell and took a degree in natural history in 1885. Thereafter she studied   at  ,  , in order to prepare illustrations for her husband’s   (1888), and in 1888 she was one of the first four women admitted to Sigma Xi, a national honour society for the sciences. Comstock made engravings for the more than 600 plates in her husband’s   (1895) and for   (1897) and   (1904), both of which she co-authored. Her engravings were also widely exhibited and won several prizes. Books that she both wrote and illustrated include   (1903),   (1905),   (1911, with more than two dozen editions),   (1914), and   (1916). In 1895 Comstock was appointed to the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture, under whose   she planned and conducted an experimental course of nature study for public schools. When the program was approved for statewide use through the extension service of Cornell, she wrote and spoke in its behalf, helped train teachers, and prepared classroom materials; from 1897 she taught nature study at Cornell. Comstock lectured frequently to teachers’ and farmers’ institutes and at universities. She was editor of   (1917–1923) and was on the staff of  . She also wrote a novel,   (1906). In 1922 she retired from Cornell as professor emerita but continued to teach in the summer session.

Content: The insects are the largest group of  . In fact, about 75 percent of all animals are insects. Insects developed on Earth long before humans did. Today there are about 1 million known species, or types, of insect. And scientists are constantly discovering new species. Butterflies, beetles, ants, flies, grasshoppers, silverfish, and bees are all insects. Insects live all over the world. They can survive in almost any place where food is available. For instance, insects can be found in cold regions, hot rain forests, deserts, mountains, caves, and freshwater. A few kinds even live in salt water. Insects are members of a larger group called the arthropods. This group also includes spiders, ticks, centipedes, lobsters, and crabs. Like all arthropods, insects have a body that is divided into segments, or sections. They also lack a skeleton inside the body. Instead, insects and other arthropods have a covering on the outside of the body called an exoskeleton. This exoskeleton protects the body. Unlike other arthropods, insects have three major body segments. Insects also have six legs. This is one way that insects differ from spiders, which have eight legs. Insects also have at least one pair of antennas, or feelers. The three major segments of an insect body are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The head contains the insect’s antennas, mouthparts, and eyes. The adults of many species have two kinds of eyes, simple and compound. Compound eyes have many lenslike parts. Each of these receives a separate image. The images are combined into a single picture in the insect’s brain. The thorax has three pairs of legs and usually two pairs of wings. But some insects have only one pair of wings or no wings at all. The abdomen is made up of as many as 11 segments. It contains organs that digest food, push out wastes, and help the insect reproduce. Insects vary greatly in size. Most insects are small, usually less than 0.2 inch (6 millimeters) long. However, some insects called walkingsticks can grow to more than 12 inches (30 centimeters) long. Insects have a variety of ways to protect themselves from their enemies. For example, some insects hide by blending in to their surroundings. Many moths have a similar   to the bark of the trees on which they rest. Beetles have a very hard body armor to protect them. Some insects bite or sting their enemies. Some kinds produce poison. Some kinds of insects live alone, while others live in groups. Termites, ants, and some bees and wasps live in very organized groups. Each individual has a particular job to do for the group. For example, some termites are born to be soldiers or workers. Other termites will be the king and queen. Insects eat a great variety of plants, animals, and other living things. Certain insects, such as fleas and lice, live on the body of another animal. They get all their food from that animal’s body. Such insects are called  . Most insects hatch from eggs. A few kinds are born live. An insect’s exoskeleton cannot grow. Instead, as the insect grows, this covering splits apart and falls off from time to time. The insect grows a new covering. This process is called molting. There are two basic life cycles found in insects. Some insects are born in nearly the same form they will have as an adult. The insect grows and molts, eventually becoming an adult. Grasshoppers and cockroaches go through this kind of growth process. Other types undergo a complete change, or  . After they hatch, they begin life in a form called a larva. It is completely unlike the adult form. For instance, a larva may look more like a worm than an insect. The larva eats a great deal and molts several times. It then enters a resting stage in a form called a pupa. The pupa’s body changes greatly during this stage. It develops all of the features of the adult, including wings and legs. When this stage is complete, the adult emerges from the pupa. Bees, butterflies, and moths are some insects that develop this way. Many insects are helpful to humans and other animals. Some kinds eat other insects that are pests. Insects are also food for other animals. Some insects produce valuable products such as honey, silk, and dyes. Many flowering plants depend on insects such as bees to help them reproduce. As insects feed on flowers, they spread a substance called   from the male parts of flowers to the female parts. This allows the female parts to make seeds. Insects can also be pests. Some insects sting or bite people or other animals. Many insects can spread diseases to people, other animals, and plants. And some harmful insects eat crops, wood, clothing, and carpet.

Cicadas are found in tropical and temperate areas worldwide and occur in  ,  , and  . Cicadas have long been used in folk medicines, as religious and   symbols, and as an important source of food for humans and many other organisms. The cicada appears in the mythology, literature, and music of many  , including those of some   peoples in the Americas, and the males of certain Asian species have even been kept in cages for their melodious songs.   . Cicadas are medium to large insects, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm (0.8 to 2 inches). They characteristically have short antennae, two pairs of transparent membranous wings, prominent   eyes, and three simple eyes (ocelli) that form a triangle between the compound eyes. The insects do not bite or sting. Major species are generally easily recognized by differences in songs, behavior, and  . The shrill thorntree cicada ( ), found in Africa, is thought to be the loudest insect in the world. Exceeding 106 decibels, the males’ songs are nearly as loud as a chainsaw (110 decibels). Male cicadas produce loud noises by vibrating membranes ( ) near the base of the  . Males of each species typically have three distinct  : a congregational song that is regulated by daily weather fluctuations and by songs produced by other males; a courtship song, usually produced prior to copulation; and a disturbance squawk, produced by individuals captured, held, or disturbed into flight. Most North American cicadas produce rhythmical ticks, buzzes,  , or screams, although in some species the song is musical. Females lack tymbals, though some species use their wings to produce clicking or snapping sounds, often in response to the songs of the males. All cicada species have a life cycle that consists of three stages: egg,  , and adult. Adult female cicadas usually lay their eggs in woody plant tissues. Newly hatched   burrow into the ground where they suck juices from roots of   plants. Nymphs usually undergo five molts during the year or more required to reach maturity. When prompted to emerge—the biology of which is not well understood for long-lived species—mature nymphs often appear aboveground en masse and undergo their final molt on nearby trees. The winged adults live for only a few weeks, just long enough to find a mate and lay eggs. Although not ordinarily considered a pest, the females, if numerous, may damage young saplings during their egg laying. A large and   group, the cicada family   more than 500 genera worldwide. The   ( ) are among the most fascinating and best-known cicadas. The genus contains seven North American species of    (often erroneously called 17-year locusts) and . In what are among the longest life cycles of any insects, periodical cicadas emerge in spring only every 13 or 17 years, with millions of insects materializing from the soil in a matter of weeks and dying shortly thereafter. These species occur in chronologically and geographically isolated broods. To distinguish them from the periodical cicadas, a number of North American species are known as annual cicadas. These are seen every summer, though their   typically span 2–5 years. Annual cicadas include the  dog-day cicadas (genus  ), scrub cicadas (genus  ), several species of the genus  , and members of the genus  . The nearly 60 species of the genus   are found in Europe, the  , and parts of Africa. The common, or  , cicada ( ) is one of the most familiar species in Europe. The   cicada ( ) is the only cicada native to the United Kingdom, where it is considered an  . The largest cicadas in the world are found in Asia. Members of the genus   are large-bodied insects native to  . Included is the empress cicada ( ), the most massive of all known cicada species, with a superlative body length of about 7 cm (2.8 inches). The only member of its genus,   can reach more than 5.5 cm (2 inches) in length. The insect is unusual in that its wings are   instead of transparent like those of other cicada species.

Adults of most of the approximately 600 species of gall wasps that occur in   are about 6 to 8 mm (about 0.25 to 0.30 inch) long and black. The shiny   is oval, and the thorax has a sculptured appearance. A given species of   wasp will cause a characteristic type of gall to form on a certain part of a particular species of  . Many of these wasps attack   trees or   plants. Male gall wasps are rare, and reproduction usually occurs by   (i.e., larvae develop from unfertilized eggs). The egg passes through the long ovipositor of the female and into the plant tissue. After the egg hatches into a larva, it begins to secrete materials that cause the plant tissues around it to begin to grow faster than normal. The gall increases in size as the larva grows. The larva feeds on the plant tissue within the gall and pupates and transforms into an adult within the gall. The so-called  oak apple, a round, spongy, fruitlike object about 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) in  , is caused by the larvae of the gall wasp   About 30 such larvae may develop in a single “apple,” or gall.

Human fascination with   behaviour probably extends back millions of years, perhaps even to times before the ancestors of the species became human in the modern sense. Initially, animals were probably observed for practical reasons because early human survival depended on knowledge of animal behaviour. Whether hunting wild game, keeping domesticated animals, or escaping an attacking  , success required   knowledge of an animal’s habits. Even today, information about animal behaviour is of considerable importance. For example, in Britain, studies on the social organization and the ranging patterns of   ( ) have helped reduce the spread of   among cattle, and studies of sociality in   ( ) assist in the development of models that predict how quickly rabies would spread should it ever cross the  .

British ethologist   and American field biologist George Schaller, as well as British broadcaster   and Australian wildlife conservationist  , have brought the wonders of animal behaviour to the attention and appreciation of the general public.

Content: From frogs that give birth through their mouths to crabs with 6-foot legs, these animals are some of the strangest you’ll hopefully never have to see. Besides just looking strange, these   are exposed to some pretty extreme environments. Discovered in 2010, the yeti crab ( ) lives in   near   that reach temperatures of up to 720 °F (380 °C). Their white coloring and strange hair patterns are thought to be adaptations to these extreme environments. The thermal vents, while ridiculously hot inside, are surrounded by freezing waters. This forces all the yeti crabs to cram themselves into a small area. (One marine biologist found 600 of these crabs in one vent!) Females, however, must venture into the dangerously cold waters to  , as the thermal vents are too high in   content for the crabs’ eggs to survive. The mother yeti crab rarely survives the cold water, usually dying of starvation after her children hatch. As for those hairy arms, they are a garden of sorts, growing bacteria that the crab then feeds on.  This insect may be only ¼ of an inch long, but do not be deceived: it packs quite a terrifying punch. The   ( ), despite its name, is actually a species of wasp. Because of high levels of  , males have wings but females do not, giving the females an antlike appearance. Velvet ants can be found in the hotter portions of the  . As if the existence of crawling wasps weren’t enough to warrant night terrors, these freakishly fuzzy insects can deliver enough poison in one sting to subdue a  —which weighs about 2,000 pounds, equivalent to 13 average-sized humans. Not only are the adult velvet ants terrifying, but even as   these bugs are nightmarish. When laying eggs, females seek out nests of other ground-dwelling insects. When the eggs hatch, the newborn velvet ants feed on the other insects’ larvae. Yikes! Red-lipped   ( ) are by no means dangerous, but they   clearly a product of an evolutionary nightmare. This aptly named sea creature is found on ocean floors 3–76 meters deep and is known best for its bright red lips and the difficulty it has when swimming. Yes, you read that right—a fish that has difficulty swimming. Its fins serve as “legs,” of sorts, on which the fish walks across the ocean floor. This striking red-lipped   of a fish is actually most likely a male—those red lips are thought to attract mates. I guess everyone has a type.  Okay, this   might not look all that grotesque, but it gives birth  . After the eggs are externally fertilized by a male, the female swallows her eggs. The eggs hatch as tadpoles in her stomach and grow until they become full-size frogs—and then mom regurgitates them up (ew!) over the span of a week. Unfortunately (or fortunately), these frogs went extinct in the 1980s. Scientists, however, are attempting to bring them back to life using a method of   called  , because who doesn’t love the idea of mouth-birthing Frankenstein frogs.  If you haven’t had nightmares about this guy already, you definitely will now. Named the “World’s Ugliest Animal” of 2013, the blobfish ( ) has made quite a splash (or maybe a flop) in the scientific and pop-cultural communities since its discovery in 2003. The blobfish is a gelatinous mass that floats above the ocean floor at depths of 600–1,200 meters. They have bones, but, because of the intense pressure they are exposed to at such depths, the bones are very soft and malleable. Since blobfish lack any substantial muscle, they feed only on   and other edible materials that happen to swim in front of their strange, strange mouths. Although these guys are absolutely ghastly looking on land and in observatories, their low-density flesh has led scientists to the understanding that they aren’t as, well, “blobby” when deep underwater. Their   tendencies may fascinate scientists, but to laypeople the blobfish is just unsettling. Talk about a face only a mother could love.  These massive creatures are absolutely spine-chilling…or, in their case,  -chilling. The   ( ) has a leg span of 10–12 feet. (That’s twice the height of an average human!) Clearly deserving of their name, these   resemble giant underwater spiders (yikes!) and feed on smaller crustaceans as well as plants. Japanese spider crabs were discovered in 1836 and are found mainly in waters surrounding the southern coast of  . They hang out at depths of 150–300 meters and are currently a subject of conservation efforts because of overfishing. They are actually considered a delicacy in many parts of Japan. Can you imagine ordering crab legs and being served one that’s six feet long?  Philippine tarsiers ( ), or really just   in general, are some of the strangest looking   mammals on Earth. With eyes that take up half of their head, tarsiers grow only to be the size of a human fist. Their heads can rotate 180 degrees—an evolutionary trait that surfaced in response to the fixation of their eyes in their head. They have powerful hind legs that allow them to jump up to three feet at a time. As suggested by the size of their optics, they have fantastic night vision—which at times results in their pupils covering the entirety of their eyes. There have been problems involving these fellows being illegally sold as pets. There’s a market for everything—even scary-looking mini-mammals.  At first glance, this   might not seem all that terrifying, but it is a giant  , four feet tall (some have been recorded as reaching five feet tall), that is known to eat turtles, fish, and young crocodiles. The shoebill ( ) has long thin legs as well as a disproportionately large head and bill. It lives in the swamps of eastern   and has been found to   its prey before consuming it. When shoebills have offspring, they focus their attention on only the eldest. Should two eggs hatch, the parents reject the younger hatchling, and in some cases the elder attempts siblicide (killing of a sibling). The younger offspring is theorized to function as a backup in case something happens to the elder. This is thought to be a form of energy conservation, but it seems just plain evil. Look at that nightmarish grin.  These   may appear to be just funny-looking cousins of the terrifying crocs we are more familiar with. However, their disproportionately long jaws are lined with 110 razor-sharp teeth. That’s 30 more than the typical crocodile, and their teeth are much sharper.   ( ) can grow to be 20 feet long and can weigh up to 350 pounds. They are found in   and  , specifically in major northern river systems. Males exhibit a   trait atop the end of their snout called a   (after a type of Indian pottery), from which the crocodile gets its name. These massive creatures don’t attack humans but will feed on corpses set afloat during funeral ceremonies.  We’ll finish this unnerving list with what might be the most underrated nightmare-dwelling animal alive. The star-nosed   ( ) can be found in wet low areas, typically in eastern   and the northeastern  . Its main claim to fame is its strange pink fleshy ring around the snout, called the  . The star is jam-packed with nerve fibers and functions similar to our eyes: it paints a picture of the mole’s surroundings by using its keen sense of touch. The giant claws are used for digging tunnels beneath swamps—the mole’s primary habitat. The star-nosed mole is also considered the fastest eating   on Earth, consuming insects in less than 0.2 second. These guys are pretty interesting, but they still look like hairy aliens.

Content: The insects are the largest group of  . In fact, about 75 percent of all animals are insects. Insects developed on Earth long before humans did. Today there are about 1 million known species, or types, of insect. And scientists are constantly discovering new species. Butterflies, beetles, ants, flies, grasshoppers, silverfish, and bees are all insects. Insects live all over the world. They can survive in almost any place where food is available. For instance, insects can be found in cold regions, hot rain forests, deserts, mountains, caves, and freshwater. A few kinds even live in salt water. Insects are members of a larger group called the arthropods. This group also includes spiders, ticks, centipedes, lobsters, and crabs. Like all arthropods, insects have a body that is divided into segments, or sections. They also lack a skeleton inside the body. Instead, insects and other arthropods have a covering on the outside of the body called an exoskeleton. This exoskeleton protects the body. Unlike other arthropods, insects have three major body segments. Insects also have six legs. This is one way that insects differ from spiders, which have eight legs. Insects also have at least one pair of antennas, or feelers. The three major segments of an insect body are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The head contains the insect’s antennas, mouthparts, and eyes. The adults of many species have two kinds of eyes, simple and compound. Compound eyes have many lenslike parts. Each of these receives a separate image. The images are combined into a single picture in the insect’s brain. The thorax has three pairs of legs and usually two pairs of wings. But some insects have only one pair of wings or no wings at all. The abdomen is made up of as many as 11 segments. It contains organs that digest food, push out wastes, and help the insect reproduce. Insects vary greatly in size. Most insects are small, usually less than 0.2 inch (6 millimeters) long. However, some insects called walkingsticks can grow to more than 12 inches (30 centimeters) long. Insects have a variety of ways to protect themselves from their enemies. For example, some insects hide by blending in to their surroundings. Many moths have a similar   to the bark of the trees on which they rest. Beetles have a very hard body armor to protect them. Some insects bite or sting their enemies. Some kinds produce poison. Some kinds of insects live alone, while others live in groups. Termites, ants, and some bees and wasps live in very organized groups. Each individual has a particular job to do for the group. For example, some termites are born to be soldiers or workers. Other termites will be the king and queen. Insects eat a great variety of plants, animals, and other living things. Certain insects, such as fleas and lice, live on the body of another animal. They get all their food from that animal’s body. Such insects are called  . Most insects hatch from eggs. A few kinds are born live. An insect’s exoskeleton cannot grow. Instead, as the insect grows, this covering splits apart and falls off from time to time. The insect grows a new covering. This process is called molting. There are two basic life cycles found in insects. Some insects are born in nearly the same form they will have as an adult. The insect grows and molts, eventually becoming an adult. Grasshoppers and cockroaches go through this kind of growth process. Other types undergo a complete change, or  . After they hatch, they begin life in a form called a larva. It is completely unlike the adult form. For instance, a larva may look more like a worm than an insect. The larva eats a great deal and molts several times. It then enters a resting stage in a form called a pupa. The pupa’s body changes greatly during this stage. It develops all of the features of the adult, including wings and legs. When this stage is complete, the adult emerges from the pupa. Bees, butterflies, and moths are some insects that develop this way. Many insects are helpful to humans and other animals. Some kinds eat other insects that are pests. Insects are also food for other animals. Some insects produce valuable products such as honey, silk, and dyes. Many flowering plants depend on insects such as bees to help them reproduce. As insects feed on flowers, they spread a substance called   from the male parts of flowers to the female parts. This allows the female parts to make seeds. Insects can also be pests. Some insects sting or bite people or other animals. Many insects can spread diseases to people, other animals, and plants. And some harmful insects eat crops, wood, clothing, and carpet.

Content: ,  Any of more than 20,000, usually winged, insect species in the order Hymenoptera. The abdomen is attached to the thorax by a slender petiole, or “waist,” and the female’s abdomen has a formidable stinger. Most species are solitary; about 1,000 species are highly social; and some may be either social or solitary. Adults feed primarily on nectar. Most solitary wasps nest in tunnels in the ground and feed larvae with paralyzed insects or spiders. The paperlike nest of social wasps (family Vespidae) consists of chewed plant material mixed with saliva and arranged in adjacent hexagonal cells. The female lays one egg in each cell and provisions it with a macerated caterpillar. Successive generations may enlarge the nest and care for the young.

Echolocation is used for orientation, obstacle avoidance, food procurement, and social interactions. Echolocation is known to be employed by most bats (all members of the suborder Microchiroptera and one  ,   of the Megachiroptera); most, if not all,   and porpoises (Odontoceti), but apparently no baleen whales; a few shrews; and two kinds of birds, the   ( ) of northern   and certain cave   ( ) of  . Echolocation pulses consist of short bursts of sound at frequencies ranging from about 1,000 hertz in birds to at least 200,000 hertz in whales. Bats utilize frequencies from as low as 11,000 hertz (e.g., the  European free-tailed bat [ ]) to as high as 212,000 hertz (e.g.,  Percival’s trident bat [ ]). The pulses are repeated at varying rates (often in a single individual, depending upon the situation), beginning at about one per second. The rate may reach several hundred per second (e.g., in a bat close to its target). In microchiropteran bats and some toothed whales, a mutated form of a protein called  prestin increases their sensitivity to high-frequency sounds and thereby   the detection of return echoes. The nearly identical molecular structure of the   gene in these animals, which differs from the structure of the   gene found in all other mammals, is an example of convergent evolution, in which the two groups independently evolved the same form of the echolocating protein in response to similar environmental pressures.

Cicadas are found in tropical and temperate areas worldwide and occur in  ,  , and  . Cicadas have long been used in folk medicines, as religious and   symbols, and as an important source of food for humans and many other organisms. The cicada appears in the mythology, literature, and music of many  , including those of some   peoples in the Americas, and the males of certain Asian species have even been kept in cages for their melodious songs.   . Cicadas are medium to large insects, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm (0.8 to 2 inches). They characteristically have short antennae, two pairs of transparent membranous wings, prominent   eyes, and three simple eyes (ocelli) that form a triangle between the compound eyes. The insects do not bite or sting. Major species are generally easily recognized by differences in songs, behavior, and  . The shrill thorntree cicada ( ), found in Africa, is thought to be the loudest insect in the world. Exceeding 106 decibels, the males’ songs are nearly as loud as a chainsaw (110 decibels). Male cicadas produce loud noises by vibrating membranes ( ) near the base of the  . Males of each species typically have three distinct  : a congregational song that is regulated by daily weather fluctuations and by songs produced by other males; a courtship song, usually produced prior to copulation; and a disturbance squawk, produced by individuals captured, held, or disturbed into flight. Most North American cicadas produce rhythmical ticks, buzzes,  , or screams, although in some species the song is musical. Females lack tymbals, though some species use their wings to produce clicking or snapping sounds, often in response to the songs of the males. All cicada species have a life cycle that consists of three stages: egg,  , and adult. Adult female cicadas usually lay their eggs in woody plant tissues. Newly hatched   burrow into the ground where they suck juices from roots of   plants. Nymphs usually undergo five molts during the year or more required to reach maturity. When prompted to emerge—the biology of which is not well understood for long-lived species—mature nymphs often appear aboveground en masse and undergo their final molt on nearby trees. The winged adults live for only a few weeks, just long enough to find a mate and lay eggs. Although not ordinarily considered a pest, the females, if numerous, may damage young saplings during their egg laying. A large and   group, the cicada family   more than 500 genera worldwide. The   ( ) are among the most fascinating and best-known cicadas. The genus contains seven North American species of    (often erroneously called 17-year locusts) and . In what are among the longest life cycles of any insects, periodical cicadas emerge in spring only every 13 or 17 years, with millions of insects materializing from the soil in a matter of weeks and dying shortly thereafter. These species occur in chronologically and geographically isolated broods. To distinguish them from the periodical cicadas, a number of North American species are known as annual cicadas. These are seen every summer, though their   typically span 2–5 years. Annual cicadas include the  dog-day cicadas (genus  ), scrub cicadas (genus  ), several species of the genus  , and members of the genus  . The nearly 60 species of the genus   are found in Europe, the  , and parts of Africa. The common, or  , cicada ( ) is one of the most familiar species in Europe.

Echolocation pulses consist of short bursts of sound at frequencies ranging from about 1,000 hertz in birds to at least 200,000 hertz in whales. Bats utilize frequencies from as low as 11,000 hertz (e.g., the  European free-tailed bat [ ]) to as high as 212,000 hertz (e.g.,  Percival’s trident bat [ ]). The pulses are repeated at varying rates (often in a single individual, depending upon the situation), beginning at about one per second. The rate may reach several hundred per second (e.g., in a bat close to its target). In microchiropteran bats and some toothed whales, a mutated form of a protein called  prestin increases their sensitivity to high-frequency sounds and thereby   the detection of return echoes. The nearly identical molecular structure of the   gene in these animals, which differs from the structure of the   gene found in all other mammals, is an example of convergent evolution, in which the two groups independently evolved the same form of the echolocating protein in response to similar environmental pressures.

It occurs commonly among lower   and     (particularly  ,  ,  ,  , and  ) and rarely among higher  . An   produced parthenogenetically may be either haploid (i.e., with one set of dissimilar  ) or diploid (i.e., with a paired set of chromosomes). Parthenogenic species may be   (that is, incapable of  ) or facultative (that is, capable of switching between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction depending upon environmental conditions). The term   is taken from the Greek words  , meaning “virgin,” and  , meaning “origin.” More than 2,000 species are thought to reproduce parthenogenically. Parthenogenesis is sometimes considered to be an asexual form of reproduction; however, it may be more accurately described as an “incomplete form of sexual reproduction,” since offspring of parthenogenic species develop from gametes. Gametes are reproductive cells that result from meiosis (or reduction division)—in which a specialized cell with a (diploid) double set of chromosomes undergoes two fissions of its  . Meiosis gives rise to four gametes, or sex cells, which are haploid—in that each possesses half the number of chromosomes of the original cell (   ). Parthenogenesis can operate on either a haploid or a diploid cell. In haploid parthenogenesis, a rare form of parthenogenesis that occurs in a few species of bees, nematodes, and plants,   develop from haploid eggs to produce haploid adults. On the other hand, the process of diploid parthenogenesis, a more common and varied form of the phenomenon, may proceed along two pathways. Automixis (automictic parthenogenesis) is a postmeiotic process in which a haploid cell may either duplicate its chromosomes or join with another haploid cell. In both cases, diploid zygotes develop and grow into diploid adults. Such organisms are not true clones of the mother, however, because the meiotic process separates and recombines the genetic material. A second form of diploid parthenogenesis,   (apomicitic parthenogenesis), forgoes complete meiosis altogether. Instead, two genetically identical diploid egg cells are produced from a parent cell through   (the process of cell duplication), and one or more of these daughter cells, which are both diploid and   (that is, genetically identical) of the original parent cell, develop into a diploid offspring. Diploid parthenogenesis occurs in insects such as aphids as well as in some rotifers and flowering plants (    and  ). In the insect order   (which includes bees, wasps, and ants), parthenogenesis can take one of three forms: arrhenotoky, thelytoky, and deuterotoky. In arrhenotoky, haploid males are produced from unfertilized eggs laid by mated (impregnated) females or by so-called secondary, or supplementary, queens, which have not been impregnated. In thelytoky, which occurs in many species of the suborder Symphyta (a group that includes the  , the  , and the  ), unmated females produce males. In deuterotoky, unmated females of some Symphyta produce females as well as males. The occurrence of these forms is not always mutually  . For example, in   (bees), about 1 percent of the eggs laid by secondary queens may be female. Sometimes associated with arrhenotoky, thelytoky, and deuterotoky is pseudoarrhenotoky (or paternal genome elimination). Pseudoarrhenotoky is a nonparthenogenic form of   that occurs in the hymenopteran superfamily Chalcidoidea (a group of small parasitic wasps) and in some mites, Like arrhenotoky, pseudoarrhenotoky results in the production of haploid males. In this process, development begins as diploid organisms within fertilized eggs; however, as development progresses, males become haploid after the paternal contribution to the genome has been lost, eliminated, or deactivated. A number of parthenogenic variations have been observed. Some aphids and    undergo a type of parthenogenesis called heterogony or cyclic parthenogenesis. In these species, generations of offspring produced from fertilized eggs may alternate with those produced from unfertilized ones. Such an   in both groups of insects is thought to result partly from seasonal temperature changes, with eggs produced through sexual reproduction having a greater ability to withstand the winter cold. They lie dormant until temperatures rise.

The skippers are a worldwide group intermediate between butterflies and moths. With the exception of a few moths, all adult lepidopterans have two pairs of wings. The name Lepidoptera is derived from the Greek, meaning “scaly winged,” and refers to the characteristic covering of microscopic dustlike   on the wings. The life cycle of lepidopterans consists of four stages:  ,   ( ),   (chrysalis), and adult (imago). The larvae do most of the eating, with the majority feeding on foliage, although many species eat  ,  ,  , or  . A number of moth and a few   larvae are serious   in agriculture and forestry. The adults of many species are important for their role in  , which occurs as they visit flowers for  . In most land   the lepidopterans are ecologically important because they transform large amounts of   matter into   matter and in turn serve as food for many other groups of animals. Many members of the order, especially the butterflies, have appealed to the human imagination for thousands of years as   of fragile and   beauty. References to them abound in literature, and they have been depicted in many paintings, have inspired the designs of  , ornaments, and  , and have even occurred in many heraldic devices and on postage stamps. Moths, butterflies, and skippers show great   in size and development rates. Some moths have wingspans as small as 4 mm (0.13 inch), whereas the largest moths and butterflies measure nearly 30 cm (about 1 foot). Fast-developing species may complete their development in as little as three weeks, while slower ones may require as long as two or even three years. Lepidopterans live on every continent except  . Though they are far more numerous and diversified in the tropics, some species survive at the limits of polar vegetation. There are many successful species in nearly every  , from arid   and high mountaintops to   and tropical  . Most have become adapted for life in relatively restricted ecological   and may be limited to only one or a small group of food plants, often to only a single part of one plant. They are therefore seldom abundant in more than one type of  . However, a few species have broader food habits and may occasionally reach peaks of abnormal abundance and defoliate large areas of deciduous   or  . Some of the insects most injurious to human interests in agriculture and forestry are members of the Lepidoptera. The large family-level groups and many smaller ones are   in distribution, with   (family Noctuidae),   (family Geometridae),   (family Pyralidae),   (family Nymphalidae), and   (family Hesperiidae) being dominant elements of the   fauna everywhere. A few families are characteristically more abundant in one   than in others. Central and   are characterized by great diversity of American false tiger moths (family Notodonidae) and ctenuchid moths (family Arctiidae). The North American (Nearctic) and Eurasian (Palaearctic) families show much evidence of close connections, chiefly between Asia and western  . Each region has, however, many distinctive genera. Many lepidopterans exist only in isolated colonies as  relict (remnant) populations, cut off from relatives elsewhere by geologic or climatic changes.   and   have unusually   relict populations of the primitive   (family Micropterigidae) and  , or ghost moths (family Hepialidae). In North America, Europe, and Asia, many relict species have survived since the last   on isolated southern mountaintops. Many hundreds of Lepidoptera injure plants useful to humans, including some of the most important sources of food, fabrics, fodder, and timber. The great majority of the   are moths, and the   life stage is always the larva. However, unlike members of other insect orders, lepidopterans do not act as carriers of  , nor are any of them parasites of or injurious to humans. However, some species feed on open   or bodily secretions of wild or domestic animals.  The list of valuable plants subject to damage by lepidopterans is a long one, including many grains,   and  ,  ,  , some root crops and   crops, many fruits, and timber and shade  . The damage may involve the leaves, stems, roots, or fruit. Woolens, furs, silk, and even feathers are eaten by fungus moths (   ) of several genera (clothes moths).

A protein   is very large compared with molecules of sugar or salt and consists of many   joined together to form long chains, much as beads are arranged on a string. There are about 20 different amino acids that occur naturally in proteins. Proteins of similar function have similar amino acid   and sequence. Although it is not yet possible to explain all of the functions of a protein from its amino acid sequence, established correlations between structure and function can be attributed to the properties of the amino acids that compose proteins.  can synthesize all of the amino acids;   cannot, even though all of them are essential for life. Plants can grow in a medium containing inorganic nutrients that provide  ,  , and other substances essential for growth. They utilize the   in the air during the process of   to form organic   such as  . Animals, however, must obtain organic nutrients from outside sources. Because the protein content of most plants is low, very large amounts of plant material are required by animals, such as   (e.g., cows), that eat only plant material to meet their amino acid requirements. Nonruminant animals, including humans, obtain proteins principally from animals and their products—e.g., meat, milk, and eggs. The seeds of legumes are increasingly being used to prepare inexpensive protein-rich   (   ). The protein content of animal organs is usually much higher than that of the blood  . Muscles, for example, contain about 30 percent protein, the liver 20 to 30 percent, and   30 percent. Higher percentages of protein are found in hair, bones, and other organs and tissues with a low   content. The quantity of free amino acids and   in animals is much smaller than the amount of protein; protein molecules are produced in   by the stepwise alignment of amino acids and are released into the body fluids only after   is complete. The high protein content of some organs does not mean that the importance of proteins is related to their amount in an organism or  ; on the contrary, some of the most important proteins, such as   and  , occur in extremely small amounts. The importance of proteins is related principally to their function. All enzymes identified thus far are proteins. Enzymes, which are the   of all metabolic reactions, enable an organism to build up the chemical substances necessary for life—proteins,  , carbohydrates, and  —to convert them into other substances, and to degrade them. Life without enzymes is not possible. There are several protein hormones with important regulatory functions. In all vertebrates, the respiratory protein   acts as   carrier in the  , transporting oxygen from the   to body organs and tissues.

Content: The insects are the largest group of  . In fact, about 75 percent of all animals are insects. Insects developed on Earth long before humans did. Today there are about 1 million known species, or types, of insect. And scientists are constantly discovering new species. Butterflies, beetles, ants, flies, grasshoppers, silverfish, and bees are all insects. Insects live all over the world. They can survive in almost any place where food is available. For instance, insects can be found in cold regions, hot rain forests, deserts, mountains, caves, and freshwater. A few kinds even live in salt water. Insects are members of a larger group called the arthropods. This group also includes spiders, ticks, centipedes, lobsters, and crabs. Like all arthropods, insects have a body that is divided into segments, or sections. They also lack a skeleton inside the body. Instead, insects and other arthropods have a covering on the outside of the body called an exoskeleton. This exoskeleton protects the body. Unlike other arthropods, insects have three major body segments. Insects also have six legs. This is one way that insects differ from spiders, which have eight legs. Insects also have at least one pair of antennas, or feelers. The three major segments of an insect body are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The head contains the insect’s antennas, mouthparts, and eyes. The adults of many species have two kinds of eyes, simple and compound. Compound eyes have many lenslike parts. Each of these receives a separate image. The images are combined into a single picture in the insect’s brain. The thorax has three pairs of legs and usually two pairs of wings. But some insects have only one pair of wings or no wings at all. The abdomen is made up of as many as 11 segments. It contains organs that digest food, push out wastes, and help the insect reproduce. Insects vary greatly in size. Most insects are small, usually less than 0.2 inch (6 millimeters) long. However, some insects called walkingsticks can grow to more than 12 inches (30 centimeters) long. Insects have a variety of ways to protect themselves from their enemies. For example, some insects hide by blending in to their surroundings. Many moths have a similar   to the bark of the trees on which they rest. Beetles have a very hard body armor to protect them. Some insects bite or sting their enemies. Some kinds produce poison. Some kinds of insects live alone, while others live in groups. Termites, ants, and some bees and wasps live in very organized groups. Each individual has a particular job to do for the group. For example, some termites are born to be soldiers or workers. Other termites will be the king and queen. Insects eat a great variety of plants, animals, and other living things. Certain insects, such as fleas and lice, live on the body of another animal. They get all their food from that animal’s body. Such insects are called  . Most insects hatch from eggs. A few kinds are born live. An insect’s exoskeleton cannot grow. Instead, as the insect grows, this covering splits apart and falls off from time to time. The insect grows a new covering. This process is called molting. There are two basic life cycles found in insects. Some insects are born in nearly the same form they will have as an adult. The insect grows and molts, eventually becoming an adult. Grasshoppers and cockroaches go through this kind of growth process. Other types undergo a complete change, or  . After they hatch, they begin life in a form called a larva. It is completely unlike the adult form. For instance, a larva may look more like a worm than an insect. The larva eats a great deal and molts several times. It then enters a resting stage in a form called a pupa. The pupa’s body changes greatly during this stage. It develops all of the features of the adult, including wings and legs. When this stage is complete, the adult emerges from the pupa. Bees, butterflies, and moths are some insects that develop this way. Many insects are helpful to humans and other animals. Some kinds eat other insects that are pests. Insects are also food for other animals. Some insects produce valuable products such as honey, silk, and dyes. Many flowering plants depend on insects such as bees to help them reproduce. As insects feed on flowers, they spread a substance called   from the male parts of flowers to the female parts. This allows the female parts to make seeds. Insects can also be pests. Some insects sting or bite people or other animals. Many insects can spread diseases to people, other animals, and plants. And some harmful insects eat crops, wood, clothing, and carpet.

Food serves multiple functions in most living organisms. For example, it provides materials that are metabolized to supply the   required for the absorption and translocation of  , for the synthesis of   materials, for movement and  , for   of waste products, and for all other activities of the organism. Food also provides materials from which all the structural and   components of the living cell can be assembled. Living organisms differ in the particular substances that they require as food, in the manner in which they synthesize food substances or obtain them from the surrounding  , and in the functions that these substances carry out in their cells. Nevertheless, general patterns can be discerned in the nutritional process throughout the living world and in the types of nutrients that are required to sustain  . These patterns are the subject of this article. For a full discussion of the nutritional requirements of humans in particular,   the article  . Living organisms can be categorized by the way in which the functions of food are carried out in their bodies. Thus, organisms such as green   and some   that need only   for   can be called   organisms; and organisms, including all  ,  , and most bacteria, that require both inorganic and   for growth are called  . Other classifications have been used to include various other nutritional patterns. In one scheme, organisms are classified according to the energy source they utilize. Phototrophic, or  , organisms trap   energy and convert it to  , whereas  , or chemosynthetic, organisms utilize inorganic or organic   to supply their energy requirements. If the  -donor materials utilized to form reduced   consist of inorganic compounds, the organism is said to be  ; if organic, the organism is  organotrophic. Combinations of these patterns may also be used to describe organisms. Higher plants, for example, are  photolithotrophic; i.e., they utilize light energy, with the inorganic     serving as the ultimate electron donor. Certain photosynthetic bacteria that cannot utilize water as the electron donor and require organic compounds for this purpose are called  photoorganotrophs. Animals, according to this classification, are  chemoorganotrophs; i.e., they utilize   to supply energy and organic compounds as electron donors. Despite wide variations in the nature of the external energy source utilized by various organisms, all organisms form from their external energy source an immediate source of energy, the chemical compound   (ATP). This energy-rich compound is common to all cells. Through the breaking of its high-energy   bonds and thus by its   to a less energy-rich compound, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), ATP provides the energy for the chemical and mechanical work required by an organism. The energy requirements of organisms can be measured in either   or  .

It occurs commonly among lower   and     (particularly  ,  ,  ,  , and  ) and rarely among higher  . An   produced parthenogenetically may be either haploid (i.e., with one set of dissimilar  ) or diploid (i.e., with a paired set of chromosomes). Parthenogenic species may be   (that is, incapable of  ) or facultative (that is, capable of switching between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction depending upon environmental conditions). The term   is taken from the Greek words  , meaning “virgin,” and  , meaning “origin.” More than 2,000 species are thought to reproduce parthenogenically. Parthenogenesis is sometimes considered to be an asexual form of reproduction; however, it may be more accurately described as an “incomplete form of sexual reproduction,” since offspring of parthenogenic species develop from gametes. Gametes are reproductive cells that result from meiosis (or reduction division)—in which a specialized cell with a (diploid) double set of chromosomes undergoes two fissions of its  . Meiosis gives rise to four gametes, or sex cells, which are haploid—in that each possesses half the number of chromosomes of the original cell (   ). Parthenogenesis can operate on either a haploid or a diploid cell. In haploid parthenogenesis, a rare form of parthenogenesis that occurs in a few species of bees, nematodes, and plants,   develop from haploid eggs to produce haploid adults. On the other hand, the process of diploid parthenogenesis, a more common and varied form of the phenomenon, may proceed along two pathways. Automixis (automictic parthenogenesis) is a postmeiotic process in which a haploid cell may either duplicate its chromosomes or join with another haploid cell. In both cases, diploid zygotes develop and grow into diploid adults. Such organisms are not true clones of the mother, however, because the meiotic process separates and recombines the genetic material. A second form of diploid parthenogenesis,   (apomicitic parthenogenesis), forgoes complete meiosis altogether. Instead, two genetically identical diploid egg cells are produced from a parent cell through   (the process of cell duplication), and one or more of these daughter cells, which are both diploid and   (that is, genetically identical) of the original parent cell, develop into a diploid offspring. Diploid parthenogenesis occurs in insects such as aphids as well as in some rotifers and flowering plants (    and  ). In the insect order   (which includes bees, wasps, and ants), parthenogenesis can take one of three forms: arrhenotoky, thelytoky, and deuterotoky. In arrhenotoky, haploid males are produced from unfertilized eggs laid by mated (impregnated) females or by so-called secondary, or supplementary, queens, which have not been impregnated. In thelytoky, which occurs in many species of the suborder Symphyta (a group that includes the  , the  , and the  ), unmated females produce males. In deuterotoky, unmated females of some Symphyta produce females as well as males. The occurrence of these forms is not always mutually  . For example, in   (bees), about 1 percent of the eggs laid by secondary queens may be female. Sometimes associated with arrhenotoky, thelytoky, and deuterotoky is pseudoarrhenotoky (or paternal genome elimination). Pseudoarrhenotoky is a nonparthenogenic form of   that occurs in the hymenopteran superfamily Chalcidoidea (a group of small parasitic wasps) and in some mites, Like arrhenotoky, pseudoarrhenotoky results in the production of haploid males. In this process, development begins as diploid organisms within fertilized eggs; however, as development progresses, males become haploid after the paternal contribution to the genome has been lost, eliminated, or deactivated. A number of parthenogenic variations have been observed. Some aphids and    undergo a type of parthenogenesis called heterogony or cyclic parthenogenesis. In these species, generations of offspring produced from fertilized eggs may alternate with those produced from unfertilized ones. Such an   in both groups of insects is thought to result partly from seasonal temperature changes, with eggs produced through sexual reproduction having a greater ability to withstand the winter cold. They lie dormant until temperatures rise. Pseudogamy (gynogenesis, or sperm-dependent parthenogenesis) is another variation, which appears in the life cycle of a few insects, mites, and salamanders as well as the flatworm  .   is hermaphroditic and may be diploid (which can reproduce sexually) or   (that is, with one or more additional sets of chromosomes). Whereas sexual reproduction requires   for fertilization, parthenogenic reproduction in this species involves sperm only to   the initial development of the egg; the sperm’s genetic material is not used.

In zoology, the Latin term for egg,  , is frequently used to refer to the single cell, while the word   may be applied to the entire specialized structure or capsule that consists of the ovum, its various protective membranes, and any accompanying nutritive materials. The human female reproductive cell is also usually called an ovum. The egg, like the male gamete, bears only a single (haploid) set of chromosomes. The egg, however, is usually larger than its male counterpart because it contains material to nourish the   during its early stages of  . In many   species a large quantity of nutritive material, or  , is deposited in the egg, the amount depending on the length of time before the young animal can feed itself or, in the case of mammals, begins to receive nourishment from the maternal  . The plant egg is never so disproportionately large, because the developing sporophyte embryo is nourished until self-supporting by the plant on which it is formed (in liverworts, mosses, and ferns by the gametophyte; in   plants by the sporophyte on which the   is parasitic). With the exception of those of some cnidarians (coelenterates), all animal eggs are enclosed by membranes, the innermost of which is called the  . The vitelline membrane is the only membrane in the eggs of various invertebrates—ctenophores, many worms, and echinoderms—and of certain lower chordates. All higher vertebrates and many invertebrates have one or more additional membranes. Insect eggs, for example, are covered by a thick, hard  , and the   egg is surrounded by a jelly layer. The   egg includes the vitelline membrane, the white of the egg, two egg shell membranes, and the outermost membrane, the shell. As pointed out above, this entire structure is commonly referred to as an egg. Mature eggs remain functional for a relatively short period of time, after which fertilization cannot occur. The eggs of most invertebrates,  , and   must be fertilized a few minutes after they are shed into the water; an exception is   eggs, which are viable for about 40 hours after their release. Most other animal eggs have life spans similar to that of the human egg—i.e., 12 to 24 hours.    .

Cicadas are found in tropical and temperate areas worldwide and occur in  ,  , and  . Cicadas have long been used in folk medicines, as religious and   symbols, and as an important source of food for humans and many other organisms. The cicada appears in the mythology, literature, and music of many  , including those of some   peoples in the Americas, and the males of certain Asian species have even been kept in cages for their melodious songs.   . Cicadas are medium to large insects, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm (0.8 to 2 inches). They characteristically have short antennae, two pairs of transparent membranous wings, prominent   eyes, and three simple eyes (ocelli) that form a triangle between the compound eyes. The insects do not bite or sting. Major species are generally easily recognized by differences in songs, behavior, and  . The shrill thorntree cicada ( ), found in Africa, is thought to be the loudest insect in the world. Exceeding 106 decibels, the males’ songs are nearly as loud as a chainsaw (110 decibels). Male cicadas produce loud noises by vibrating membranes ( ) near the base of the  . Males of each species typically have three distinct  : a congregational song that is regulated by daily weather fluctuations and by songs produced by other males; a courtship song, usually produced prior to copulation; and a disturbance squawk, produced by individuals captured, held, or disturbed into flight. Most North American cicadas produce rhythmical ticks, buzzes,  , or screams, although in some species the song is musical. Females lack tymbals, though some species use their wings to produce clicking or snapping sounds, often in response to the songs of the males. All cicada species have a life cycle that consists of three stages: egg,  , and adult. Adult female cicadas usually lay their eggs in woody plant tissues. Newly hatched   burrow into the ground where they suck juices from roots of   plants. Nymphs usually undergo five molts during the year or more required to reach maturity. When prompted to emerge—the biology of which is not well understood for long-lived species—mature nymphs often appear aboveground en masse and undergo their final molt on nearby trees. The winged adults live for only a few weeks, just long enough to find a mate and lay eggs. Although not ordinarily considered a pest, the females, if numerous, may damage young saplings during their egg laying. A large and   group, the cicada family   more than 500 genera worldwide. The   ( ) are among the most fascinating and best-known cicadas. The genus contains seven North American species of    (often erroneously called 17-year locusts) and . In what are among the longest life cycles of any insects, periodical cicadas emerge in spring only every 13 or 17 years, with millions of insects materializing from the soil in a matter of weeks and dying shortly thereafter. These species occur in chronologically and geographically isolated broods. To distinguish them from the periodical cicadas, a number of North American species are known as annual cicadas. These are seen every summer, though their   typically span 2–5 years. Annual cicadas include the  dog-day cicadas (genus  ), scrub cicadas (genus  ), several species of the genus  , and members of the genus  . The nearly 60 species of the genus   are found in Europe, the  , and parts of Africa. The common, or  , cicada ( ) is one of the most familiar species in Europe.

By the end of the 20th century the   had spread to the western   region. Damage is less severe in its original European range, where the moth has several natural enemies. The heavy-bodied flightless female moth is white with black zigzag markings and has a wingspan of 38 to 50 mm (1.5 to 2 inches). The smaller, darker male is a strong flier. Eggs deposited in   during July are covered with a mass of buff-coloured hair from the female’s abdomen. They hatch the following spring. The flat, pale brown  , with tufts of stiff brown and yellow hairs on their sides, grow to 50 mm and are voracious feeders. They often completely strip trees of their   in several weeks. Unlike most   and  , the larvae are the main dispersal stage. Small larvae spin silk from glands in their mouthparts and hang from branches high up in trees. If the silk lines are long enough, the wind breaks them from the tree, and the silk acts as a  , carrying the young larvae to new, uninfested trees to feed. When larval development is complete, they crawl down the tree trunk, settle in leaf   at the base of the tree, and enter the pupal stage. The adult moth emerges from the   after about 10 days, completing the annual generation. A larger strain, the  Asian spongy moth, has a wingspan of about 90 mm. It poses an even greater threat than its European relative because the female can fly, enabling it to spread quickly, and the larvae, which range in colour from light to dark brown, will eat the leaves of coniferous as well as deciduous trees. It has defoliated millions of hectares of trees in Russia and China and was discovered in northwestern North America in 1991. Spraying of young larvae with either traditional or biological   remains the most effective means of controlling spongy moths.

This order of insects is second in size only to  , the beetles. Because of their day-flying habits and bright colours, the butterflies are more familiar than the chiefly night-flying and dull-coloured moths, but the latter are far more varied and  . The skippers are a worldwide group intermediate between butterflies and moths. With the exception of a few moths, all adult lepidopterans have two pairs of wings. The name Lepidoptera is derived from the Greek, meaning “scaly winged,” and refers to the characteristic covering of microscopic dustlike   on the wings. The life cycle of lepidopterans consists of four stages:  ,   ( ),   (chrysalis), and adult (imago). The larvae do most of the eating, with the majority feeding on foliage, although many species eat  ,  ,  , or  . A number of moth and a few   larvae are serious   in agriculture and forestry. The adults of many species are important for their role in  , which occurs as they visit flowers for  . In most land   the lepidopterans are ecologically important because they transform large amounts of   matter into   matter and in turn serve as food for many other groups of animals. Many members of the order, especially the butterflies, have appealed to the human imagination for thousands of years as   of fragile and   beauty. References to them abound in literature, and they have been depicted in many paintings, have inspired the designs of  , ornaments, and  , and have even occurred in many heraldic devices and on postage stamps. Moths, butterflies, and skippers show great   in size and development rates. Some moths have wingspans as small as 4 mm (0.13 inch), whereas the largest moths and butterflies measure nearly 30 cm (about 1 foot). Fast-developing species may complete their development in as little as three weeks, while slower ones may require as long as two or even three years. Lepidopterans live on every continent except  . Though they are far more numerous and diversified in the tropics, some species survive at the limits of polar vegetation. There are many successful species in nearly every  , from arid   and high mountaintops to   and tropical  . Most have become adapted for life in relatively restricted ecological   and may be limited to only one or a small group of food plants, often to only a single part of one plant. They are therefore seldom abundant in more than one type of  . However, a few species have broader food habits and may occasionally reach peaks of abnormal abundance and defoliate large areas of deciduous   or  . Some of the insects most injurious to human interests in agriculture and forestry are members of the Lepidoptera. The large family-level groups and many smaller ones are   in distribution, with   (family Noctuidae),   (family Geometridae),   (family Pyralidae),   (family Nymphalidae), and   (family Hesperiidae) being dominant elements of the   fauna everywhere. A few families are characteristically more abundant in one   than in others. Central and   are characterized by great diversity of American false tiger moths (family Notodonidae) and ctenuchid moths (family Arctiidae). The North American (Nearctic) and Eurasian (Palaearctic) families show much evidence of close connections, chiefly between Asia and western  . Each region has, however, many distinctive genera. Many lepidopterans exist only in isolated colonies as  relict (remnant) populations, cut off from relatives elsewhere by geologic or climatic changes.   and   have unusually   relict populations of the primitive   (family Micropterigidae) and  , or ghost moths (family Hepialidae). In North America, Europe, and Asia, many relict species have survived since the last   on isolated southern mountaintops. Many hundreds of Lepidoptera injure plants useful to humans, including some of the most important sources of food, fabrics, fodder, and timber. The great majority of the   are moths, and the   life stage is always the larva. However, unlike members of other insect orders, lepidopterans do not act as carriers of  , nor are any of them parasites of or injurious to humans. However, some species feed on open   or bodily secretions of wild or domestic animals.  The list of valuable plants subject to damage by lepidopterans is a long one, including many grains,   and  ,  ,  , some root crops and   crops, many fruits, and timber and shade  . The damage may involve the leaves, stems, roots, or fruit. Woolens, furs, silk, and even feathers are eaten by fungus moths (   ) of several genera (clothes moths). The   ( ) causes considerable damage in  . A few Lepidoptera are directly   to humans. Nearly all   is obtained from the   ( ), which is originally from China.

The larvae of one   ( , or  ) are collected in large quantities in the Congo, and the 10-cm (4-inch) caterpillars of giant skippers (family Megathymidae), known in   as  , are both consumed domestically and canned and exported for   as  . The South American   ( ) has been highly beneficial in   control, clearing more than 150 million ha (60 million acres) in Australia of alien   cactus. Doubtless, humans also benefit from much unrecognized weed eating by caterpillars and flower pollination by adults.

Echolocation is used for orientation, obstacle avoidance, food procurement, and social interactions. Echolocation is known to be employed by most bats (all members of the suborder Microchiroptera and one  ,   of the Megachiroptera); most, if not all,   and porpoises (Odontoceti), but apparently no baleen whales; a few shrews; and two kinds of birds, the   ( ) of northern   and certain cave   ( ) of  . Echolocation pulses consist of short bursts of sound at frequencies ranging from about 1,000 hertz in birds to at least 200,000 hertz in whales. Bats utilize frequencies from as low as 11,000 hertz (e.g., the  European free-tailed bat [ ]) to as high as 212,000 hertz (e.g.,  Percival’s trident bat [ ]). The pulses are repeated at varying rates (often in a single individual, depending upon the situation), beginning at about one per second. The rate may reach several hundred per second (e.g., in a bat close to its target). In microchiropteran bats and some toothed whales, a mutated form of a protein called  prestin increases their sensitivity to high-frequency sounds and thereby   the detection of return echoes. The nearly identical molecular structure of the   gene in these animals, which differs from the structure of the   gene found in all other mammals, is an example of convergent evolution, in which the two groups independently evolved the same form of the echolocating protein in response to similar environmental pressures.

A protein   is very large compared with molecules of sugar or salt and consists of many   joined together to form long chains, much as beads are arranged on a string. There are about 20 different amino acids that occur naturally in proteins. Proteins of similar function have similar amino acid   and sequence. Although it is not yet possible to explain all of the functions of a protein from its amino acid sequence, established correlations between structure and function can be attributed to the properties of the amino acids that compose proteins.  can synthesize all of the amino acids;   cannot, even though all of them are essential for life. Plants can grow in a medium containing inorganic nutrients that provide  ,  , and other substances essential for growth. They utilize the   in the air during the process of   to form organic   such as  . Animals, however, must obtain organic nutrients from outside sources. Because the protein content of most plants is low, very large amounts of plant material are required by animals, such as   (e.g., cows), that eat only plant material to meet their amino acid requirements. Nonruminant animals, including humans, obtain proteins principally from animals and their products—e.g., meat, milk, and eggs. The seeds of legumes are increasingly being used to prepare inexpensive protein-rich   (   ). The protein content of animal organs is usually much higher than that of the blood  . Muscles, for example, contain about 30 percent protein, the liver 20 to 30 percent, and   30 percent. Higher percentages of protein are found in hair, bones, and other organs and tissues with a low   content. The quantity of free amino acids and   in animals is much smaller than the amount of protein; protein molecules are produced in   by the stepwise alignment of amino acids and are released into the body fluids only after   is complete. The high protein content of some organs does not mean that the importance of proteins is related to their amount in an organism or  ; on the contrary, some of the most important proteins, such as   and  , occur in extremely small amounts. The importance of proteins is related principally to their function. All enzymes identified thus far are proteins. Enzymes, which are the   of all metabolic reactions, enable an organism to build up the chemical substances necessary for life—proteins,  , carbohydrates, and  —to convert them into other substances, and to degrade them. Life without enzymes is not possible. There are several protein hormones with important regulatory functions. In all vertebrates, the respiratory protein   acts as   carrier in the  , transporting oxygen from the   to body organs and tissues. A large group of structural proteins maintains and protects the structure of the animal body.

Food serves multiple functions in most living organisms. For example, it provides materials that are metabolized to supply the   required for the absorption and translocation of  , for the synthesis of   materials, for movement and  , for   of waste products, and for all other activities of the organism. Food also provides materials from which all the structural and   components of the living cell can be assembled. Living organisms differ in the particular substances that they require as food, in the manner in which they synthesize food substances or obtain them from the surrounding  , and in the functions that these substances carry out in their cells.

If the  -donor materials utilized to form reduced   consist of inorganic compounds, the organism is said to be  ; if organic, the organism is  organotrophic. Combinations of these patterns may also be used to describe organisms. Higher plants, for example, are  photolithotrophic; i.e., they utilize light energy, with the inorganic     serving as the ultimate electron donor. Certain photosynthetic bacteria that cannot utilize water as the electron donor and require organic compounds for this purpose are called  photoorganotrophs. Animals, according to this classification, are  chemoorganotrophs; i.e., they utilize   to supply energy and organic compounds as electron donors. Despite wide variations in the nature of the external energy source utilized by various organisms, all organisms form from their external energy source an immediate source of energy, the chemical compound   (ATP). This energy-rich compound is common to all cells. Through the breaking of its high-energy   bonds and thus by its   to a less energy-rich compound, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), ATP provides the energy for the chemical and mechanical work required by an organism.

Mosquitoes are known to   serious diseases, including  ,  ,  ,  , and  .   . The slender elongated body of the adult is covered with scales, as are the veins of the wings. Mosquitoes are also characterized by long fragile-looking legs and elongated piercing mouthparts. The feathery antennae of the male are generally bushier than those of the female. The males, and sometimes the females, feed on   and other   juices and are known pollinators. In most species, however, the females require the   obtained from a   meal in order to mature their eggs. Different species of mosquitoes show preferences and, in many cases, narrow restrictions as to host animals. ( ) The eggs are laid on the surface of water and   into aquatic  , or wrigglers, which swim with a jerking, wriggling movement. In most species, larvae feed on   and organic debris, although a few are predatory and may even feed on other mosquitoes. Unlike most  , mosquitoes in the pupal stage, called tumblers, are active and free-swimming. The   breathe by means of tubes on the thorax. The adults mate soon after emerging from their pupal cases. The duration of the life cycle varies greatly, depending on the species. Mosquitoes are apparently attracted to host animals by moisture,  ,  , body heat, and movement. The mosquito’s hum results from the high frequency of its wingbeats, and the female’s wingbeat frequency may serve as a means of sex recognition. There are three important mosquito   that cause   in humans. , the only known carrier of  , also transmits   and  .   mosquitoes are easily recognized from their resting position, in which the proboscis,  , and body are held in a straight line with one another but at an angle to the surface. The spotted coloring on the wings results from colored scales. Egg laying usually occurs in water containing heavy vegetation. The female deposits her eggs singly on the water surface.   larvae lie parallel to the water surface and breathe through posterior spiracular plates on the   instead of through a tube, as do most other mosquito larvae. The   is from 18 days to several weeks. The     is a carrier of viral encephalitis and, in tropical and subtropical climates, of filariasis. It holds its body parallel to the resting surface and its proboscis is bent downward relative to the surface. The wings, with scales on the veins and the margin, are uniform in color. The tip of the female’s abdomen is blunt and has retracted cerci (sensory appendages). Egg laying may occur on almost any body of fresh water, including standing polluted water. The eggs, which float on the water, are joined in masses of 100 or more. The long and slender   larvae have breathing tubes that contain hair tufts. They hang head downward at an angle of 45° from the water surface. The life cycle, usually 10 to 14 days, may be longer in cold weather. The northern house mosquito ( ) is the most   species in northern regions, while the southern house mosquito ( ) is abundant in southern regions, namely the tropics and subtropics. The genus   carries the pathogens that cause  ,  ,  , and encephalitis. Like  , it holds its body parallel to the resting surface, with the proboscis bent down. The wings are uniformly colored.   may be distinguished from   by its silver thorax with white markings and posterior spiracular bristles. The tip of the female’s abdomen is pointed and has protruding cerci.   usually lays eggs in floodwater, rain pools, or  . The eggs are capable of withstanding long periods of dryness. The short,   larvae have a breathing tube containing a pair of tufts, and the larvae hang head down at a 45° angle from the water surface. The life cycle may be as short as 10 days or, in cool weather, as long as several months. , the important carrier of the   responsible for yellow fever, has white bands on its legs and spots on its abdomen and thorax. This domestic species breeds in almost any kind of container, from   pots to discarded car-tire casings. The eastern salt marsh mosquito ( ), the black salt marsh mosquito ( ), and the summer salt marsh mosquito ( ) are important mosquitoes in coastal marsh areas that experience daily or occasional flooding with brackish or  . They are   breeders, strong fliers, and irritants to animals, including humans. Because mosquitoes are such prolific carriers of infectious diseases, preventing them from feeding on humans is considered to be a key global health strategy. The likelihood of disease transmission can be reduced through the use of mosquito repellent, long clothing that covers the arms and legs, screens in open doors and windows, and insecticide-treated mosquito bed nets. Mosquito populations can be controlled in part through the elimination of sources of standing water, which provide ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes. A surface film of oil can be applied to standing water to clog the breathing tubes of wrigglers, which may also be killed by larvicides.   using larvivorous  , such as the   ( ) is an option for some bodies of water. At times,   are used to destroy adult mosquitoes indoors. Aerial and truck-spraying applications of insecticides are commonly used in urban areas. Such applications are often done in the early evening to reduce the impact on pollinators, and ideally, they consist of insecticides that leave minimal residual effects, though regulations vary widely across the globe. Even in developed countries, commercial yard treatments are often less regulated than municipal applications and are frequently overused by the public. Nontarget   species and many   insects, including  , are often killed with broad or persistent insecticide treatments. Naled, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and other common insecticides used for mosquito control can make their way into waterways and harm aquatic invertebrates, affecting food webs far beyond the application site. Using mosquito insecticides in adverse weather conditions can   their negative environmental impacts. Researchers have investigated the possibility of manipulating mosquito populations to prevent the production of viable mosquito offspring, thereby reducing the number of mosquitoes. Researchers have also identified ways in which male mosquitoes may be   to transmit a gene to their offspring that causes the offspring to die before becoming sexually mature. Scientists have found that female mosquitoes are less attracted to humans when exposed to small   related to the   molecule neuropeptide Y. These compounds could be emitted via dispensers in areas where mosquitoes are abundant, helping to deter them from biting humans.

Cicadas are found in tropical and temperate areas worldwide and occur in  ,  , and  . Cicadas have long been used in folk medicines, as religious and   symbols, and as an important source of food for humans and many other organisms. The cicada appears in the mythology, literature, and music of many  , including those of some   peoples in the Americas, and the males of certain Asian species have even been kept in cages for their melodious songs.   . Cicadas are medium to large insects, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm (0.8 to 2 inches). They characteristically have short antennae, two pairs of transparent membranous wings, prominent   eyes, and three simple eyes (ocelli) that form a triangle between the compound eyes. The insects do not bite or sting. Major species are generally easily recognized by differences in songs, behavior, and  . The shrill thorntree cicada ( ), found in Africa, is thought to be the loudest insect in the world. Exceeding 106 decibels, the males’ songs are nearly as loud as a chainsaw (110 decibels). Male cicadas produce loud noises by vibrating membranes ( ) near the base of the  . Males of each species typically have three distinct  : a congregational song that is regulated by daily weather fluctuations and by songs produced by other males; a courtship song, usually produced prior to copulation; and a disturbance squawk, produced by individuals captured, held, or disturbed into flight. Most North American cicadas produce rhythmical ticks, buzzes,  , or screams, although in some species the song is musical. Females lack tymbals, though some species use their wings to produce clicking or snapping sounds, often in response to the songs of the males. All cicada species have a life cycle that consists of three stages: egg,  , and adult. Adult female cicadas usually lay their eggs in woody plant tissues. Newly hatched   burrow into the ground where they suck juices from roots of   plants. Nymphs usually undergo five molts during the year or more required to reach maturity. When prompted to emerge—the biology of which is not well understood for long-lived species—mature nymphs often appear aboveground en masse and undergo their final molt on nearby trees. The winged adults live for only a few weeks, just long enough to find a mate and lay eggs. Although not ordinarily considered a pest, the females, if numerous, may damage young saplings during their egg laying. A large and   group, the cicada family   more than 500 genera worldwide. The   ( ) are among the most fascinating and best-known cicadas. The genus contains seven North American species of    (often erroneously called 17-year locusts) and . In what are among the longest life cycles of any insects, periodical cicadas emerge in spring only every 13 or 17 years, with millions of insects materializing from the soil in a matter of weeks and dying shortly thereafter. These species occur in chronologically and geographically isolated broods. To distinguish them from the periodical cicadas, a number of North American species are known as annual cicadas. These are seen every summer, though their   typically span 2–5 years. Annual cicadas include the  dog-day cicadas (genus  ), scrub cicadas (genus  ), several species of the genus  , and members of the genus  . The nearly 60 species of the genus   are found in Europe, the  , and parts of Africa. The common, or  , cicada ( ) is one of the most familiar species in Europe. The   cicada ( ) is the only cicada native to the United Kingdom, where it is considered an  . The largest cicadas in the world are found in Asia. Members of the genus   are large-bodied insects native to  . Included is the empress cicada ( ), the most massive of all known cicada species, with a superlative body length of about 7 cm (2.8 inches).

In zoology, the Latin term for egg,  , is frequently used to refer to the single cell, while the word   may be applied to the entire specialized structure or capsule that consists of the ovum, its various protective membranes, and any accompanying nutritive materials. The human female reproductive cell is also usually called an ovum. The egg, like the male gamete, bears only a single (haploid) set of chromosomes. The egg, however, is usually larger than its male counterpart because it contains material to nourish the   during its early stages of  . In many   species a large quantity of nutritive material, or  , is deposited in the egg, the amount depending on the length of time before the young animal can feed itself or, in the case of mammals, begins to receive nourishment from the maternal  . The plant egg is never so disproportionately large, because the developing sporophyte embryo is nourished until self-supporting by the plant on which it is formed (in liverworts, mosses, and ferns by the gametophyte; in   plants by the sporophyte on which the   is parasitic). With the exception of those of some cnidarians (coelenterates), all animal eggs are enclosed by membranes, the innermost of which is called the  . The vitelline membrane is the only membrane in the eggs of various invertebrates—ctenophores, many worms, and echinoderms—and of certain lower chordates. All higher vertebrates and many invertebrates have one or more additional membranes. Insect eggs, for example, are covered by a thick, hard  , and the   egg is surrounded by a jelly layer. The   egg includes the vitelline membrane, the white of the egg, two egg shell membranes, and the outermost membrane, the shell. As pointed out above, this entire structure is commonly referred to as an egg. Mature eggs remain functional for a relatively short period of time, after which fertilization cannot occur. The eggs of most invertebrates,  , and   must be fertilized a few minutes after they are shed into the water; an exception is   eggs, which are viable for about 40 hours after their release. Most other animal eggs have life spans similar to that of the human egg—i.e., 12 to 24 hours.    .

Fats are usually solid at ordinary temperatures, such as 25 °C (77 °F), but they begin to liquefy at somewhat higher temperatures. Chemically, fats are identical to animal and   oils, consisting primarily of  , which are esters formed by the reaction of three molecules of fatty acids with one molecule of   (   ). Together with oils, fats   one of the three principal classes of foodstuffs, the others being proteins and carbohydrates. Nearly all cells contain these basic substances. Fat is sometimes called nature’s storehouse of   because on a weight basis it contains more than twice as much energy as does   or  . It is probably as storehouses or depots of concentrated energy that fats appear in   reproductive organs, such as pollen grains and seeds. It is this fat that humans recover from plants for use as   or in industry. The fat content of the nonreproductive tissue of plants is usually so low that recovery is impracticable.   much dietary fat comes from natural foodstuffs without being separated from the other plant materials with which it occurs. The proportion of fat in these foodstuffs varies from 0.1 percent in white potatoes to 70 percent in some nut kernels. More than 90 percent of the fat recovered in the world is obtained from about 20 species of plants and animals. Most of this separated fat is used eventually as human food. Consequently, fat technology deals largely with the separation and processing of fats into forms acceptable to the various dietary customs in the countries in which they are to be used. (For further information on the subject,    .) Humans have used many natural fats for both food and nonfood purposes since prehistoric times. The Egyptians, for example, used   as a lubricant in moving heavy building materials. They also made axle greases from fat and lime, mixed with other materials, as early as 1400  . Homer mentions oil as an aid to  , and Pliny talks about hard and soft soaps. Candles and lamps using oil or   have been used for thousands of years. The commercial uses of fats have increased in number as the understanding of the chemical nature of fats has expanded.  , a Swedish chemist, discovered in 1779 that glycerol could be obtained from olive oil by heating it with litharge (lead monoxide), but it was not until about 1815 that the French chemist   (1786–1889) demonstrated the chemical nature of fats and oils. A few years later the separation of liquid acids from solid acids was accomplished.   was invented by the French chemist  , who in 1869 won a prize offered by   for a satisfactory   substitute. The modern   process had its origin in research in the late 19th century that led to the establishment of the vegetable-oil-shortening industry and a variety of industrial applications. After  , organic chemists gained extensive knowledge first of     and then of glyceride compositions. Growth of the   stimulated a simultaneous expansion of the use of fats as raw materials and as intermediates for scores of new chemicals. The modern application of many organic chemical reactions to fats and fatty acids formed the foundation of a new and rapidly growing fatty-chemicals industry. The universal distribution of fats in plant and animal   suggests physiological roles that go beyond their function as a fuel supply for the cells. In animals the most evident function of fats is that of a food reserve to supply energy (through   enzymatic oxidation—that is, combination with oxygen catalyzed by  ). The storage of fat in vegetable seeds can be explained similarly on the basis that it is a food reserve for the embryo. It is not so easy, however, to account for the presence of large quantities of fat in such fruits as olives, avocados, and palms; much of this fat is probably lost or destroyed before the seed germinates. Fats fulfill other valuable functions in plants and animals. Subcutaneous deposits of fat insulate animals against cold because of the low rate of   in fat, a property especially important for animals living in cold waters or climates—e.g., whales, walruses, and bears. Fats that have been separated from tissues always contain small quantities of closely associated nonglyceride lipids such as phospholipids, sterols, vitamins A, D, and E, and various carotenoid pigments. Many of these substances are vital emulsifying agents or growth factors. Others function as agents that prevent deterioration of fats in plant tissues and seeds caused by destructive combination with oxygen. These minor   probably are present in the fats as a result of their physical solubility, and thus fats serve as carriers for these substances in animal diets. Many animals require some fat containing one or more of the essential fatty acids ( ,  , and to a limited extent  ) to prevent the physical symptoms of essential-fatty-acid deficiency   by skin lesions, scaliness, poor hair growth, and low growth rates. These essential fatty acids must be supplied in the diet since they cannot be synthesized in the body. The  , discovered by the Nobel laureate U.S. von Euler of Sweden, are hormonelike   derived from arachidonic acid. These biologically active fatty acids, which are present in very minute quantities in animal tissues, apparently are involved in contraction of smooth muscles, enzyme activity in    , function of the  , regulation of   and  , function of steroid hormones, fat mobilization in  , and a number of other vital functions.

By the end of the 20th century the   had spread to the western   region. Damage is less severe in its original European range, where the moth has several natural enemies. The heavy-bodied flightless female moth is white with black zigzag markings and has a wingspan of 38 to 50 mm (1.5 to 2 inches). The smaller, darker male is a strong flier. Eggs deposited in   during July are covered with a mass of buff-coloured hair from the female’s abdomen. They hatch the following spring. The flat, pale brown  , with tufts of stiff brown and yellow hairs on their sides, grow to 50 mm and are voracious feeders. They often completely strip trees of their   in several weeks. Unlike most   and  , the larvae are the main dispersal stage. Small larvae spin silk from glands in their mouthparts and hang from branches high up in trees. If the silk lines are long enough, the wind breaks them from the tree, and the silk acts as a  , carrying the young larvae to new, uninfested trees to feed. When larval development is complete, they crawl down the tree trunk, settle in leaf   at the base of the tree, and enter the pupal stage. The adult moth emerges from the   after about 10 days, completing the annual generation. A larger strain, the  Asian spongy moth, has a wingspan of about 90 mm. It poses an even greater threat than its European relative because the female can fly, enabling it to spread quickly, and the larvae, which range in colour from light to dark brown, will eat the leaves of coniferous as well as deciduous trees. It has defoliated millions of hectares of trees in Russia and China and was discovered in northwestern North America in 1991. Spraying of young larvae with either traditional or biological   remains the most effective means of controlling spongy moths.

Echolocation is used for orientation, obstacle avoidance, food procurement, and social interactions. Echolocation is known to be employed by most bats (all members of the suborder Microchiroptera and one  ,   of the Megachiroptera); most, if not all,   and porpoises (Odontoceti), but apparently no baleen whales; a few shrews; and two kinds of birds, the   ( ) of northern   and certain cave   ( ) of  . Echolocation pulses consist of short bursts of sound at frequencies ranging from about 1,000 hertz in birds to at least 200,000 hertz in whales. Bats utilize frequencies from as low as 11,000 hertz (e.g., the  European free-tailed bat [ ]) to as high as 212,000 hertz (e.g.,  Percival’s trident bat [ ]). The pulses are repeated at varying rates (often in a single individual, depending upon the situation), beginning at about one per second. The rate may reach several hundred per second (e.g., in a bat close to its target). In microchiropteran bats and some toothed whales, a mutated form of a protein called  prestin increases their sensitivity to high-frequency sounds and thereby   the detection of return echoes. The nearly identical molecular structure of the   gene in these animals, which differs from the structure of the   gene found in all other mammals, is an example of convergent evolution, in which the two groups independently evolved the same form of the echolocating protein in response to similar environmental pressures.

It occurs commonly among lower   and     (particularly  ,  ,  ,  , and  ) and rarely among higher  . An   produced parthenogenetically may be either haploid (i.e., with one set of dissimilar  ) or diploid (i.e., with a paired set of chromosomes). Parthenogenic species may be   (that is, incapable of  ) or facultative (that is, capable of switching between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction depending upon environmental conditions). The term   is taken from the Greek words  , meaning “virgin,” and  , meaning “origin.” More than 2,000 species are thought to reproduce parthenogenically. Parthenogenesis is sometimes considered to be an asexual form of reproduction; however, it may be more accurately described as an “incomplete form of sexual reproduction,” since offspring of parthenogenic species develop from gametes. Gametes are reproductive cells that result from meiosis (or reduction division)—in which a specialized cell with a (diploid) double set of chromosomes undergoes two fissions of its  . Meiosis gives rise to four gametes, or sex cells, which are haploid—in that each possesses half the number of chromosomes of the original cell (   ). Parthenogenesis can operate on either a haploid or a diploid cell. In haploid parthenogenesis, a rare form of parthenogenesis that occurs in a few species of bees, nematodes, and plants,   develop from haploid eggs to produce haploid adults. On the other hand, the process of diploid parthenogenesis, a more common and varied form of the phenomenon, may proceed along two pathways. Automixis (automictic parthenogenesis) is a postmeiotic process in which a haploid cell may either duplicate its chromosomes or join with another haploid cell. In both cases, diploid zygotes develop and grow into diploid adults. Such organisms are not true clones of the mother, however, because the meiotic process separates and recombines the genetic material. A second form of diploid parthenogenesis,   (apomicitic parthenogenesis), forgoes complete meiosis altogether. Instead, two genetically identical diploid egg cells are produced from a parent cell through   (the process of cell duplication), and one or more of these daughter cells, which are both diploid and   (that is, genetically identical) of the original parent cell, develop into a diploid offspring. Diploid parthenogenesis occurs in insects such as aphids as well as in some rotifers and flowering plants (    and  ). In the insect order   (which includes bees, wasps, and ants), parthenogenesis can take one of three forms: arrhenotoky, thelytoky, and deuterotoky. In arrhenotoky, haploid males are produced from unfertilized eggs laid by mated (impregnated) females or by so-called secondary, or supplementary, queens, which have not been impregnated. In thelytoky, which occurs in many species of the suborder Symphyta (a group that includes the  , the  , and the  ), unmated females produce males. In deuterotoky, unmated females of some Symphyta produce females as well as males. The occurrence of these forms is not always mutually  . For example, in   (bees), about 1 percent of the eggs laid by secondary queens may be female. Sometimes associated with arrhenotoky, thelytoky, and deuterotoky is pseudoarrhenotoky (or paternal genome elimination). Pseudoarrhenotoky is a nonparthenogenic form of   that occurs in the hymenopteran superfamily Chalcidoidea (a group of small parasitic wasps) and in some mites, Like arrhenotoky, pseudoarrhenotoky results in the production of haploid males. In this process, development begins as diploid organisms within fertilized eggs; however, as development progresses, males become haploid after the paternal contribution to the genome has been lost, eliminated, or deactivated. A number of parthenogenic variations have been observed. Some aphids and    undergo a type of parthenogenesis called heterogony or cyclic parthenogenesis. In these species, generations of offspring produced from fertilized eggs may alternate with those produced from unfertilized ones. Such an   in both groups of insects is thought to result partly from seasonal temperature changes, with eggs produced through sexual reproduction having a greater ability to withstand the winter cold. They lie dormant until temperatures rise. Pseudogamy (gynogenesis, or sperm-dependent parthenogenesis) is another variation, which appears in the life cycle of a few insects, mites, and salamanders as well as the flatworm  .   is hermaphroditic and may be diploid (which can reproduce sexually) or   (that is, with one or more additional sets of chromosomes).

Mosquitoes are known to   serious diseases, including  ,  ,  ,  , and  .   . The slender elongated body of the adult is covered with scales, as are the veins of the wings. Mosquitoes are also characterized by long fragile-looking legs and elongated piercing mouthparts. The feathery antennae of the male are generally bushier than those of the female. The males, and sometimes the females, feed on   and other   juices and are known pollinators. In most species, however, the females require the   obtained from a   meal in order to mature their eggs. Different species of mosquitoes show preferences and, in many cases, narrow restrictions as to host animals. ( ) The eggs are laid on the surface of water and   into aquatic  , or wrigglers, which swim with a jerking, wriggling movement. In most species, larvae feed on   and organic debris, although a few are predatory and may even feed on other mosquitoes. Unlike most  , mosquitoes in the pupal stage, called tumblers, are active and free-swimming. The   breathe by means of tubes on the thorax. The adults mate soon after emerging from their pupal cases. The duration of the life cycle varies greatly, depending on the species. Mosquitoes are apparently attracted to host animals by moisture,  ,  , body heat, and movement. The mosquito’s hum results from the high frequency of its wingbeats, and the female’s wingbeat frequency may serve as a means of sex recognition. There are three important mosquito   that cause   in humans. , the only known carrier of  , also transmits   and  .   mosquitoes are easily recognized from their resting position, in which the proboscis,  , and body are held in a straight line with one another but at an angle to the surface. The spotted coloring on the wings results from colored scales. Egg laying usually occurs in water containing heavy vegetation. The female deposits her eggs singly on the water surface.   larvae lie parallel to the water surface and breathe through posterior spiracular plates on the   instead of through a tube, as do most other mosquito larvae. The   is from 18 days to several weeks. The     is a carrier of viral encephalitis and, in tropical and subtropical climates, of filariasis. It holds its body parallel to the resting surface and its proboscis is bent downward relative to the surface. The wings, with scales on the veins and the margin, are uniform in color. The tip of the female’s abdomen is blunt and has retracted cerci (sensory appendages). Egg laying may occur on almost any body of fresh water, including standing polluted water. The eggs, which float on the water, are joined in masses of 100 or more. The long and slender   larvae have breathing tubes that contain hair tufts. They hang head downward at an angle of 45° from the water surface. The life cycle, usually 10 to 14 days, may be longer in cold weather. The northern house mosquito ( ) is the most   species in northern regions, while the southern house mosquito ( ) is abundant in southern regions, namely the tropics and subtropics. The genus   carries the pathogens that cause  ,  ,  , and encephalitis. Like  , it holds its body parallel to the resting surface, with the proboscis bent down. The wings are uniformly colored.   may be distinguished from   by its silver thorax with white markings and posterior spiracular bristles.

The life cycle may be as short as 10 days or, in cool weather, as long as several months. , the important carrier of the   responsible for yellow fever, has white bands on its legs and spots on its abdomen and thorax. This domestic species breeds in almost any kind of container, from   pots to discarded car-tire casings. The eastern salt marsh mosquito ( ), the black salt marsh mosquito ( ), and the summer salt marsh mosquito ( ) are important mosquitoes in coastal marsh areas that experience daily or occasional flooding with brackish or  . They are   breeders, strong fliers, and irritants to animals, including humans. Because mosquitoes are such prolific carriers of infectious diseases, preventing them from feeding on humans is considered to be a key global health strategy. The likelihood of disease transmission can be reduced through the use of mosquito repellent, long clothing that covers the arms and legs, screens in open doors and windows, and insecticide-treated mosquito bed nets. Mosquito populations can be controlled in part through the elimination of sources of standing water, which provide ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes. A surface film of oil can be applied to standing water to clog the breathing tubes of wrigglers, which may also be killed by larvicides.   using larvivorous  , such as the   ( ) is an option for some bodies of water. At times,   are used to destroy adult mosquitoes indoors. Aerial and truck-spraying applications of insecticides are commonly used in urban areas. Such applications are often done in the early evening to reduce the impact on pollinators, and ideally, they consist of insecticides that leave minimal residual effects, though regulations vary widely across the globe. Even in developed countries, commercial yard treatments are often less regulated than municipal applications and are frequently overused by the public. Nontarget   species and many   insects, including  , are often killed with broad or persistent insecticide treatments. Naled, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and other common insecticides used for mosquito control can make their way into waterways and harm aquatic invertebrates, affecting food webs far beyond the application site. Using mosquito insecticides in adverse weather conditions can   their negative environmental impacts. Researchers have investigated the possibility of manipulating mosquito populations to prevent the production of viable mosquito offspring, thereby reducing the number of mosquitoes. Researchers have also identified ways in which male mosquitoes may be   to transmit a gene to their offspring that causes the offspring to die before becoming sexually mature. Scientists have found that female mosquitoes are less attracted to humans when exposed to small   related to the   molecule neuropeptide Y. These compounds could be emitted via dispensers in areas where mosquitoes are abundant, helping to deter them from biting humans.

Nymphs are devoured in turn by many carnivorous  , especially  . Winged mayflies have large   eyes, short, bristlelike antennae, and functionless mouthparts and digestive tracts. Once mayflies enter the winged stages they cannot feed. Their membranous wings include a large, triangular front pair and a much smaller, rounded hind pair. In a few species, the hind pair is extremely reduced or absent. In repose, the wings are held together upright over the body like those of a  . The adult mayfly has two or three threadlike tails, usually as long as, or longer than, the body.  characters include a single claw terminating each of the six legs. The surface of the thoracic region of the body is strongly rounded outward and bears the developing wings in external pads on the upper surface. The abdominal region is usually long and slender. Gills are attached to the outer edge of the upper surface of some of the ten segments into which the body is divided. The body of the nymph terminates in three, less often two, slender tails. Adult mayflies of North American   in body length,   of tails, from 2.5 mm (0.1 inch) for   to 32 mm (more than an inch) for  . Worldwide, about 2,500 species of mayflies have been described, about 700 of them from   north of Mexico. The order is represented on all continents except Antarctica. In areas of high biological productivity (e.g., gravel-bottomed, hard-water, temperate-zone streams), as many as 1,400 nymphs have been found in one square foot of surface, and one gravel riffle has yielded as many as 33 species. The life cycle of mayflies consists of four stages: egg, nymph, subimago, and imago. Eggs, which vary widely in size and surface detail, may be oblong, oval, or rounded. Depending on the species, a female may produce fewer than 50 or more than 10,000 eggs. Eggs are laid in water and either settle to the bottom or adhere to some submerged object. They often hatch in about two weeks but may, under certain circumstances, undergo a period of varying duration in which no growth occurs. This cessation of growth, known as  , is a highly effective   that enables the insects to avoid environmental conditions hostile to developing nymphs or to emerging winged stages. Nymphal life may be as short as two weeks or as long as two years, although an annual cycle is most common. As many as 50   (periodic   of skin) may occur, depending on the species and the  . When growth is complete, the nymphal skin splits down the back and a winged form, called the  , or dun, emerges. The subimago flies from the surface of the water to some sheltered resting place nearby. After an interval lasting a few minutes to several days, but usually overnight, the skin is shed for the last time, and the  , or adult stage (sometimes called a spinner), emerges. Mayflies are the only insects that molt after developing functional wings. The subimago resembles the imago in overall appearance, although it is softer and duller in colour than the adult. The wings of the subimago, generally rather  , are tinted with gray, blue, yellow, or olive. Heavy pigmentation along the veins may give the wings of the subimago a mottled appearance that rarely persists in the imago. Legs and tails of the subimago are shorter than are those of the imago. It is often incorrectly assumed that the two stages are different species. Mating takes place soon after the final molt. In most species death ensues shortly after mating and   (egg deposition). Winged existence may last only a few hours, although   males may live long enough to engage in mating flights on two successive days, and female imagos that retain their eggs may live long enough to mate on either of two successive days. Groups of male imagoes perform a mating flight, or dance, over water as dusk approaches, flying into any breeze or air current. Individuals may   up and forward, then float downward and repeat the performance. Females soon join the  , rising and falling as the dance continues. The male approaches the female from below and behind and grasps her thorax with his elongated front legs. Mating is completed on the wing. After her release by the male, the female deposits her eggs and dies. A few species are ovoviviparous—i.e., eggs hatch within the body of the female generally as she floats, dying, on the surface of a stream or pond. Methods of oviposition vary. Some species drop the rounded egg mass from a height of several feet in a manoeuvre suggestive of dive-bombing, whereas in others, the female flies low over the water’s surface, striking it at intervals with the tip of her abdomen and washing off a few eggs each time she strikes the water. Still other females extrude the eggs from two oviducts as two long packets, which usually adhere to each other. They may be dropped from a foot or more above the water, but more often, the female falls to the surface with wings extended and squeezes out the eggs as she dies. In a fourth type of oviposition, the female alights on some object protruding from the water and crawls under the surface, depositing the eggs while submerged. Females, unless they drop the eggs from a height of several feet, are   to feeding fishes. Mayflies sometimes mistake blacktopped roads for streams, forming swarms over them, and drop eggs on road surfaces. Mayfly nymphs are preyed upon by carnivorous   and fishes. Winged stages are devoured in flight by  ,  , and predatory insects, including  ,  , and hornets. When at rest, mayflies may be preyed upon by  , beetles, birds, and certain  , especially   in North America. During their transformation to the adult stage and especially during oviposition by females, mayflies are vulnerable to   by fishes; artificial lures used by fishermen are patterned after them.

In all organisms the essence of fertilization is, in fact, the fusion of the   material of two different    , or  , each of which carries half the number of   typical of the  . The most   form of fertilization, found in microorganisms and protozoans, consists of an exchange of genetic material between two cells. The first significant event in fertilization is the fusion of the   of the two gametes, resulting in the formation of a channel that allows the passage of material from one   to the other. Fertilization in advanced   is preceded by  , during which   is transferred to, and establishes contact with, the female   or macrospore. Fusion in advanced   is usually followed by penetration of the egg by a single spermatozoon. The result of fertilization is a cell ( ) capable of undergoing cell division to form a new individual. The fusion of two gametes initiates several reactions in the egg. One of these causes a change in the egg membrane(s), so that the attachment of and penetration by more than one spermatozoon cannot occur. In species in which more than one spermatozoon normally enters an egg ( ), only one spermatozoal nucleus actually merges with the egg nucleus. The most important result of fertilization is egg activation, which allows the egg to undergo  . Activation, however, does not necessarily require the intervention of a spermatozoon; during  , in which fertilization does not occur, activation of an egg may be accomplished through the intervention of physical and chemical agents.   such as  ,  , and   normally reproduce by parthenogenesis. In plants, certain chemicals produced by the egg may attract spermatozoa. In animals, with the possible exception of some   (coelenterates), it appears likely that contact between eggs and spermatozoa depends on random  . On the other hand, the gelatinous coats that surround the eggs of many animals exert a trapping action on spermatozoa, thus increasing the chances for successful sperm-egg interaction. The eggs of marine invertebrates, especially  , are classical objects for the study of fertilization. These transparent eggs are valuable for studies observing living cells and for biochemical and molecular investigations because the time of fertilization can be accurately fixed, the   of many eggs occurs at about the same rate under suitable conditions, and large quantities of the eggs are obtainable. The eggs of some   and   also have been used with favourable results. Maturation is the final step in the production of functional eggs ( ) that can associate with a spermatozoon and develop a reaction that prevents the entry of more than one spermatozoon. In addition, the   of a mature egg can support the changes that lead to fusion of spermatozoal and egg nuclei and initiate embryonic development. Certain components of an egg’s surface, especially the  cortical granules, are associated with a mature condition. Cortical granules of sea urchin eggs, aligned beneath the   membrane (thin, soft, pliable layer) of mature eggs, have a diameter of 0.8–1.0 micron (0.0008–0.001 millimetre) and are surrounded by a membrane similar in structure to the   surrounding the egg. Cortical granules are formed in a cell component known as a  , from which they migrate to the surface of the maturing egg. The surface of a   egg has the ability to affect the passage of light unequally in different directions; this property, called  , is an indication that the molecules   the surface layers are arranged in a definite way. Since birefringence appears as an egg matures, it is likely that the properties of a mature egg membrane are associated with specific molecular arrangements. A mature egg is able to support the formation of a zygote nucleus; i.e., the result of fusion of spermatozoal and egg nuclei. In most eggs the process of reduction of chromosomal number ( ) is not completed prior to fertilization. In such cases the fertilizing spermatozoon remains beneath the egg surface until meiosis in the egg has been completed, after which changes and movements that lead to fusion and the formation of a zygote occur. The surfaces of most animal eggs are surrounded by envelopes, which may be soft gelatinous coats (as in echinoderms and some amphibians) or thick membranes (as in  ,  , and mammals). In order to reach the egg surface, therefore, spermatozoa must penetrate these envelopes; indeed, spermatozoa contain   (organic catalysts) that break them down. In some cases (e.g., fishes and insects) there is a channel, or micropyle, in the envelope, through which a spermatozoon can reach the egg. The jelly coats of echinoderm and   eggs consist of complex   called sulfated mucopolysaccharides. The envelope of a mammalian egg is more complex. The egg is surrounded by a thick coat composed of a carbohydrate protein complex called  . The zona is surrounded by an outer envelope, the  corona radiata, which is many cell layers thick and formed by follicle cells adhering to the oocyte before it leaves the ovarian follicle. Although it once was postulated that the jelly coat of an echinoderm egg contains a substance ( ) thought to have an important role not only in the establishment of sperm-egg interaction but also in egg activation, fertilizin now has been shown identical with jelly-coat material, rather than a substance continuously   from it. Yet there is evidence that the egg envelopes do play a role in fertilization; i.e., contact with the egg coat elicits the acrosome reaction (described below) in spermatozoa.

This biological species concept is widely used in biology and related fields of study. There are more than 20 other different species concepts, however. Some examples include the ecological species concept, which describes a species as a group of organisms framed by the resources they depend on (in other words, their  ), and the genetic species concept, which considers all organisms capable of inheriting   from one another within a common   and the amount of genetic difference between   of that species. Like the biological species concept, the genetic species concept considers which individuals are capable of interbreeding, as well as the amount of genetic difference between populations of that species, but it may also be used to estimate when the species originated. The   of species originates in  , where the species is the fundamental unit of classification recognized by the International Commission of Zoological  . Every species is assigned a standard two-part name of   and species. The genus is the generic name that includes closely related species; the gray  , for example, is classified as   and is a close relative of the   found in   and designated as  , their systematic relation indicated by their sharing the same genus name,  . Similarly, genera that have shared   (or traits) are classified in the same taxonomic family; related families are placed in the same order; related orders are placed in the same class; and related classes are placed in the same phylum. This classification system is a   applied to all animals and plants, as originally set forth by the Swedish naturalist   in the 18th century. Organisms are grouped into species partly according to their  , or external, similarities, but more important in classifying sexually reproducing organisms is the organisms’ ability to successfully interbreed. Individuals of a single species can mate and produce viable offspring with one another but almost never with members of other species. Separate species have been known to produce hybrid offspring (for example, the   and the   producing the  ), but, because the   are almost always inviable or sterile, the interbreeding is not considered successful. Interbreeding only within the species is of great importance for evolution in that individuals of one species share a common     that members of other species do not. Within a single pool there is always a certain amount of   among individuals, and those whose genetic variations leave them at a disadvantage in a particular   tend to be eliminated in favour of those with advantageous variations. This process of   results in the gene pool’s evolving in such a way that the advantageous variations become the norm.

Fats are usually solid at ordinary temperatures, such as 25 °C (77 °F), but they begin to liquefy at somewhat higher temperatures. Chemically, fats are identical to animal and   oils, consisting primarily of  , which are esters formed by the reaction of three molecules of fatty acids with one molecule of   (   ). Together with oils, fats   one of the three principal classes of foodstuffs, the others being proteins and carbohydrates. Nearly all cells contain these basic substances. Fat is sometimes called nature’s storehouse of   because on a weight basis it contains more than twice as much energy as does   or  . It is probably as storehouses or depots of concentrated energy that fats appear in   reproductive organs, such as pollen grains and seeds. It is this fat that humans recover from plants for use as   or in industry. The fat content of the nonreproductive tissue of plants is usually so low that recovery is impracticable.   much dietary fat comes from natural foodstuffs without being separated from the other plant materials with which it occurs. The proportion of fat in these foodstuffs varies from 0.1 percent in white potatoes to 70 percent in some nut kernels. More than 90 percent of the fat recovered in the world is obtained from about 20 species of plants and animals. Most of this separated fat is used eventually as human food. Consequently, fat technology deals largely with the separation and processing of fats into forms acceptable to the various dietary customs in the countries in which they are to be used. (For further information on the subject,    .) Humans have used many natural fats for both food and nonfood purposes since prehistoric times. The Egyptians, for example, used   as a lubricant in moving heavy building materials. They also made axle greases from fat and lime, mixed with other materials, as early as 1400  . Homer mentions oil as an aid to  , and Pliny talks about hard and soft soaps. Candles and lamps using oil or   have been used for thousands of years. The commercial uses of fats have increased in number as the understanding of the chemical nature of fats has expanded.  , a Swedish chemist, discovered in 1779 that glycerol could be obtained from olive oil by heating it with litharge (lead monoxide), but it was not until about 1815 that the French chemist   (1786–1889) demonstrated the chemical nature of fats and oils. A few years later the separation of liquid acids from solid acids was accomplished.   was invented by the French chemist  , who in 1869 won a prize offered by   for a satisfactory   substitute. The modern   process had its origin in research in the late 19th century that led to the establishment of the vegetable-oil-shortening industry and a variety of industrial applications. After  , organic chemists gained extensive knowledge first of     and then of glyceride compositions. Growth of the   stimulated a simultaneous expansion of the use of fats as raw materials and as intermediates for scores of new chemicals. The modern application of many organic chemical reactions to fats and fatty acids formed the foundation of a new and rapidly growing fatty-chemicals industry. The universal distribution of fats in plant and animal   suggests physiological roles that go beyond their function as a fuel supply for the cells. In animals the most evident function of fats is that of a food reserve to supply energy (through   enzymatic oxidation—that is, combination with oxygen catalyzed by  ). The storage of fat in vegetable seeds can be explained similarly on the basis that it is a food reserve for the embryo. It is not so easy, however, to account for the presence of large quantities of fat in such fruits as olives, avocados, and palms; much of this fat is probably lost or destroyed before the seed germinates. Fats fulfill other valuable functions in plants and animals. Subcutaneous deposits of fat insulate animals against cold because of the low rate of   in fat, a property especially important for animals living in cold waters or climates—e.g., whales, walruses, and bears. Fats that have been separated from tissues always contain small quantities of closely associated nonglyceride lipids such as phospholipids, sterols, vitamins A, D, and E, and various carotenoid pigments. Many of these substances are vital emulsifying agents or growth factors. Others function as agents that prevent deterioration of fats in plant tissues and seeds caused by destructive combination with oxygen. These minor   probably are present in the fats as a result of their physical solubility, and thus fats serve as carriers for these substances in animal diets. Many animals require some fat containing one or more of the essential fatty acids ( ,  , and to a limited extent  ) to prevent the physical symptoms of essential-fatty-acid deficiency   by skin lesions, scaliness, poor hair growth, and low growth rates. These essential fatty acids must be supplied in the diet since they cannot be synthesized in the body. The  , discovered by the Nobel laureate U.S. von Euler of Sweden, are hormonelike   derived from arachidonic acid. These biologically active fatty acids, which are present in very minute quantities in animal tissues, apparently are involved in contraction of smooth muscles, enzyme activity in    , function of the  , regulation of   and  , function of steroid hormones, fat mobilization in  , and a number of other vital functions.

This order of insects is second in size only to  , the beetles. Because of their day-flying habits and bright colours, the butterflies are more familiar than the chiefly night-flying and dull-coloured moths, but the latter are far more varied and  . The skippers are a worldwide group intermediate between butterflies and moths. With the exception of a few moths, all adult lepidopterans have two pairs of wings. The name Lepidoptera is derived from the Greek, meaning “scaly winged,” and refers to the characteristic covering of microscopic dustlike   on the wings. The life cycle of lepidopterans consists of four stages:  ,   ( ),   (chrysalis), and adult (imago). The larvae do most of the eating, with the majority feeding on foliage, although many species eat  ,  ,  , or  . A number of moth and a few   larvae are serious   in agriculture and forestry. The adults of many species are important for their role in  , which occurs as they visit flowers for  . In most land   the lepidopterans are ecologically important because they transform large amounts of   matter into   matter and in turn serve as food for many other groups of animals. Many members of the order, especially the butterflies, have appealed to the human imagination for thousands of years as   of fragile and   beauty. References to them abound in literature, and they have been depicted in many paintings, have inspired the designs of  , ornaments, and  , and have even occurred in many heraldic devices and on postage stamps. Moths, butterflies, and skippers show great   in size and development rates. Some moths have wingspans as small as 4 mm (0.13 inch), whereas the largest moths and butterflies measure nearly 30 cm (about 1 foot). Fast-developing species may complete their development in as little as three weeks, while slower ones may require as long as two or even three years. Lepidopterans live on every continent except  . Though they are far more numerous and diversified in the tropics, some species survive at the limits of polar vegetation. There are many successful species in nearly every  , from arid   and high mountaintops to   and tropical  . Most have become adapted for life in relatively restricted ecological   and may be limited to only one or a small group of food plants, often to only a single part of one plant. They are therefore seldom abundant in more than one type of  . However, a few species have broader food habits and may occasionally reach peaks of abnormal abundance and defoliate large areas of deciduous   or  . Some of the insects most injurious to human interests in agriculture and forestry are members of the Lepidoptera. The large family-level groups and many smaller ones are   in distribution, with   (family Noctuidae),   (family Geometridae),   (family Pyralidae),   (family Nymphalidae), and   (family Hesperiidae) being dominant elements of the   fauna everywhere. A few families are characteristically more abundant in one   than in others. Central and   are characterized by great diversity of American false tiger moths (family Notodonidae) and ctenuchid moths (family Arctiidae). The North American (Nearctic) and Eurasian (Palaearctic) families show much evidence of close connections, chiefly between Asia and western  . Each region has, however, many distinctive genera. Many lepidopterans exist only in isolated colonies as  relict (remnant) populations, cut off from relatives elsewhere by geologic or climatic changes.   and   have unusually   relict populations of the primitive   (family Micropterigidae) and  , or ghost moths (family Hepialidae). In North America, Europe, and Asia, many relict species have survived since the last   on isolated southern mountaintops. Many hundreds of Lepidoptera injure plants useful to humans, including some of the most important sources of food, fabrics, fodder, and timber. The great majority of the   are moths, and the   life stage is always the larva. However, unlike members of other insect orders, lepidopterans do not act as carriers of  , nor are any of them parasites of or injurious to humans. However, some species feed on open   or bodily secretions of wild or domestic animals.  The list of valuable plants subject to damage by lepidopterans is a long one, including many grains,   and  ,  ,  , some root crops and   crops, many fruits, and timber and shade  . The damage may involve the leaves, stems, roots, or fruit. Woolens, furs, silk, and even feathers are eaten by fungus moths (   ) of several genera (clothes moths). The   ( ) causes considerable damage in  . A few Lepidoptera are directly   to humans. Nearly all   is obtained from the   ( ), which is originally from China. Other silks such as shantung and tussah are the products of various Asiatic giant   (family  ). The larvae and sometimes the adults of a few species are used for food. The larvae of one   ( , or  ) are collected in large quantities in the Congo, and the 10-cm (4-inch) caterpillars of giant skippers (family Megathymidae), known in   as  , are both consumed domestically and canned and exported for   as  . The South American   ( ) has been highly beneficial in   control, clearing more than 150 million ha (60 million acres) in Australia of alien   cactus. Doubtless, humans also benefit from much unrecognized weed eating by caterpillars and flower pollination by adults. Many lepidopterans are valuable in biological research, including work in  ,  , systematics,  , and  . Much of the present knowledge of   controls of insect development has come from studies of the silkworm moth and its relatives.

They are also  -specific; for instance, within a single organism,   proteins differ from those of the   and  . A protein   is very large compared with molecules of sugar or salt and consists of many   joined together to form long chains, much as beads are arranged on a string. There are about 20 different amino acids that occur naturally in proteins. Proteins of similar function have similar amino acid   and sequence. Although it is not yet possible to explain all of the functions of a protein from its amino acid sequence, established correlations between structure and function can be attributed to the properties of the amino acids that compose proteins.  can synthesize all of the amino acids;   cannot, even though all of them are essential for life. Plants can grow in a medium containing inorganic nutrients that provide  ,  , and other substances essential for growth. They utilize the   in the air during the process of   to form organic   such as  . Animals, however, must obtain organic nutrients from outside sources. Because the protein content of most plants is low, very large amounts of plant material are required by animals, such as   (e.g., cows), that eat only plant material to meet their amino acid requirements. Nonruminant animals, including humans, obtain proteins principally from animals and their products—e.g., meat, milk, and eggs. The seeds of legumes are increasingly being used to prepare inexpensive protein-rich   (   ). The protein content of animal organs is usually much higher than that of the blood  . Muscles, for example, contain about 30 percent protein, the liver 20 to 30 percent, and   30 percent. Higher percentages of protein are found in hair, bones, and other organs and tissues with a low   content. The quantity of free amino acids and   in animals is much smaller than the amount of protein; protein molecules are produced in   by the stepwise alignment of amino acids and are released into the body fluids only after   is complete. The high protein content of some organs does not mean that the importance of proteins is related to their amount in an organism or  ; on the contrary, some of the most important proteins, such as   and  , occur in extremely small amounts. The importance of proteins is related principally to their function. All enzymes identified thus far are proteins. Enzymes, which are the   of all metabolic reactions, enable an organism to build up the chemical substances necessary for life—proteins,  , carbohydrates, and  —to convert them into other substances, and to degrade them. Life without enzymes is not possible. There are several protein hormones with important regulatory functions. In all vertebrates, the respiratory protein   acts as   carrier in the  , transporting oxygen from the   to body organs and tissues. A large group of structural proteins maintains and protects the structure of the animal body.

It occurs commonly among lower   and     (particularly  ,  ,  ,  , and  ) and rarely among higher  . An   produced parthenogenetically may be either haploid (i.e., with one set of dissimilar  ) or diploid (i.e., with a paired set of chromosomes). Parthenogenic species may be   (that is, incapable of  ) or facultative (that is, capable of switching between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction depending upon environmental conditions). The term   is taken from the Greek words  , meaning “virgin,” and  , meaning “origin.” More than 2,000 species are thought to reproduce parthenogenically. Parthenogenesis is sometimes considered to be an asexual form of reproduction; however, it may be more accurately described as an “incomplete form of sexual reproduction,” since offspring of parthenogenic species develop from gametes. Gametes are reproductive cells that result from meiosis (or reduction division)—in which a specialized cell with a (diploid) double set of chromosomes undergoes two fissions of its  . Meiosis gives rise to four gametes, or sex cells, which are haploid—in that each possesses half the number of chromosomes of the original cell (   ). Parthenogenesis can operate on either a haploid or a diploid cell. In haploid parthenogenesis, a rare form of parthenogenesis that occurs in a few species of bees, nematodes, and plants,   develop from haploid eggs to produce haploid adults. On the other hand, the process of diploid parthenogenesis, a more common and varied form of the phenomenon, may proceed along two pathways. Automixis (automictic parthenogenesis) is a postmeiotic process in which a haploid cell may either duplicate its chromosomes or join with another haploid cell. In both cases, diploid zygotes develop and grow into diploid adults. Such organisms are not true clones of the mother, however, because the meiotic process separates and recombines the genetic material. A second form of diploid parthenogenesis,   (apomicitic parthenogenesis), forgoes complete meiosis altogether. Instead, two genetically identical diploid egg cells are produced from a parent cell through   (the process of cell duplication), and one or more of these daughter cells, which are both diploid and   (that is, genetically identical) of the original parent cell, develop into a diploid offspring. Diploid parthenogenesis occurs in insects such as aphids as well as in some rotifers and flowering plants (    and  ). In the insect order   (which includes bees, wasps, and ants), parthenogenesis can take one of three forms: arrhenotoky, thelytoky, and deuterotoky. In arrhenotoky, haploid males are produced from unfertilized eggs laid by mated (impregnated) females or by so-called secondary, or supplementary, queens, which have not been impregnated. In thelytoky, which occurs in many species of the suborder Symphyta (a group that includes the  , the  , and the  ), unmated females produce males. In deuterotoky, unmated females of some Symphyta produce females as well as males. The occurrence of these forms is not always mutually  . For example, in   (bees), about 1 percent of the eggs laid by secondary queens may be female. Sometimes associated with arrhenotoky, thelytoky, and deuterotoky is pseudoarrhenotoky (or paternal genome elimination). Pseudoarrhenotoky is a nonparthenogenic form of   that occurs in the hymenopteran superfamily Chalcidoidea (a group of small parasitic wasps) and in some mites, Like arrhenotoky, pseudoarrhenotoky results in the production of haploid males. In this process, development begins as diploid organisms within fertilized eggs; however, as development progresses, males become haploid after the paternal contribution to the genome has been lost, eliminated, or deactivated. A number of parthenogenic variations have been observed. Some aphids and    undergo a type of parthenogenesis called heterogony or cyclic parthenogenesis. In these species, generations of offspring produced from fertilized eggs may alternate with those produced from unfertilized ones. Such an   in both groups of insects is thought to result partly from seasonal temperature changes, with eggs produced through sexual reproduction having a greater ability to withstand the winter cold. They lie dormant until temperatures rise. Pseudogamy (gynogenesis, or sperm-dependent parthenogenesis) is another variation, which appears in the life cycle of a few insects, mites, and salamanders as well as the flatworm  .   is hermaphroditic and may be diploid (which can reproduce sexually) or   (that is, with one or more additional sets of chromosomes). Whereas sexual reproduction requires   for fertilization, parthenogenic reproduction in this species involves sperm only to   the initial development of the egg; the sperm’s genetic material is not used.

Food serves multiple functions in most living organisms. For example, it provides materials that are metabolized to supply the   required for the absorption and translocation of  , for the synthesis of   materials, for movement and  , for   of waste products, and for all other activities of the organism. Food also provides materials from which all the structural and   components of the living cell can be assembled. Living organisms differ in the particular substances that they require as food, in the manner in which they synthesize food substances or obtain them from the surrounding  , and in the functions that these substances carry out in their cells. Nevertheless, general patterns can be discerned in the nutritional process throughout the living world and in the types of nutrients that are required to sustain  . These patterns are the subject of this article. For a full discussion of the nutritional requirements of humans in particular,   the article  . Living organisms can be categorized by the way in which the functions of food are carried out in their bodies. Thus, organisms such as green   and some   that need only   for   can be called   organisms; and organisms, including all  ,  , and most bacteria, that require both inorganic and   for growth are called  . Other classifications have been used to include various other nutritional patterns. In one scheme, organisms are classified according to the energy source they utilize. Phototrophic, or  , organisms trap   energy and convert it to  , whereas  , or chemosynthetic, organisms utilize inorganic or organic   to supply their energy requirements. If the  -donor materials utilized to form reduced   consist of inorganic compounds, the organism is said to be  ; if organic, the organism is  organotrophic. Combinations of these patterns may also be used to describe organisms. Higher plants, for example, are  photolithotrophic; i.e., they utilize light energy, with the inorganic     serving as the ultimate electron donor. Certain photosynthetic bacteria that cannot utilize water as the electron donor and require organic compounds for this purpose are called  photoorganotrophs. Animals, according to this classification, are  chemoorganotrophs; i.e., they utilize   to supply energy and organic compounds as electron donors. Despite wide variations in the nature of the external energy source utilized by various organisms, all organisms form from their external energy source an immediate source of energy, the chemical compound   (ATP). This energy-rich compound is common to all cells. Through the breaking of its high-energy   bonds and thus by its   to a less energy-rich compound, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), ATP provides the energy for the chemical and mechanical work required by an organism. The energy requirements of organisms can be measured in either   or  .

These immature, active forms are structurally different from the adults and are adapted to a different  . In some species the larva is free-living and the adult is an attached or nonmobile form; in others the larva is aquatic and the adult lives on land. In forms with nonmobile adults, the mobile larva increases the geographic distribution of the species. Such larvae have well-developed locomotor structures. A larva sometimes functions as a food gatherer—in many species the larval stage occurs at a time when food is abundant—and has a well-developed alimentary system. It stores food so that the transformation to the adult stage can occur. Some larvae function in both dispersion and nutrition. The amount of time in the   spent in the larval stage varies among species. Some have long larval periods, either hatching early, metamorphosing into adults late, or both. Some organisms have a short-lived larval phase or no larvae at all. Larvae appear in a variety of forms. Many invertebrates (e.g., cnidarians) have a simple ciliated larva called a  . Flukes have several larval stages, and annelids, mollusks, and crustaceans have various larval forms. The larval forms of the various insects are called caterpillars, grubs, maggots, and  s.

Typical castes in insect societies include the queen, the sexual female responsible for reproduction; the workers, the usually sterile caretakers of the queen and her eggs and larvae; and the soldiers, defenders of the colony (and also sterile). Morphological differences between castes, which enable their members’ performance of different tasks, are sometimes noted; e.g., the pollen basket on the legs of the worker honeybee ( ) does not exist on the queen. In many insect species, differentiation of insect larvae into various castes is determined by diet, although hormonal and environmental factors can also affect development. Some insects also produce worker or soldier subcastes, which are morphologically and functionally distinct. The subcastes of   ants are among the best characterized. These ants are capable of producing minor and major subcastes; minors perform foraging duties, while majors, which have large bodies and heads, are involved primarily in defense. A reduction in the population of minors causes majors to take over their duties, thereby promoting colony survival. Eight species of   ants, all found in the southwestern  , produce a third subcaste, known as super majors (or supersoldiers); this subcaste may allow these species to utilize   food resources (e.g., large seeds) that other   are unable to access.

The human female reproductive cell is also usually called an ovum. The egg, like the male gamete, bears only a single (haploid) set of chromosomes.

The plant egg is never so disproportionately large, because the developing sporophyte embryo is nourished until self-supporting by the plant on which it is formed (in liverworts, mosses, and ferns by the gametophyte; in   plants by the sporophyte on which the   is parasitic). With the exception of those of some cnidarians (coelenterates), all animal eggs are enclosed by membranes, the innermost of which is called the  . The vitelline membrane is the only membrane in the eggs of various invertebrates—ctenophores, many worms, and echinoderms—and of certain lower chordates. All higher vertebrates and many invertebrates have one or more additional membranes. Insect eggs, for example, are covered by a thick, hard  , and the   egg is surrounded by a jelly layer. The   egg includes the vitelline membrane, the white of the egg, two egg shell membranes, and the outermost membrane, the shell. As pointed out above, this entire structure is commonly referred to as an egg. Mature eggs remain functional for a relatively short period of time, after which fertilization cannot occur. The eggs of most invertebrates,  , and   must be fertilized a few minutes after they are shed into the water; an exception is   eggs, which are viable for about 40 hours after their release. Most other animal eggs have life spans similar to that of the human egg—i.e., 12 to 24 hours.    .

Nymphs are devoured in turn by many carnivorous  , especially  . Winged mayflies have large   eyes, short, bristlelike antennae, and functionless mouthparts and digestive tracts. Once mayflies enter the winged stages they cannot feed. Their membranous wings include a large, triangular front pair and a much smaller, rounded hind pair. In a few species, the hind pair is extremely reduced or absent. In repose, the wings are held together upright over the body like those of a  . The adult mayfly has two or three threadlike tails, usually as long as, or longer than, the body.  characters include a single claw terminating each of the six legs. The surface of the thoracic region of the body is strongly rounded outward and bears the developing wings in external pads on the upper surface. The abdominal region is usually long and slender. Gills are attached to the outer edge of the upper surface of some of the ten segments into which the body is divided. The body of the nymph terminates in three, less often two, slender tails. Adult mayflies of North American   in body length,   of tails, from 2.5 mm (0.1 inch) for   to 32 mm (more than an inch) for  . Worldwide, about 2,500 species of mayflies have been described, about 700 of them from   north of Mexico. The order is represented on all continents except Antarctica. In areas of high biological productivity (e.g., gravel-bottomed, hard-water, temperate-zone streams), as many as 1,400 nymphs have been found in one square foot of surface, and one gravel riffle has yielded as many as 33 species. The life cycle of mayflies consists of four stages: egg, nymph, subimago, and imago. Eggs, which vary widely in size and surface detail, may be oblong, oval, or rounded. Depending on the species, a female may produce fewer than 50 or more than 10,000 eggs. Eggs are laid in water and either settle to the bottom or adhere to some submerged object. They often hatch in about two weeks but may, under certain circumstances, undergo a period of varying duration in which no growth occurs. This cessation of growth, known as  , is a highly effective   that enables the insects to avoid environmental conditions hostile to developing nymphs or to emerging winged stages. Nymphal life may be as short as two weeks or as long as two years, although an annual cycle is most common. As many as 50   (periodic   of skin) may occur, depending on the species and the  . When growth is complete, the nymphal skin splits down the back and a winged form, called the  , or dun, emerges. The subimago flies from the surface of the water to some sheltered resting place nearby. After an interval lasting a few minutes to several days, but usually overnight, the skin is shed for the last time, and the  , or adult stage (sometimes called a spinner), emerges. Mayflies are the only insects that molt after developing functional wings. The subimago resembles the imago in overall appearance, although it is softer and duller in colour than the adult. The wings of the subimago, generally rather  , are tinted with gray, blue, yellow, or olive. Heavy pigmentation along the veins may give the wings of the subimago a mottled appearance that rarely persists in the imago. Legs and tails of the subimago are shorter than are those of the imago. It is often incorrectly assumed that the two stages are different species. Mating takes place soon after the final molt. In most species death ensues shortly after mating and   (egg deposition). Winged existence may last only a few hours, although   males may live long enough to engage in mating flights on two successive days, and female imagos that retain their eggs may live long enough to mate on either of two successive days. Groups of male imagoes perform a mating flight, or dance, over water as dusk approaches, flying into any breeze or air current. Individuals may   up and forward, then float downward and repeat the performance. Females soon join the  , rising and falling as the dance continues. The male approaches the female from below and behind and grasps her thorax with his elongated front legs. Mating is completed on the wing. After her release by the male, the female deposits her eggs and dies. A few species are ovoviviparous—i.e., eggs hatch within the body of the female generally as she floats, dying, on the surface of a stream or pond. Methods of oviposition vary. Some species drop the rounded egg mass from a height of several feet in a manoeuvre suggestive of dive-bombing, whereas in others, the female flies low over the water’s surface, striking it at intervals with the tip of her abdomen and washing off a few eggs each time she strikes the water. Still other females extrude the eggs from two oviducts as two long packets, which usually adhere to each other. They may be dropped from a foot or more above the water, but more often, the female falls to the surface with wings extended and squeezes out the eggs as she dies. In a fourth type of oviposition, the female alights on some object protruding from the water and crawls under the surface, depositing the eggs while submerged. Females, unless they drop the eggs from a height of several feet, are   to feeding fishes. Mayflies sometimes mistake blacktopped roads for streams, forming swarms over them, and drop eggs on road surfaces. Mayfly nymphs are preyed upon by carnivorous   and fishes. Winged stages are devoured in flight by  ,  , and predatory insects, including  ,  , and hornets. When at rest, mayflies may be preyed upon by  , beetles, birds, and certain  , especially   in North America. During their transformation to the adult stage and especially during oviposition by females, mayflies are vulnerable to   by fishes; artificial lures used by fishermen are patterned after them.

In all organisms the essence of fertilization is, in fact, the fusion of the   material of two different    , or  , each of which carries half the number of   typical of the  . The most   form of fertilization, found in microorganisms and protozoans, consists of an exchange of genetic material between two cells. The first significant event in fertilization is the fusion of the   of the two gametes, resulting in the formation of a channel that allows the passage of material from one   to the other. Fertilization in advanced   is preceded by  , during which   is transferred to, and establishes contact with, the female   or macrospore. Fusion in advanced   is usually followed by penetration of the egg by a single spermatozoon. The result of fertilization is a cell ( ) capable of undergoing cell division to form a new individual. The fusion of two gametes initiates several reactions in the egg. One of these causes a change in the egg membrane(s), so that the attachment of and penetration by more than one spermatozoon cannot occur. In species in which more than one spermatozoon normally enters an egg ( ), only one spermatozoal nucleus actually merges with the egg nucleus. The most important result of fertilization is egg activation, which allows the egg to undergo  . Activation, however, does not necessarily require the intervention of a spermatozoon; during  , in which fertilization does not occur, activation of an egg may be accomplished through the intervention of physical and chemical agents.   such as  ,  , and   normally reproduce by parthenogenesis. In plants, certain chemicals produced by the egg may attract spermatozoa. In animals, with the possible exception of some   (coelenterates), it appears likely that contact between eggs and spermatozoa depends on random  . On the other hand, the gelatinous coats that surround the eggs of many animals exert a trapping action on spermatozoa, thus increasing the chances for successful sperm-egg interaction. The eggs of marine invertebrates, especially  , are classical objects for the study of fertilization. These transparent eggs are valuable for studies observing living cells and for biochemical and molecular investigations because the time of fertilization can be accurately fixed, the   of many eggs occurs at about the same rate under suitable conditions, and large quantities of the eggs are obtainable. The eggs of some   and   also have been used with favourable results. Maturation is the final step in the production of functional eggs ( ) that can associate with a spermatozoon and develop a reaction that prevents the entry of more than one spermatozoon. In addition, the   of a mature egg can support the changes that lead to fusion of spermatozoal and egg nuclei and initiate embryonic development. Certain components of an egg’s surface, especially the  cortical granules, are associated with a mature condition. Cortical granules of sea urchin eggs, aligned beneath the   membrane (thin, soft, pliable layer) of mature eggs, have a diameter of 0.8–1.0 micron (0.0008–0.001 millimetre) and are surrounded by a membrane similar in structure to the   surrounding the egg. Cortical granules are formed in a cell component known as a  , from which they migrate to the surface of the maturing egg. The surface of a   egg has the ability to affect the passage of light unequally in different directions; this property, called  , is an indication that the molecules   the surface layers are arranged in a definite way. Since birefringence appears as an egg matures, it is likely that the properties of a mature egg membrane are associated with specific molecular arrangements. A mature egg is able to support the formation of a zygote nucleus; i.e., the result of fusion of spermatozoal and egg nuclei. In most eggs the process of reduction of chromosomal number ( ) is not completed prior to fertilization. In such cases the fertilizing spermatozoon remains beneath the egg surface until meiosis in the egg has been completed, after which changes and movements that lead to fusion and the formation of a zygote occur. The surfaces of most animal eggs are surrounded by envelopes, which may be soft gelatinous coats (as in echinoderms and some amphibians) or thick membranes (as in  ,  , and mammals). In order to reach the egg surface, therefore, spermatozoa must penetrate these envelopes; indeed, spermatozoa contain   (organic catalysts) that break them down. In some cases (e.g., fishes and insects) there is a channel, or micropyle, in the envelope, through which a spermatozoon can reach the egg. The jelly coats of echinoderm and   eggs consist of complex   called sulfated mucopolysaccharides. The envelope of a mammalian egg is more complex. The egg is surrounded by a thick coat composed of a carbohydrate protein complex called  . The zona is surrounded by an outer envelope, the  corona radiata, which is many cell layers thick and formed by follicle cells adhering to the oocyte before it leaves the ovarian follicle. Although it once was postulated that the jelly coat of an echinoderm egg contains a substance ( ) thought to have an important role not only in the establishment of sperm-egg interaction but also in egg activation, fertilizin now has been shown identical with jelly-coat material, rather than a substance continuously   from it. Yet there is evidence that the egg envelopes do play a role in fertilization; i.e., contact with the egg coat elicits the acrosome reaction (described below) in spermatozoa.

This order of insects is second in size only to  , the beetles. Because of their day-flying habits and bright colours, the butterflies are more familiar than the chiefly night-flying and dull-coloured moths, but the latter are far more varied and  . The skippers are a worldwide group intermediate between butterflies and moths. With the exception of a few moths, all adult lepidopterans have two pairs of wings. The name Lepidoptera is derived from the Greek, meaning “scaly winged,” and refers to the characteristic covering of microscopic dustlike   on the wings. The life cycle of lepidopterans consists of four stages:  ,   ( ),   (chrysalis), and adult (imago). The larvae do most of the eating, with the majority feeding on foliage, although many species eat  ,  ,  , or  . A number of moth and a few   larvae are serious   in agriculture and forestry. The adults of many species are important for their role in  , which occurs as they visit flowers for  . In most land   the lepidopterans are ecologically important because they transform large amounts of   matter into   matter and in turn serve as food for many other groups of animals. Many members of the order, especially the butterflies, have appealed to the human imagination for thousands of years as   of fragile and   beauty. References to them abound in literature, and they have been depicted in many paintings, have inspired the designs of  , ornaments, and  , and have even occurred in many heraldic devices and on postage stamps. Moths, butterflies, and skippers show great   in size and development rates. Some moths have wingspans as small as 4 mm (0.13 inch), whereas the largest moths and butterflies measure nearly 30 cm (about 1 foot). Fast-developing species may complete their development in as little as three weeks, while slower ones may require as long as two or even three years. Lepidopterans live on every continent except  . Though they are far more numerous and diversified in the tropics, some species survive at the limits of polar vegetation. There are many successful species in nearly every  , from arid   and high mountaintops to   and tropical  . Most have become adapted for life in relatively restricted ecological   and may be limited to only one or a small group of food plants, often to only a single part of one plant. They are therefore seldom abundant in more than one type of  . However, a few species have broader food habits and may occasionally reach peaks of abnormal abundance and defoliate large areas of deciduous   or  . Some of the insects most injurious to human interests in agriculture and forestry are members of the Lepidoptera. The large family-level groups and many smaller ones are   in distribution, with   (family Noctuidae),   (family Geometridae),   (family Pyralidae),   (family Nymphalidae), and   (family Hesperiidae) being dominant elements of the   fauna everywhere. A few families are characteristically more abundant in one   than in others. Central and   are characterized by great diversity of American false tiger moths (family Notodonidae) and ctenuchid moths (family Arctiidae). The North American (Nearctic) and Eurasian (Palaearctic) families show much evidence of close connections, chiefly between Asia and western  . Each region has, however, many distinctive genera. Many lepidopterans exist only in isolated colonies as  relict (remnant) populations, cut off from relatives elsewhere by geologic or climatic changes.   and   have unusually   relict populations of the primitive   (family Micropterigidae) and  , or ghost moths (family Hepialidae). In North America, Europe, and Asia, many relict species have survived since the last   on isolated southern mountaintops. Many hundreds of Lepidoptera injure plants useful to humans, including some of the most important sources of food, fabrics, fodder, and timber. The great majority of the   are moths, and the   life stage is always the larva.

By the end of the 20th century the   had spread to the western   region. Damage is less severe in its original European range, where the moth has several natural enemies. The heavy-bodied flightless female moth is white with black zigzag markings and has a wingspan of 38 to 50 mm (1.5 to 2 inches). The smaller, darker male is a strong flier. Eggs deposited in   during July are covered with a mass of buff-coloured hair from the female’s abdomen. They hatch the following spring. The flat, pale brown  , with tufts of stiff brown and yellow hairs on their sides, grow to 50 mm and are voracious feeders. They often completely strip trees of their   in several weeks. Unlike most   and  , the larvae are the main dispersal stage. Small larvae spin silk from glands in their mouthparts and hang from branches high up in trees. If the silk lines are long enough, the wind breaks them from the tree, and the silk acts as a  , carrying the young larvae to new, uninfested trees to feed. When larval development is complete, they crawl down the tree trunk, settle in leaf   at the base of the tree, and enter the pupal stage. The adult moth emerges from the   after about 10 days, completing the annual generation. A larger strain, the  Asian spongy moth, has a wingspan of about 90 mm. It poses an even greater threat than its European relative because the female can fly, enabling it to spread quickly, and the larvae, which range in colour from light to dark brown, will eat the leaves of coniferous as well as deciduous trees. It has defoliated millions of hectares of trees in Russia and China and was discovered in northwestern North America in 1991. Spraying of young larvae with either traditional or biological   remains the most effective means of controlling spongy moths. In 2022 the name "spongy moth" was formally adopted as the new common name for the species by the Entomological Society of America, replacing an ethnic slur for the   people.

This biological species concept is widely used in biology and related fields of study. There are more than 20 other different species concepts, however. Some examples include the ecological species concept, which describes a species as a group of organisms framed by the resources they depend on (in other words, their  ), and the genetic species concept, which considers all organisms capable of inheriting   from one another within a common   and the amount of genetic difference between   of that species. Like the biological species concept, the genetic species concept considers which individuals are capable of interbreeding, as well as the amount of genetic difference between populations of that species, but it may also be used to estimate when the species originated. The   of species originates in  , where the species is the fundamental unit of classification recognized by the International Commission of Zoological  . Every species is assigned a standard two-part name of   and species. The genus is the generic name that includes closely related species; the gray  , for example, is classified as   and is a close relative of the   found in   and designated as  , their systematic relation indicated by their sharing the same genus name,  . Similarly, genera that have shared   (or traits) are classified in the same taxonomic family; related families are placed in the same order; related orders are placed in the same class; and related classes are placed in the same phylum. This classification system is a   applied to all animals and plants, as originally set forth by the Swedish naturalist   in the 18th century. Organisms are grouped into species partly according to their  , or external, similarities, but more important in classifying sexually reproducing organisms is the organisms’ ability to successfully interbreed. Individuals of a single species can mate and produce viable offspring with one another but almost never with members of other species. Separate species have been known to produce hybrid offspring (for example, the   and the   producing the  ), but, because the   are almost always inviable or sterile, the interbreeding is not considered successful. Interbreeding only within the species is of great importance for evolution in that individuals of one species share a common     that members of other species do not. Within a single pool there is always a certain amount of   among individuals, and those whose genetic variations leave them at a disadvantage in a particular   tend to be eliminated in favour of those with advantageous variations. This process of   results in the gene pool’s evolving in such a way that the advantageous variations become the norm. Because genetic variations originate in individuals of a species and because those individuals pass on their variations only within the species, then it is at the species level that evolution takes place.

A protein   is very large compared with molecules of sugar or salt and consists of many   joined together to form long chains, much as beads are arranged on a string. There are about 20 different amino acids that occur naturally in proteins. Proteins of similar function have similar amino acid   and sequence. Although it is not yet possible to explain all of the functions of a protein from its amino acid sequence, established correlations between structure and function can be attributed to the properties of the amino acids that compose proteins.  can synthesize all of the amino acids;   cannot, even though all of them are essential for life.

Because the protein content of most plants is low, very large amounts of plant material are required by animals, such as   (e.g., cows), that eat only plant material to meet their amino acid requirements. Nonruminant animals, including humans, obtain proteins principally from animals and their products—e.g., meat, milk, and eggs. The seeds of legumes are increasingly being used to prepare inexpensive protein-rich   (   ). The protein content of animal organs is usually much higher than that of the blood  . Muscles, for example, contain about 30 percent protein, the liver 20 to 30 percent, and   30 percent. Higher percentages of protein are found in hair, bones, and other organs and tissues with a low   content. The quantity of free amino acids and   in animals is much smaller than the amount of protein; protein molecules are produced in   by the stepwise alignment of amino acids and are released into the body fluids only after   is complete. The high protein content of some organs does not mean that the importance of proteins is related to their amount in an organism or  ; on the contrary, some of the most important proteins, such as   and  , occur in extremely small amounts. The importance of proteins is related principally to their function. All enzymes identified thus far are proteins. Enzymes, which are the   of all metabolic reactions, enable an organism to build up the chemical substances necessary for life—proteins,  , carbohydrates, and  —to convert them into other substances, and to degrade them. Life without enzymes is not possible. There are several protein hormones with important regulatory functions. In all vertebrates, the respiratory protein   acts as   carrier in the  , transporting oxygen from the   to body organs and tissues.

For example, it provides materials that are metabolized to supply the   required for the absorption and translocation of  , for the synthesis of   materials, for movement and  , for   of waste products, and for all other activities of the organism. Food also provides materials from which all the structural and   components of the living cell can be assembled. Living organisms differ in the particular substances that they require as food, in the manner in which they synthesize food substances or obtain them from the surrounding  , and in the functions that these substances carry out in their cells.

Other classifications have been used to include various other nutritional patterns. In one scheme, organisms are classified according to the energy source they utilize. Phototrophic, or  , organisms trap   energy and convert it to  , whereas  , or chemosynthetic, organisms utilize inorganic or organic   to supply their energy requirements. If the  -donor materials utilized to form reduced   consist of inorganic compounds, the organism is said to be  ; if organic, the organism is  organotrophic. Combinations of these patterns may also be used to describe organisms. Higher plants, for example, are  photolithotrophic; i.e., they utilize light energy, with the inorganic     serving as the ultimate electron donor. Certain photosynthetic bacteria that cannot utilize water as the electron donor and require organic compounds for this purpose are called  photoorganotrophs. Animals, according to this classification, are  chemoorganotrophs; i.e., they utilize   to supply energy and organic compounds as electron donors. Despite wide variations in the nature of the external energy source utilized by various organisms, all organisms form from their external energy source an immediate source of energy, the chemical compound   (ATP). This energy-rich compound is common to all cells. Through the breaking of its high-energy   bonds and thus by its   to a less energy-rich compound, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), ATP provides the energy for the chemical and mechanical work required by an organism.

The muscle mass continues to increase through the mid-20s, thereafter gradually decreasing.

Throughout adulthood there is a progressive   of cholesterol in the arteries, and the   eventually grows weaker even in the absence of detectable disease. The production of both male and female hormones also diminishes with age, though this cannot be directly related to the gradual diminution in sexual activity that occurs in both males and females between 20 and 60. There is clear evidence that with increasing age adults display a slow, very gradual tendency toward decreasing speed of response in the execution of intellectual (and physical) tasks. Slowing rates of electrical activity in the older adult brain have been linked to the slowing of behaviour itself. This decline in the rate of   processing does not necessarily imply similar changes in learning, memory, or other intellectual functions. The learning   of young adults is superior to that of older adults, as is their ability to organize new information in terms of its content or meaning.

Typical castes in insect societies include the queen, the sexual female responsible for reproduction; the workers, the usually sterile caretakers of the queen and her eggs and larvae; and the soldiers, defenders of the colony (and also sterile). Morphological differences between castes, which enable their members’ performance of different tasks, are sometimes noted; e.g., the pollen basket on the legs of the worker honeybee ( ) does not exist on the queen. In many insect species, differentiation of insect larvae into various castes is determined by diet, although hormonal and environmental factors can also affect development. Some insects also produce worker or soldier subcastes, which are morphologically and functionally distinct. The subcastes of   ants are among the best characterized. These ants are capable of producing minor and major subcastes; minors perform foraging duties, while majors, which have large bodies and heads, are involved primarily in defense. A reduction in the population of minors causes majors to take over their duties, thereby promoting colony survival. Eight species of   ants, all found in the southwestern  , produce a third subcaste, known as super majors (or supersoldiers); this subcaste may allow these species to utilize   food resources (e.g., large seeds) that other   are unable to access.

Unlike most  , mosquitoes in the pupal stage, called tumblers, are active and free-swimming. The   breathe by means of tubes on the thorax. The adults mate soon after emerging from their pupal cases. The duration of the life cycle varies greatly, depending on the species. Mosquitoes are apparently attracted to host animals by moisture,  ,  , body heat, and movement. The mosquito’s hum results from the high frequency of its wingbeats, and the female’s wingbeat frequency may serve as a means of sex recognition. There are three important mosquito   that cause   in humans. , the only known carrier of  , also transmits   and  .   mosquitoes are easily recognized from their resting position, in which the proboscis,  , and body are held in a straight line with one another but at an angle to the surface. The spotted coloring on the wings results from colored scales. Egg laying usually occurs in water containing heavy vegetation. The female deposits her eggs singly on the water surface.   larvae lie parallel to the water surface and breathe through posterior spiracular plates on the   instead of through a tube, as do most other mosquito larvae. The   is from 18 days to several weeks. The     is a carrier of viral encephalitis and, in tropical and subtropical climates, of filariasis. It holds its body parallel to the resting surface and its proboscis is bent downward relative to the surface. The wings, with scales on the veins and the margin, are uniform in color. The tip of the female’s abdomen is blunt and has retracted cerci (sensory appendages). Egg laying may occur on almost any body of fresh water, including standing polluted water. The eggs, which float on the water, are joined in masses of 100 or more. The long and slender   larvae have breathing tubes that contain hair tufts. They hang head downward at an angle of 45° from the water surface. The life cycle, usually 10 to 14 days, may be longer in cold weather. The northern house mosquito ( ) is the most   species in northern regions, while the southern house mosquito ( ) is abundant in southern regions, namely the tropics and subtropics. The genus   carries the pathogens that cause  ,  ,  , and encephalitis. Like  , it holds its body parallel to the resting surface, with the proboscis bent down. The wings are uniformly colored.   may be distinguished from   by its silver thorax with white markings and posterior spiracular bristles. The tip of the female’s abdomen is pointed and has protruding cerci.   usually lays eggs in floodwater, rain pools, or  . The eggs are capable of withstanding long periods of dryness. The short,   larvae have a breathing tube containing a pair of tufts, and the larvae hang head down at a 45° angle from the water surface. The life cycle may be as short as 10 days or, in cool weather, as long as several months. , the important carrier of the   responsible for yellow fever, has white bands on its legs and spots on its abdomen and thorax. This domestic species breeds in almost any kind of container, from   pots to discarded car-tire casings. The eastern salt marsh mosquito ( ), the black salt marsh mosquito ( ), and the summer salt marsh mosquito ( ) are important mosquitoes in coastal marsh areas that experience daily or occasional flooding with brackish or  . They are   breeders, strong fliers, and irritants to animals, including humans. Because mosquitoes are such prolific carriers of infectious diseases, preventing them from feeding on humans is considered to be a key global health strategy. The likelihood of disease transmission can be reduced through the use of mosquito repellent, long clothing that covers the arms and legs, screens in open doors and windows, and insecticide-treated mosquito bed nets. Mosquito populations can be controlled in part through the elimination of sources of standing water, which provide ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes. A surface film of oil can be applied to standing water to clog the breathing tubes of wrigglers, which may also be killed by larvicides.   using larvivorous  , such as the   ( ) is an option for some bodies of water. At times,   are used to destroy adult mosquitoes indoors. Aerial and truck-spraying applications of insecticides are commonly used in urban areas. Such applications are often done in the early evening to reduce the impact on pollinators, and ideally, they consist of insecticides that leave minimal residual effects, though regulations vary widely across the globe. Even in developed countries, commercial yard treatments are often less regulated than municipal applications and are frequently overused by the public. Nontarget   species and many   insects, including  , are often killed with broad or persistent insecticide treatments. Naled, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and other common insecticides used for mosquito control can make their way into waterways and harm aquatic invertebrates, affecting food webs far beyond the application site. Using mosquito insecticides in adverse weather conditions can   their negative environmental impacts. Researchers have investigated the possibility of manipulating mosquito populations to prevent the production of viable mosquito offspring, thereby reducing the number of mosquitoes. Researchers have also identified ways in which male mosquitoes may be   to transmit a gene to their offspring that causes the offspring to die before becoming sexually mature. Scientists have found that female mosquitoes are less attracted to humans when exposed to small   related to the   molecule neuropeptide Y. These compounds could be emitted via dispensers in areas where mosquitoes are abundant, helping to deter them from biting humans.

The heavy-bodied flightless female moth is white with black zigzag markings and has a wingspan of 38 to 50 mm (1.5 to 2 inches). The smaller, darker male is a strong flier. Eggs deposited in   during July are covered with a mass of buff-coloured hair from the female’s abdomen. They hatch the following spring. The flat, pale brown  , with tufts of stiff brown and yellow hairs on their sides, grow to 50 mm and are voracious feeders. They often completely strip trees of their   in several weeks. Unlike most   and  , the larvae are the main dispersal stage. Small larvae spin silk from glands in their mouthparts and hang from branches high up in trees. If the silk lines are long enough, the wind breaks them from the tree, and the silk acts as a  , carrying the young larvae to new, uninfested trees to feed. When larval development is complete, they crawl down the tree trunk, settle in leaf   at the base of the tree, and enter the pupal stage. The adult moth emerges from the   after about 10 days, completing the annual generation. A larger strain, the  Asian spongy moth, has a wingspan of about 90 mm.

Fats are usually solid at ordinary temperatures, such as 25 °C (77 °F), but they begin to liquefy at somewhat higher temperatures. Chemically, fats are identical to animal and   oils, consisting primarily of  , which are esters formed by the reaction of three molecules of fatty acids with one molecule of   (   ). Together with oils, fats   one of the three principal classes of foodstuffs, the others being proteins and carbohydrates. Nearly all cells contain these basic substances. Fat is sometimes called nature’s storehouse of   because on a weight basis it contains more than twice as much energy as does   or  . It is probably as storehouses or depots of concentrated energy that fats appear in   reproductive organs, such as pollen grains and seeds. It is this fat that humans recover from plants for use as   or in industry. The fat content of the nonreproductive tissue of plants is usually so low that recovery is impracticable.   much dietary fat comes from natural foodstuffs without being separated from the other plant materials with which it occurs. The proportion of fat in these foodstuffs varies from 0.1 percent in white potatoes to 70 percent in some nut kernels. More than 90 percent of the fat recovered in the world is obtained from about 20 species of plants and animals. Most of this separated fat is used eventually as human food. Consequently, fat technology deals largely with the separation and processing of fats into forms acceptable to the various dietary customs in the countries in which they are to be used. (For further information on the subject,    .) Humans have used many natural fats for both food and nonfood purposes since prehistoric times. The Egyptians, for example, used   as a lubricant in moving heavy building materials. They also made axle greases from fat and lime, mixed with other materials, as early as 1400  . Homer mentions oil as an aid to  , and Pliny talks about hard and soft soaps. Candles and lamps using oil or   have been used for thousands of years. The commercial uses of fats have increased in number as the understanding of the chemical nature of fats has expanded.  , a Swedish chemist, discovered in 1779 that glycerol could be obtained from olive oil by heating it with litharge (lead monoxide), but it was not until about 1815 that the French chemist   (1786–1889) demonstrated the chemical nature of fats and oils. A few years later the separation of liquid acids from solid acids was accomplished.   was invented by the French chemist  , who in 1869 won a prize offered by   for a satisfactory   substitute. The modern   process had its origin in research in the late 19th century that led to the establishment of the vegetable-oil-shortening industry and a variety of industrial applications. After  , organic chemists gained extensive knowledge first of     and then of glyceride compositions. Growth of the   stimulated a simultaneous expansion of the use of fats as raw materials and as intermediates for scores of new chemicals. The modern application of many organic chemical reactions to fats and fatty acids formed the foundation of a new and rapidly growing fatty-chemicals industry. The universal distribution of fats in plant and animal   suggests physiological roles that go beyond their function as a fuel supply for the cells. In animals the most evident function of fats is that of a food reserve to supply energy (through   enzymatic oxidation—that is, combination with oxygen catalyzed by  ). The storage of fat in vegetable seeds can be explained similarly on the basis that it is a food reserve for the embryo. It is not so easy, however, to account for the presence of large quantities of fat in such fruits as olives, avocados, and palms; much of this fat is probably lost or destroyed before the seed germinates. Fats fulfill other valuable functions in plants and animals. Subcutaneous deposits of fat insulate animals against cold because of the low rate of   in fat, a property especially important for animals living in cold waters or climates—e.g., whales, walruses, and bears. Fats that have been separated from tissues always contain small quantities of closely associated nonglyceride lipids such as phospholipids, sterols, vitamins A, D, and E, and various carotenoid pigments. Many of these substances are vital emulsifying agents or growth factors. Others function as agents that prevent deterioration of fats in plant tissues and seeds caused by destructive combination with oxygen. These minor   probably are present in the fats as a result of their physical solubility, and thus fats serve as carriers for these substances in animal diets. Many animals require some fat containing one or more of the essential fatty acids ( ,  , and to a limited extent  ) to prevent the physical symptoms of essential-fatty-acid deficiency   by skin lesions, scaliness, poor hair growth, and low growth rates. These essential fatty acids must be supplied in the diet since they cannot be synthesized in the body. The  , discovered by the Nobel laureate U.S. von Euler of Sweden, are hormonelike   derived from arachidonic acid. These biologically active fatty acids, which are present in very minute quantities in animal tissues, apparently are involved in contraction of smooth muscles, enzyme activity in    , function of the  , regulation of   and  , function of steroid hormones, fat mobilization in  , and a number of other vital functions.

Adulthood is commonly thought of as beginning at age 20 or 21 years. Middle age, commencing at about 40 years, is followed by old   at about 60 years. A brief treatment of   during adulthood follows. For full treatment,     and  . Physically, early and middle adulthood are marked by slow, gradual declines in body functioning, which accelerate as old age is reached. The muscle mass continues to increase through the mid-20s, thereafter gradually decreasing. The skeletal mass increases until age 30 or so, and then begins to decrease, first in the central skeleton (pelvis and spine) and last in the   skeleton (fingers and toes). Throughout adulthood there is a progressive   of cholesterol in the arteries, and the   eventually grows weaker even in the absence of detectable disease. The production of both male and female hormones also diminishes with age, though this cannot be directly related to the gradual diminution in sexual activity that occurs in both males and females between 20 and 60. There is clear evidence that with increasing age adults display a slow, very gradual tendency toward decreasing speed of response in the execution of intellectual (and physical) tasks. Slowing rates of electrical activity in the older adult brain have been linked to the slowing of behaviour itself. This decline in the rate of   processing does not necessarily imply similar changes in learning, memory, or other intellectual functions. The learning   of young adults is superior to that of older adults, as is their ability to organize new information in terms of its content or meaning. Older adults, on the other hand, are equal or superior to young adults in their capacity to retain general information and in their accumulated cultural knowledge.    ;  .

Mosquitoes are known to   serious diseases, including  ,  ,  ,  , and  .   . The slender elongated body of the adult is covered with scales, as are the veins of the wings. Mosquitoes are also characterized by long fragile-looking legs and elongated piercing mouthparts. The feathery antennae of the male are generally bushier than those of the female. The males, and sometimes the females, feed on   and other   juices and are known pollinators. In most species, however, the females require the   obtained from a   meal in order to mature their eggs. Different species of mosquitoes show preferences and, in many cases, narrow restrictions as to host animals. ( ) The eggs are laid on the surface of water and   into aquatic  , or wrigglers, which swim with a jerking, wriggling movement. In most species, larvae feed on   and organic debris, although a few are predatory and may even feed on other mosquitoes. Unlike most  , mosquitoes in the pupal stage, called tumblers, are active and free-swimming. The   breathe by means of tubes on the thorax. The adults mate soon after emerging from their pupal cases. The duration of the life cycle varies greatly, depending on the species. Mosquitoes are apparently attracted to host animals by moisture,  ,  , body heat, and movement. The mosquito’s hum results from the high frequency of its wingbeats, and the female’s wingbeat frequency may serve as a means of sex recognition. There are three important mosquito   that cause   in humans. , the only known carrier of  , also transmits   and  .   mosquitoes are easily recognized from their resting position, in which the proboscis,  , and body are held in a straight line with one another but at an angle to the surface. The spotted coloring on the wings results from colored scales. Egg laying usually occurs in water containing heavy vegetation. The female deposits her eggs singly on the water surface.   larvae lie parallel to the water surface and breathe through posterior spiracular plates on the   instead of through a tube, as do most other mosquito larvae. The   is from 18 days to several weeks. The     is a carrier of viral encephalitis and, in tropical and subtropical climates, of filariasis. It holds its body parallel to the resting surface and its proboscis is bent downward relative to the surface. The wings, with scales on the veins and the margin, are uniform in color. The tip of the female’s abdomen is blunt and has retracted cerci (sensory appendages). Egg laying may occur on almost any body of fresh water, including standing polluted water. The eggs, which float on the water, are joined in masses of 100 or more. The long and slender   larvae have breathing tubes that contain hair tufts. They hang head downward at an angle of 45° from the water surface. The life cycle, usually 10 to 14 days, may be longer in cold weather. The northern house mosquito ( ) is the most   species in northern regions, while the southern house mosquito ( ) is abundant in southern regions, namely the tropics and subtropics. The genus   carries the pathogens that cause  ,  ,  , and encephalitis. Like  , it holds its body parallel to the resting surface, with the proboscis bent down. The wings are uniformly colored.   may be distinguished from   by its silver thorax with white markings and posterior spiracular bristles. The tip of the female’s abdomen is pointed and has protruding cerci.   usually lays eggs in floodwater, rain pools, or  . The eggs are capable of withstanding long periods of dryness. The short,   larvae have a breathing tube containing a pair of tufts, and the larvae hang head down at a 45° angle from the water surface. The life cycle may be as short as 10 days or, in cool weather, as long as several months. , the important carrier of the   responsible for yellow fever, has white bands on its legs and spots on its abdomen and thorax. This domestic species breeds in almost any kind of container, from   pots to discarded car-tire casings. The eastern salt marsh mosquito ( ), the black salt marsh mosquito ( ), and the summer salt marsh mosquito ( ) are important mosquitoes in coastal marsh areas that experience daily or occasional flooding with brackish or  . They are   breeders, strong fliers, and irritants to animals, including humans. Because mosquitoes are such prolific carriers of infectious diseases, preventing them from feeding on humans is considered to be a key global health strategy. The likelihood of disease transmission can be reduced through the use of mosquito repellent, long clothing that covers the arms and legs, screens in open doors and windows, and insecticide-treated mosquito bed nets. Mosquito populations can be controlled in part through the elimination of sources of standing water, which provide ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes. A surface film of oil can be applied to standing water to clog the breathing tubes of wrigglers, which may also be killed by larvicides.   using larvivorous  , such as the   ( ) is an option for some bodies of water. At times,   are used to destroy adult mosquitoes indoors. Aerial and truck-spraying applications of insecticides are commonly used in urban areas. Such applications are often done in the early evening to reduce the impact on pollinators, and ideally, they consist of insecticides that leave minimal residual effects, though regulations vary widely across the globe. Even in developed countries, commercial yard treatments are often less regulated than municipal applications and are frequently overused by the public. Nontarget   species and many   insects, including  , are often killed with broad or persistent insecticide treatments. Naled, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and other common insecticides used for mosquito control can make their way into waterways and harm aquatic invertebrates, affecting food webs far beyond the application site. Using mosquito insecticides in adverse weather conditions can   their negative environmental impacts. Researchers have investigated the possibility of manipulating mosquito populations to prevent the production of viable mosquito offspring, thereby reducing the number of mosquitoes. Researchers have also identified ways in which male mosquitoes may be   to transmit a gene to their offspring that causes the offspring to die before becoming sexually mature. Scientists have found that female mosquitoes are less attracted to humans when exposed to small   related to the   molecule neuropeptide Y. These compounds could be emitted via dispensers in areas where mosquitoes are abundant, helping to deter them from biting humans.

In lower vertebrates the brain is tubular and resembles an early developmental stage of the brain in higher vertebrates. It consists of three distinct regions: the  , the  , and the  . Although the brain of higher vertebrates undergoes considerable modification during embryonic development, these three regions are still discernible. The hindbrain is composed of the   and the  . The medulla transmits signals between the   and the higher parts of the brain; it also controls such autonomic functions as heartbeat and respiration. The pons is partly made up of tracts connecting the spinal cord with higher brain levels, and it also contains cell groups that transfer information from the cerebrum to the cerebellum. The midbrain, the upper portion of which evolved from the optic lobes, is the main centre of sensory   in   and  . It also is involved with integration in   and  .

The  , originally functioning as part of the olfactory lobes, is involved with the more complex functions of the human brain. In humans and other advanced vertebrates, the cerebrum has grown over the rest of the brain, forming a   (wrinkled) layer of  . The degree of convolution is partly dependent on the size of the body. Small mammals (e.g., lesser  ,  ) generally have smooth brains, and large mammals (e.g.,  ,  ,  ) generally have highly convoluted ones. The   are separated by a deep groove, the longitudinal cerebral  . At the base of this fissure lies a thick bundle of nerve fibres, called the  , which provides a communication link between the hemispheres. The left hemisphere controls the right half of the body, and vice versa, because of a crossing of the nerve fibres in the medulla or, less commonly, in the spinal cord. Although the right and left hemispheres are mirror images of one another in many ways, there are important functional distinctions. In most people, for example, the areas that control speech are located in the left hemisphere, while areas that control   perceptions are located in the right hemisphere. Two major furrows—the   and the lateral sulcus—divide each cerebral hemisphere into four sections: the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The central sulcus, also known as the fissure of Rolando, also separates the cortical motor area (which is anterior to the fissure) from the cortical sensory area (which is posterior to the fissure). Starting from the top of the hemisphere, the upper regions of the motor and sensory areas control the lower parts of the body, and the lower regions of the motor and sensory areas control the upper parts of the body. Other functional areas of the cerebral hemispheres have been identified, including the visual cortex in the occipital lobe and the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. A large amount of the   cortex, however, is devoted to no specific motor or sensory function; this so-called association cortex is apparently involved in higher mental activities.

Nymphs are devoured in turn by many carnivorous  , especially  . Winged mayflies have large   eyes, short, bristlelike antennae, and functionless mouthparts and digestive tracts.

The adult mayfly has two or three threadlike tails, usually as long as, or longer than, the body.  characters include a single claw terminating each of the six legs. The surface of the thoracic region of the body is strongly rounded outward and bears the developing wings in external pads on the upper surface. The abdominal region is usually long and slender. Gills are attached to the outer edge of the upper surface of some of the ten segments into which the body is divided. The body of the nymph terminates in three, less often two, slender tails. Adult mayflies of North American   in body length,   of tails, from 2.5 mm (0.1 inch) for   to 32 mm (more than an inch) for  . Worldwide, about 2,500 species of mayflies have been described, about 700 of them from   north of Mexico. The order is represented on all continents except Antarctica. In areas of high biological productivity (e.g., gravel-bottomed, hard-water, temperate-zone streams), as many as 1,400 nymphs have been found in one square foot of surface, and one gravel riffle has yielded as many as 33 species. The life cycle of mayflies consists of four stages: egg, nymph, subimago, and imago. Eggs, which vary widely in size and surface detail, may be oblong, oval, or rounded. Depending on the species, a female may produce fewer than 50 or more than 10,000 eggs. Eggs are laid in water and either settle to the bottom or adhere to some submerged object. They often hatch in about two weeks but may, under certain circumstances, undergo a period of varying duration in which no growth occurs. This cessation of growth, known as  , is a highly effective   that enables the insects to avoid environmental conditions hostile to developing nymphs or to emerging winged stages. Nymphal life may be as short as two weeks or as long as two years, although an annual cycle is most common. As many as 50   (periodic   of skin) may occur, depending on the species and the  . When growth is complete, the nymphal skin splits down the back and a winged form, called the  , or dun, emerges. The subimago flies from the surface of the water to some sheltered resting place nearby. After an interval lasting a few minutes to several days, but usually overnight, the skin is shed for the last time, and the  , or adult stage (sometimes called a spinner), emerges. Mayflies are the only insects that molt after developing functional wings. The subimago resembles the imago in overall appearance, although it is softer and duller in colour than the adult. The wings of the subimago, generally rather  , are tinted with gray, blue, yellow, or olive. Heavy pigmentation along the veins may give the wings of the subimago a mottled appearance that rarely persists in the imago. Legs and tails of the subimago are shorter than are those of the imago. It is often incorrectly assumed that the two stages are different species. Mating takes place soon after the final molt. In most species death ensues shortly after mating and   (egg deposition). Winged existence may last only a few hours, although   males may live long enough to engage in mating flights on two successive days, and female imagos that retain their eggs may live long enough to mate on either of two successive days. Groups of male imagoes perform a mating flight, or dance, over water as dusk approaches, flying into any breeze or air current. Individuals may   up and forward, then float downward and repeat the performance. Females soon join the  , rising and falling as the dance continues. The male approaches the female from below and behind and grasps her thorax with his elongated front legs. Mating is completed on the wing. After her release by the male, the female deposits her eggs and dies. A few species are ovoviviparous—i.e., eggs hatch within the body of the female generally as she floats, dying, on the surface of a stream or pond. Methods of oviposition vary. Some species drop the rounded egg mass from a height of several feet in a manoeuvre suggestive of dive-bombing, whereas in others, the female flies low over the water’s surface, striking it at intervals with the tip of her abdomen and washing off a few eggs each time she strikes the water. Still other females extrude the eggs from two oviducts as two long packets, which usually adhere to each other. They may be dropped from a foot or more above the water, but more often, the female falls to the surface with wings extended and squeezes out the eggs as she dies. In a fourth type of oviposition, the female alights on some object protruding from the water and crawls under the surface, depositing the eggs while submerged. Females, unless they drop the eggs from a height of several feet, are   to feeding fishes. Mayflies sometimes mistake blacktopped roads for streams, forming swarms over them, and drop eggs on road surfaces. Mayfly nymphs are preyed upon by carnivorous   and fishes. Winged stages are devoured in flight by  ,  , and predatory insects, including  ,  , and hornets. When at rest, mayflies may be preyed upon by  , beetles, birds, and certain  , especially   in North America. During their transformation to the adult stage and especially during oviposition by females, mayflies are vulnerable to   by fishes; artificial lures used by fishermen are patterned after them.

Fats are usually solid at ordinary temperatures, such as 25 °C (77 °F), but they begin to liquefy at somewhat higher temperatures. Chemically, fats are identical to animal and   oils, consisting primarily of  , which are esters formed by the reaction of three molecules of fatty acids with one molecule of   (   ). Together with oils, fats   one of the three principal classes of foodstuffs, the others being proteins and carbohydrates. Nearly all cells contain these basic substances. Fat is sometimes called nature’s storehouse of   because on a weight basis it contains more than twice as much energy as does   or  . It is probably as storehouses or depots of concentrated energy that fats appear in   reproductive organs, such as pollen grains and seeds. It is this fat that humans recover from plants for use as   or in industry. The fat content of the nonreproductive tissue of plants is usually so low that recovery is impracticable.   much dietary fat comes from natural foodstuffs without being separated from the other plant materials with which it occurs. The proportion of fat in these foodstuffs varies from 0.1 percent in white potatoes to 70 percent in some nut kernels. More than 90 percent of the fat recovered in the world is obtained from about 20 species of plants and animals. Most of this separated fat is used eventually as human food. Consequently, fat technology deals largely with the separation and processing of fats into forms acceptable to the various dietary customs in the countries in which they are to be used. (For further information on the subject,    .) Humans have used many natural fats for both food and nonfood purposes since prehistoric times. The Egyptians, for example, used   as a lubricant in moving heavy building materials. They also made axle greases from fat and lime, mixed with other materials, as early as 1400  . Homer mentions oil as an aid to  , and Pliny talks about hard and soft soaps. Candles and lamps using oil or   have been used for thousands of years. The commercial uses of fats have increased in number as the understanding of the chemical nature of fats has expanded.  , a Swedish chemist, discovered in 1779 that glycerol could be obtained from olive oil by heating it with litharge (lead monoxide), but it was not until about 1815 that the French chemist   (1786–1889) demonstrated the chemical nature of fats and oils. A few years later the separation of liquid acids from solid acids was accomplished.   was invented by the French chemist  , who in 1869 won a prize offered by   for a satisfactory   substitute. The modern   process had its origin in research in the late 19th century that led to the establishment of the vegetable-oil-shortening industry and a variety of industrial applications. After  , organic chemists gained extensive knowledge first of     and then of glyceride compositions. Growth of the   stimulated a simultaneous expansion of the use of fats as raw materials and as intermediates for scores of new chemicals. The modern application of many organic chemical reactions to fats and fatty acids formed the foundation of a new and rapidly growing fatty-chemicals industry. The universal distribution of fats in plant and animal   suggests physiological roles that go beyond their function as a fuel supply for the cells. In animals the most evident function of fats is that of a food reserve to supply energy (through   enzymatic oxidation—that is, combination with oxygen catalyzed by  ). The storage of fat in vegetable seeds can be explained similarly on the basis that it is a food reserve for the embryo. It is not so easy, however, to account for the presence of large quantities of fat in such fruits as olives, avocados, and palms; much of this fat is probably lost or destroyed before the seed germinates. Fats fulfill other valuable functions in plants and animals. Subcutaneous deposits of fat insulate animals against cold because of the low rate of   in fat, a property especially important for animals living in cold waters or climates—e.g., whales, walruses, and bears. Fats that have been separated from tissues always contain small quantities of closely associated nonglyceride lipids such as phospholipids, sterols, vitamins A, D, and E, and various carotenoid pigments. Many of these substances are vital emulsifying agents or growth factors. Others function as agents that prevent deterioration of fats in plant tissues and seeds caused by destructive combination with oxygen. These minor   probably are present in the fats as a result of their physical solubility, and thus fats serve as carriers for these substances in animal diets. Many animals require some fat containing one or more of the essential fatty acids ( ,  , and to a limited extent  ) to prevent the physical symptoms of essential-fatty-acid deficiency   by skin lesions, scaliness, poor hair growth, and low growth rates. These essential fatty acids must be supplied in the diet since they cannot be synthesized in the body. The  , discovered by the Nobel laureate U.S. von Euler of Sweden, are hormonelike   derived from arachidonic acid. These biologically active fatty acids, which are present in very minute quantities in animal tissues, apparently are involved in contraction of smooth muscles, enzyme activity in    , function of the  , regulation of   and  , function of steroid hormones, fat mobilization in  , and a number of other vital functions.

In all organisms the essence of fertilization is, in fact, the fusion of the   material of two different    , or  , each of which carries half the number of   typical of the  . The most   form of fertilization, found in microorganisms and protozoans, consists of an exchange of genetic material between two cells. The first significant event in fertilization is the fusion of the   of the two gametes, resulting in the formation of a channel that allows the passage of material from one   to the other. Fertilization in advanced   is preceded by  , during which   is transferred to, and establishes contact with, the female   or macrospore. Fusion in advanced   is usually followed by penetration of the egg by a single spermatozoon. The result of fertilization is a cell ( ) capable of undergoing cell division to form a new individual. The fusion of two gametes initiates several reactions in the egg. One of these causes a change in the egg membrane(s), so that the attachment of and penetration by more than one spermatozoon cannot occur. In species in which more than one spermatozoon normally enters an egg ( ), only one spermatozoal nucleus actually merges with the egg nucleus. The most important result of fertilization is egg activation, which allows the egg to undergo  . Activation, however, does not necessarily require the intervention of a spermatozoon; during  , in which fertilization does not occur, activation of an egg may be accomplished through the intervention of physical and chemical agents.   such as  ,  , and   normally reproduce by parthenogenesis. In plants, certain chemicals produced by the egg may attract spermatozoa. In animals, with the possible exception of some   (coelenterates), it appears likely that contact between eggs and spermatozoa depends on random  . On the other hand, the gelatinous coats that surround the eggs of many animals exert a trapping action on spermatozoa, thus increasing the chances for successful sperm-egg interaction. The eggs of marine invertebrates, especially  , are classical objects for the study of fertilization. These transparent eggs are valuable for studies observing living cells and for biochemical and molecular investigations because the time of fertilization can be accurately fixed, the   of many eggs occurs at about the same rate under suitable conditions, and large quantities of the eggs are obtainable. The eggs of some   and   also have been used with favourable results. Maturation is the final step in the production of functional eggs ( ) that can associate with a spermatozoon and develop a reaction that prevents the entry of more than one spermatozoon. In addition, the   of a mature egg can support the changes that lead to fusion of spermatozoal and egg nuclei and initiate embryonic development. Certain components of an egg’s surface, especially the  cortical granules, are associated with a mature condition. Cortical granules of sea urchin eggs, aligned beneath the   membrane (thin, soft, pliable layer) of mature eggs, have a diameter of 0.8–1.0 micron (0.0008–0.001 millimetre) and are surrounded by a membrane similar in structure to the   surrounding the egg. Cortical granules are formed in a cell component known as a  , from which they migrate to the surface of the maturing egg. The surface of a   egg has the ability to affect the passage of light unequally in different directions; this property, called  , is an indication that the molecules   the surface layers are arranged in a definite way. Since birefringence appears as an egg matures, it is likely that the properties of a mature egg membrane are associated with specific molecular arrangements. A mature egg is able to support the formation of a zygote nucleus; i.e., the result of fusion of spermatozoal and egg nuclei. In most eggs the process of reduction of chromosomal number ( ) is not completed prior to fertilization. In such cases the fertilizing spermatozoon remains beneath the egg surface until meiosis in the egg has been completed, after which changes and movements that lead to fusion and the formation of a zygote occur. The surfaces of most animal eggs are surrounded by envelopes, which may be soft gelatinous coats (as in echinoderms and some amphibians) or thick membranes (as in  ,  , and mammals). In order to reach the egg surface, therefore, spermatozoa must penetrate these envelopes; indeed, spermatozoa contain   (organic catalysts) that break them down. In some cases (e.g., fishes and insects) there is a channel, or micropyle, in the envelope, through which a spermatozoon can reach the egg. The jelly coats of echinoderm and   eggs consist of complex   called sulfated mucopolysaccharides. The envelope of a mammalian egg is more complex. The egg is surrounded by a thick coat composed of a carbohydrate protein complex called  . The zona is surrounded by an outer envelope, the  corona radiata, which is many cell layers thick and formed by follicle cells adhering to the oocyte before it leaves the ovarian follicle. Although it once was postulated that the jelly coat of an echinoderm egg contains a substance ( ) thought to have an important role not only in the establishment of sperm-egg interaction but also in egg activation, fertilizin now has been shown identical with jelly-coat material, rather than a substance continuously   from it. Yet there is evidence that the egg envelopes do play a role in fertilization; i.e., contact with the egg coat elicits the acrosome reaction (described below) in spermatozoa.

This biological species concept is widely used in biology and related fields of study. There are more than 20 other different species concepts, however. Some examples include the ecological species concept, which describes a species as a group of organisms framed by the resources they depend on (in other words, their  ), and the genetic species concept, which considers all organisms capable of inheriting   from one another within a common   and the amount of genetic difference between   of that species. Like the biological species concept, the genetic species concept considers which individuals are capable of interbreeding, as well as the amount of genetic difference between populations of that species, but it may also be used to estimate when the species originated. The   of species originates in  , where the species is the fundamental unit of classification recognized by the International Commission of Zoological  . Every species is assigned a standard two-part name of   and species. The genus is the generic name that includes closely related species; the gray  , for example, is classified as   and is a close relative of the   found in   and designated as  , their systematic relation indicated by their sharing the same genus name,  . Similarly, genera that have shared   (or traits) are classified in the same taxonomic family; related families are placed in the same order; related orders are placed in the same class; and related classes are placed in the same phylum. This classification system is a   applied to all animals and plants, as originally set forth by the Swedish naturalist   in the 18th century. Organisms are grouped into species partly according to their  , or external, similarities, but more important in classifying sexually reproducing organisms is the organisms’ ability to successfully interbreed. Individuals of a single species can mate and produce viable offspring with one another but almost never with members of other species. Separate species have been known to produce hybrid offspring (for example, the   and the   producing the  ), but, because the   are almost always inviable or sterile, the interbreeding is not considered successful. Interbreeding only within the species is of great importance for evolution in that individuals of one species share a common     that members of other species do not. Within a single pool there is always a certain amount of   among individuals, and those whose genetic variations leave them at a disadvantage in a particular   tend to be eliminated in favour of those with advantageous variations. This process of   results in the gene pool’s evolving in such a way that the advantageous variations become the norm.

Hormones called   and juvenile hormones, which are not species specific, apparently regulate the changes. These physical changes as well as those involving growth and differentiation are accompanied by alterations of the organism’s physiology, biochemistry, and behaviour. The immature forms, or larvae, are adapted to   and modes of life that differ from those of the   forms. These differences may be of significance in assuring that larvae and adults of the same species do not engage in direct competition for food or living space. Examples of   include the tadpole, an aquatic larval stage that transforms into the land-dwelling frog (class Amphibia). Starfishes and other echinoderms undergo a metamorphosis that includes a change from the bilateral symmetry of the larva to the radial symmetry of the adult. Metamorphic patterns are well-known in crabs, lobsters, and other crustaceans and also in snails, clams, and other mollusks. The larval form of the   (  the tunicate, or sea squirt) is tadpole-like and free swimming; the adult is sessile and somewhat degenerate. Among the most dramatic and thoroughly studied examples of metamorphosis are the  . Because development is not the same in all insects, it is convenient to group them into major categories according to the pattern of structural changes:  , hemimetabolous, and holometabolous. In ametabolous development there is simply a gradual increase in the size of young until adult dimensions are attained. This kind of development occurs in the  , springtail, and other primitive insects. In more advanced insects (  grasshoppers, termites, true bugs) a phenomenon known as gradual, or  , metamorphosis occurs. The hemimetabolous life cycle consists of egg,  , and adult. The nymph, or immature  , resembles the adult in form and eating habits, differing in size, body proportions, and colour pattern.   wings are visible and develop externally. Development is gradual through a series of molts (periodic shedding of the outer skeleton), the adult emerging from the final molt. Complete, or  , metamorphosis is characteristic of beetles, butterflies and moths, flies, and wasps. Their life cycle includes four stages: egg,   ( ),   ( ), and adult. The larva differs greatly from the adult. It is wingless, and its form and habits are suited for growth and development rather than reproduction. The change to the adult occurs during the inactive, nonfeeding pupal stage. At this time the larva undergoes a   in which the wings appear externally, larval organs and tissues are broken down, and adult structures are developed.  , a form of complete metamorphosis, occurs in some beetles, flies, and other insects and is characterized by a series of larval stages.

Hormones carry out their functions by evoking responses from specific   or   that are adapted to react to minute quantities of them. The classical view of hormones is that they are transmitted to their targets in the bloodstream after discharge from the glands that secrete them. This mode of discharge (directly into the bloodstream) is called    .

Hormonal regulation is closely related to that exerted by the  , and the two processes have generally been distinguished by the rate at which each causes effects, the duration of these effects, and their extent; i.e., the effects of endocrine regulation may be slow to develop but prolonged in influence and widely distributed through the body, whereas nervous regulation is typically concerned with quick responses that are of brief duration and localized in their effects. Advances in knowledge, however, have modified these distinctions.  are secretory, for responses to the nerve impulses that they   depend upon the production of   substances, or  , such as   and   (noradrenaline), which are liberated at nerve endings in minute amounts and have only a momentary action. It has been established, however, that certain specialized nerve cells, called  , can translate neural signals into chemical stimuli by producing secretions called  . These secretions, which are often polypeptides (compounds similar to   but composed of fewer  ), pass along nerve-cell extensions, or axons, and are typically released into the bloodstream at special regions called  , where the   endings are in close contact with blood  . Once released in this way, neurohormones function in principle similar to hormones that are   in the bloodstream and are synthesized in the endocrine glands. The distinctions between neural and endocrine regulation, no longer as clear-cut as they once seemed to be, are further weakened by the fact that neurosecretory nerve endings are sometimes so close to their target cells that vascular transmission is not necessary. There is good evidence that hormonal regulation occurs by diffusion in plants and (although here the evidence is largely indirect) in lower animals (e.g., coelenterates), which lack a  . Hormones have a long evolutionary history, knowledge of which is important if their properties and functions are to be understood. Many important features of the    , for example, are present in the lampreys and hagfishes, modern representatives of the primitively jawless vertebrates ( ), and these features were presumably present in   ancestors that lived more than 500 million years ago. The evolution of the endocrine system in the more advanced vertebrates with jaws ( ) has involved both the appearance of new hormones and the further evolution of some of those already present in agnathans; in addition, extensive specialization of target organs has occurred to permit new patterns of response. The factors involved in the first appearance of the various hormones is largely a matter for conjecture, although hormones clearly are only one mechanism for chemical regulation,   forms of which are found in living things at all stages of development. Other mechanisms for chemical regulation include chemical substances (so-called organizer substances) that regulate early embryonic development and the pheromones that are released by social insects as sex attractants and regulators of the social organization. Perhaps, in some instances, chemical regulators including hormones appeared first as metabolic by-products. A few such substances are known in physiological regulation:  , for example, is involved in the regulation of the respiratory activity of which it is a product, in insects as well as in vertebrates. Substances such as carbon dioxide are called  parahormones to distinguish them from true hormones, which are specialized secretions.

Morphological differences between castes, which enable their members’ performance of different tasks, are sometimes noted; e.g., the pollen basket on the legs of the worker honeybee ( ) does not exist on the queen.

These ants are capable of producing minor and major subcastes; minors perform foraging duties, while majors, which have large bodies and heads, are involved primarily in defense. A reduction in the population of minors causes majors to take over their duties, thereby promoting colony survival. Eight species of   ants, all found in the southwestern  , produce a third subcaste, known as super majors (or supersoldiers); this subcaste may allow these species to utilize   food resources (e.g., large seeds) that other   are unable to access.

Other common names for the winged stages are shadfly, sandfly, dayfly, fishfly, and drake. The aquatic immature stage, called a   or naiad, is widely distributed in freshwater, although a few species can tolerate the brackish water of marine  . The winged stages attract attention through mass emergences when they may make roads slippery, clog gutters, and taint the air with an odour of decay. Mayfly nymphs are important in the   cycle that occurs in freshwaters. Some species are carnivorous, but the majority of nymphs feed on  ,  , higher  , and organic  . Nymphs are devoured in turn by many carnivorous  , especially  . Winged mayflies have large   eyes, short, bristlelike antennae, and functionless mouthparts and digestive tracts. Once mayflies enter the winged stages they cannot feed. Their membranous wings include a large, triangular front pair and a much smaller, rounded hind pair. In a few species, the hind pair is extremely reduced or absent. In repose, the wings are held together upright over the body like those of a  . The adult mayfly has two or three threadlike tails, usually as long as, or longer than, the body.  characters include a single claw terminating each of the six legs. The surface of the thoracic region of the body is strongly rounded outward and bears the developing wings in external pads on the upper surface. The abdominal region is usually long and slender. Gills are attached to the outer edge of the upper surface of some of the ten segments into which the body is divided. The body of the nymph terminates in three, less often two, slender tails. Adult mayflies of North American   in body length,   of tails, from 2.5 mm (0.1 inch) for   to 32 mm (more than an inch) for  . Worldwide, about 2,500 species of mayflies have been described, about 700 of them from   north of Mexico. The order is represented on all continents except Antarctica. In areas of high biological productivity (e.g., gravel-bottomed, hard-water, temperate-zone streams), as many as 1,400 nymphs have been found in one square foot of surface, and one gravel riffle has yielded as many as 33 species. The life cycle of mayflies consists of four stages: egg, nymph, subimago, and imago. Eggs, which vary widely in size and surface detail, may be oblong, oval, or rounded. Depending on the species, a female may produce fewer than 50 or more than 10,000 eggs. Eggs are laid in water and either settle to the bottom or adhere to some submerged object. They often hatch in about two weeks but may, under certain circumstances, undergo a period of varying duration in which no growth occurs. This cessation of growth, known as  , is a highly effective   that enables the insects to avoid environmental conditions hostile to developing nymphs or to emerging winged stages. Nymphal life may be as short as two weeks or as long as two years, although an annual cycle is most common. As many as 50   (periodic   of skin) may occur, depending on the species and the  . When growth is complete, the nymphal skin splits down the back and a winged form, called the  , or dun, emerges. The subimago flies from the surface of the water to some sheltered resting place nearby. After an interval lasting a few minutes to several days, but usually overnight, the skin is shed for the last time, and the  , or adult stage (sometimes called a spinner), emerges. Mayflies are the only insects that molt after developing functional wings. The subimago resembles the imago in overall appearance, although it is softer and duller in colour than the adult. The wings of the subimago, generally rather  , are tinted with gray, blue, yellow, or olive. Heavy pigmentation along the veins may give the wings of the subimago a mottled appearance that rarely persists in the imago. Legs and tails of the subimago are shorter than are those of the imago. It is often incorrectly assumed that the two stages are different species. Mating takes place soon after the final molt. In most species death ensues shortly after mating and   (egg deposition). Winged existence may last only a few hours, although   males may live long enough to engage in mating flights on two successive days, and female imagos that retain their eggs may live long enough to mate on either of two successive days. Groups of male imagoes perform a mating flight, or dance, over water as dusk approaches, flying into any breeze or air current. Individuals may   up and forward, then float downward and repeat the performance. Females soon join the  , rising and falling as the dance continues. The male approaches the female from below and behind and grasps her thorax with his elongated front legs. Mating is completed on the wing. After her release by the male, the female deposits her eggs and dies. A few species are ovoviviparous—i.e., eggs hatch within the body of the female generally as she floats, dying, on the surface of a stream or pond. Methods of oviposition vary. Some species drop the rounded egg mass from a height of several feet in a manoeuvre suggestive of dive-bombing, whereas in others, the female flies low over the water’s surface, striking it at intervals with the tip of her abdomen and washing off a few eggs each time she strikes the water. Still other females extrude the eggs from two oviducts as two long packets, which usually adhere to each other. They may be dropped from a foot or more above the water, but more often, the female falls to the surface with wings extended and squeezes out the eggs as she dies. In a fourth type of oviposition, the female alights on some object protruding from the water and crawls under the surface, depositing the eggs while submerged. Females, unless they drop the eggs from a height of several feet, are   to feeding fishes. Mayflies sometimes mistake blacktopped roads for streams, forming swarms over them, and drop eggs on road surfaces. Mayfly nymphs are preyed upon by carnivorous   and fishes. Winged stages are devoured in flight by  ,  , and predatory insects, including  ,  , and hornets. When at rest, mayflies may be preyed upon by  , beetles, birds, and certain  , especially   in North America. During their transformation to the adult stage and especially during oviposition by females, mayflies are vulnerable to   by fishes; artificial lures used by fishermen are patterned after them.

Content: There’s another food revolution coming. And it isn’t a quiet one. It’s practically buzzing. And clicking. And crunching. It’s almost orchestral, really, in a tinny, droning sort of way. That’s right: an increasing number of scientists suggest that if we’re to support our booming population in the coming decades, we must turn to new sources of protein, namely, in the form of insects. If the leaps in grain production in the late 1960s—attributable to genetic engineering and improved agricultural techniques—constituted a Green Revolution, this is a protein revolution. It’s not going to go down easy, not in the Western world at least. Though residents of equatorial countries have long availed themselves of the protein-rich flesh of insects, Westerners usually still find their gorges rising at the thought of ingesting a single bug, let alone a risotto studded with them. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) wants to find ways around this squeamishness. In doing so, it turned to a cadre of entomologists, food scientists, and other experts, who issued a report on the subject in 2013. Notably, the report emphasized that raising insects for food uses substantially fewer resources than raising large vertebrate livestock. The lead author, entomologist Arnold van Huis, says, “Crickets, grasshoppers and locusts are my favorites, in particular when they are nicely cooked and seasoned. Deep-fried, they can also become nicely crunchy.” What is the name for an insect’s egg-laying organ? How many known species of insects are there? You may...

In lower vertebrates the brain is tubular and resembles an early developmental stage of the brain in higher vertebrates. It consists of three distinct regions: the  , the  , and the  . Although the brain of higher vertebrates undergoes considerable modification during embryonic development, these three regions are still discernible. The hindbrain is composed of the   and the  . The medulla transmits signals between the   and the higher parts of the brain; it also controls such autonomic functions as heartbeat and respiration. The pons is partly made up of tracts connecting the spinal cord with higher brain levels, and it also contains cell groups that transfer information from the cerebrum to the cerebellum. The midbrain, the upper portion of which evolved from the optic lobes, is the main centre of sensory   in   and  . It also is involved with integration in   and  .

The hypothalamus produces hormones that control the secretions of the anterior  , and it also produces   and  , which are stored in and released by the posterior pituitary gland. The  , originally functioning as part of the olfactory lobes, is involved with the more complex functions of the human brain. In humans and other advanced vertebrates, the cerebrum has grown over the rest of the brain, forming a   (wrinkled) layer of  . The degree of convolution is partly dependent on the size of the body. Small mammals (e.g., lesser  ,  ) generally have smooth brains, and large mammals (e.g.,  ,  ,  ) generally have highly convoluted ones. The   are separated by a deep groove, the longitudinal cerebral  . At the base of this fissure lies a thick bundle of nerve fibres, called the  , which provides a communication link between the hemispheres. The left hemisphere controls the right half of the body, and vice versa, because of a crossing of the nerve fibres in the medulla or, less commonly, in the spinal cord. Although the right and left hemispheres are mirror images of one another in many ways, there are important functional distinctions. In most people, for example, the areas that control speech are located in the left hemisphere, while areas that control   perceptions are located in the right hemisphere. Two major furrows—the   and the lateral sulcus—divide each cerebral hemisphere into four sections: the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The central sulcus, also known as the fissure of Rolando, also separates the cortical motor area (which is anterior to the fissure) from the cortical sensory area (which is posterior to the fissure). Starting from the top of the hemisphere, the upper regions of the motor and sensory areas control the lower parts of the body, and the lower regions of the motor and sensory areas control the upper parts of the body. Other functional areas of the cerebral hemispheres have been identified, including the visual cortex in the occipital lobe and the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. A large amount of the   cortex, however, is devoted to no specific motor or sensory function; this so-called association cortex is apparently involved in higher mental activities.

In all organisms the essence of fertilization is, in fact, the fusion of the   material of two different    , or  , each of which carries half the number of   typical of the  . The most   form of fertilization, found in microorganisms and protozoans, consists of an exchange of genetic material between two cells. The first significant event in fertilization is the fusion of the   of the two gametes, resulting in the formation of a channel that allows the passage of material from one   to the other. Fertilization in advanced   is preceded by  , during which   is transferred to, and establishes contact with, the female   or macrospore. Fusion in advanced   is usually followed by penetration of the egg by a single spermatozoon. The result of fertilization is a cell ( ) capable of undergoing cell division to form a new individual. The fusion of two gametes initiates several reactions in the egg. One of these causes a change in the egg membrane(s), so that the attachment of and penetration by more than one spermatozoon cannot occur. In species in which more than one spermatozoon normally enters an egg ( ), only one spermatozoal nucleus actually merges with the egg nucleus. The most important result of fertilization is egg activation, which allows the egg to undergo  . Activation, however, does not necessarily require the intervention of a spermatozoon; during  , in which fertilization does not occur, activation of an egg may be accomplished through the intervention of physical and chemical agents.   such as  ,  , and   normally reproduce by parthenogenesis. In plants, certain chemicals produced by the egg may attract spermatozoa. In animals, with the possible exception of some   (coelenterates), it appears likely that contact between eggs and spermatozoa depends on random  . On the other hand, the gelatinous coats that surround the eggs of many animals exert a trapping action on spermatozoa, thus increasing the chances for successful sperm-egg interaction. The eggs of marine invertebrates, especially  , are classical objects for the study of fertilization. These transparent eggs are valuable for studies observing living cells and for biochemical and molecular investigations because the time of fertilization can be accurately fixed, the   of many eggs occurs at about the same rate under suitable conditions, and large quantities of the eggs are obtainable. The eggs of some   and   also have been used with favourable results. Maturation is the final step in the production of functional eggs ( ) that can associate with a spermatozoon and develop a reaction that prevents the entry of more than one spermatozoon. In addition, the   of a mature egg can support the changes that lead to fusion of spermatozoal and egg nuclei and initiate embryonic development. Certain components of an egg’s surface, especially the  cortical granules, are associated with a mature condition. Cortical granules of sea urchin eggs, aligned beneath the   membrane (thin, soft, pliable layer) of mature eggs, have a diameter of 0.8–1.0 micron (0.0008–0.001 millimetre) and are surrounded by a membrane similar in structure to the   surrounding the egg. Cortical granules are formed in a cell component known as a  , from which they migrate to the surface of the maturing egg. The surface of a   egg has the ability to affect the passage of light unequally in different directions; this property, called  , is an indication that the molecules   the surface layers are arranged in a definite way. Since birefringence appears as an egg matures, it is likely that the properties of a mature egg membrane are associated with specific molecular arrangements. A mature egg is able to support the formation of a zygote nucleus; i.e., the result of fusion of spermatozoal and egg nuclei. In most eggs the process of reduction of chromosomal number ( ) is not completed prior to fertilization. In such cases the fertilizing spermatozoon remains beneath the egg surface until meiosis in the egg has been completed, after which changes and movements that lead to fusion and the formation of a zygote occur. The surfaces of most animal eggs are surrounded by envelopes, which may be soft gelatinous coats (as in echinoderms and some amphibians) or thick membranes (as in  ,  , and mammals). In order to reach the egg surface, therefore, spermatozoa must penetrate these envelopes; indeed, spermatozoa contain   (organic catalysts) that break them down. In some cases (e.g., fishes and insects) there is a channel, or micropyle, in the envelope, through which a spermatozoon can reach the egg. The jelly coats of echinoderm and   eggs consist of complex   called sulfated mucopolysaccharides. The envelope of a mammalian egg is more complex. The egg is surrounded by a thick coat composed of a carbohydrate protein complex called  . The zona is surrounded by an outer envelope, the  corona radiata, which is many cell layers thick and formed by follicle cells adhering to the oocyte before it leaves the ovarian follicle. Although it once was postulated that the jelly coat of an echinoderm egg contains a substance ( ) thought to have an important role not only in the establishment of sperm-egg interaction but also in egg activation, fertilizin now has been shown identical with jelly-coat material, rather than a substance continuously   from it. Yet there is evidence that the egg envelopes do play a role in fertilization; i.e., contact with the egg coat elicits the acrosome reaction (described below) in spermatozoa.

This biological species concept is widely used in biology and related fields of study. There are more than 20 other different species concepts, however. Some examples include the ecological species concept, which describes a species as a group of organisms framed by the resources they depend on (in other words, their  ), and the genetic species concept, which considers all organisms capable of inheriting   from one another within a common   and the amount of genetic difference between   of that species. Like the biological species concept, the genetic species concept considers which individuals are capable of interbreeding, as well as the amount of genetic difference between populations of that species, but it may also be used to estimate when the species originated. The   of species originates in  , where the species is the fundamental unit of classification recognized by the International Commission of Zoological  . Every species is assigned a standard two-part name of   and species. The genus is the generic name that includes closely related species; the gray  , for example, is classified as   and is a close relative of the   found in   and designated as  , their systematic relation indicated by their sharing the same genus name,  . Similarly, genera that have shared   (or traits) are classified in the same taxonomic family; related families are placed in the same order; related orders are placed in the same class; and related classes are placed in the same phylum. This classification system is a   applied to all animals and plants, as originally set forth by the Swedish naturalist   in the 18th century. Organisms are grouped into species partly according to their  , or external, similarities, but more important in classifying sexually reproducing organisms is the organisms’ ability to successfully interbreed. Individuals of a single species can mate and produce viable offspring with one another but almost never with members of other species. Separate species have been known to produce hybrid offspring (for example, the   and the   producing the  ), but, because the   are almost always inviable or sterile, the interbreeding is not considered successful. Interbreeding only within the species is of great importance for evolution in that individuals of one species share a common     that members of other species do not. Within a single pool there is always a certain amount of   among individuals, and those whose genetic variations leave them at a disadvantage in a particular   tend to be eliminated in favour of those with advantageous variations. This process of   results in the gene pool’s evolving in such a way that the advantageous variations become the norm. Because genetic variations originate in individuals of a species and because those individuals pass on their variations only within the species, then it is at the species level that evolution takes place.

Content: Oh no, it’s a bug! There are many different kinds of insects in many different shapes and sizes. Some frighten people, while others delight them. And some play an important role in helping people get healthy. This list will help you gain a greater understanding of bugs.  The Handy Answer Book for Kids (and Parents)   are small creatures with three pairs of legs, a body with three main parts (a head, thorax, and abdomen), and a tough shell-like outer covering, called an exoskeleton. Insects are  , which means they do not have a backbone. Most have one or two pairs of wings and a pair of antennae. There are about 1,000,000 known species of insects in the world, and entomologists (scientists who study bugs) estimate that there are millions (perhaps up to 10 million!) more yet to be discovered. Insects are everywhere—there are more bugs in 1 square mile (about 2.6 sq km) of rural land than there are human beings on the entire globe. Insects are divided into 32 orders, or groups. The largest insect order is the beetles ( ) with 200 different families and approximately 400,000 different species. In fact, one out of every four animals on Earth is some type of beetle. In the United States, there are some 73,000 species of insects: approximately 24,000 beetles, 19,500  , 17,500  ,  , and  , and 11,500   and  .  grow through the process of  , meaning that they undergo change. Insect groups that undergo a complete metamorphosis include beetles, moths, butterflies, sawflies, wasps, ants, bees, and flies. All these groups begin their   as an  . The egg hatches into a  —such as a caterpillar, grub, or maggot—that feeds, molts (sheds its skin), and grows larger. The larva goes through an inactive   stage—for example, it is wrapped up in a cocoon—and emerges as an adult insect, such as a butterfly or beetle, that looks very different from the larva it once was.  Other insect groups do not go through a complete metamorphosis; instead, they experience gradual changes as they turn into adults. These include scales, aphids, cicadas, leafhoppers, true bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, praying mantises, cockroaches, earwigs, and dragonflies. Immature forms of these insects are called nymphs. The   grow and gradually change size, shedding their skin along the way. After a final molt, the full adult form emerges.  and other   fly from one plant to the next so as to feed on the sweet  —and sometimes the  —located in the interior of  . The sugar in nectar supplies insects with the energy they need, and pollen contains protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals. In the process of feeding, many insects transfer pollen—which sticks to their bodies—from one plant’s flower to another.  Pollen, which is a fine powdery grain from a flower’s male reproductive organ, must be transferred to the female reproductive organ of a flower for fertilization to take place and seeds to form. Most adult  , including   and  , have two large  , made up of separate lenses. Sometimes these eyes have thousands of lenses. They all point in different directions to give the insect a very wide field of vision. The lenses also help the insect see movement, enabling it to react quickly to seize its prey or escape danger. You can witness this yourself as you try to swat a fly in your home—it’s very difficult to catch a flying insect! The large round spots on the wings of   and  , which look like big round eyes, are a defense mechanism. When a bird or other animal tries to eat the insect, the insect opens its wings and begins to fly off. The wing movement reveals the moth’s “eyes,” confusing the insect’s enemy by  . The predator hesitates, and the insect is able to escape. Yes.   are   that live in colonies, or underground chambers, which may house as many as 500,000 individuals. Ant chambers are connected to each other and to the surface of the earth by small tunnels. There are rooms for food storage, rooms for mating, and nurseries for the young. A queen produces eggs to supply new ants for the colony. The colony is built and maintained by legions of worker ants, who carry tiny bits of dirt in their mandibles (a pair of appendages near the insect’s mouth) and deposit them near the exit of the colony, forming an ant hill.  While most ant colonies are self-sufficient, Amazon ants, which are aggressive red ants (genus  ) found in the western U.S., steal the   of other ants so as to use them as workers—to build homes for and feed the Amazon ants, who do nothing but fight. They depend completely on these “enslaved” ants for survival. That depends on what you mean by the word  . The   often cited as the   is   (also classified as  ), which lives in western  . These insects can be 22 inches (56 cm) long! They are related to the group of insects called walkingsticks.   get their name from the fact that they do, indeed, look like sticks with legs. The largest walkingsticks can grow to up to 13 inches (33 centimeters) in length. There are approximately 3,000 tropical species of walkingsticks, and 10 species that live in North America. One species,  , is the longest insect in the United States, reaching 7 inches (17.7 cm) in length. If you are talking about the   insect, then take a look at the giant weta ( ), an   insect that can weigh up to two and a half ounces (71 g). These insects may look ferocious and scary because of their size, but they are actually harmless. Another insect that is often considered the biggest is the Actaeon beetle ( ) because it is very bulky looking and can be as big as 3.5 inches (9 cm) long by 2 inches (5 cm) wide and 1.5 inches (4 cm) thick. The  , also called a praying mantid, is a large flesh-eating insect that lives in warm areas of the world. Mantis species from Europe and China were introduced to the northeastern United States many decades ago for use as pest exterminators on farms and in gardens. These   insects—sometimes called “vicious predators”—are among the few insects that can rotate their heads to look over their shoulders, making them extremely effective hunters. They pose in a deceptively humble posture when searching for food, as if their front legs are folded in prayer. Mantises grab their victims with their raptorial front legs, which quickly shoot out from their bodies. Mantises almost always start eating their catch while it is alive, and they often start eating their victim’s neck to quickly end the struggle.  Praying mantises eat a variety of insects—other mantises, beetles, butterflies,  ,  —and  . They also eat small  ,  ,  ,  , and other nesting birds. Because they keep down the populations of “bad bugs” that threaten farms, they are highly useful to agricultural workers. Many people think of   as insects, but actually they are classified in a separate category. Spiders are part of a group called  , which also includes  ,  , and  . Arachnids share many features with their arthropod cousins, but they differ in that they do not have antennae. Spiders also have eight legs (insects have six), and spiders’ bodies are segmented into two parts (insects’ bodies have three parts). Both   and   maggots are used occasionally in the field of medicine. The U.S. federal government’s   considers both bugs “approved medical devices,” the first live animals to be called that name.

Content: Ask a summertime picnicker what their biggest annoyance is, and the answer will likely be “bees.” Landing on uncovered food and drink with impunity, these insects aren’t particularly inclined to leave once they’ve tasted the ambrosial offerings that constitute the average picnic. If irate diners press the issue by brandishing paper plates and rolled newspapers, they won’t hesitate to defend their newfound bounty with a sting. Or four. That latter ability is perhaps the most-acute indication that the prime suspects in a typical picnic raid are not bees at all. In all likelihood, the culprits are actually close cousins to the bees: wasps.   (assuming that they aren’t crushed by their outraged victims). Even the most-uninterested observer can distinguish them in ways that don’t involve being pumped full of venom, though. While the bees and wasps constitute some 20,000 species each—both groups belong to the order Hymenoptera, which also contains ants—the insects most likely to be conflated are honeybees ( ) and any of several representatives of the wasp genera   (commonly known as yellow jackets). If you take a look at the insects, you can see what causes the confusion. Both yellow jackets and honeybees are somewhat bullet-shaped striped insects with wings. (Bees are thought by some entomologists to have evolved from predatory wasps.) However, closer examination of both their appearances and their behavior reveals some key differences. (Adult yellow jackets subsist on nectar and other sources of sugars. They hunt animal food only to nourish their squirmy white little sisters, which in return secrete a nourishing fluid.) Yellow jackets exhibit further adaptations to their raiding ways: aerodynamic and nipped at the waist, they are perfectly suited to taking down other insects or darting in to grab their share of whatever carrion and waste is on offer. Honeybees, in contrast, have no need of such exacting maneuverability as they bop from flower to flower; this is reflected in their more-rounded form, their bodies not tapering to the fighter-jet points of the yellow jacket. So, too, it is reflected in their neighborly absence from your outdoor repast; the human palate craves victuals totally unappetizing to bees. The next time, then, that one of your lunch companions bolts from the picnic table sounding the bee alarm, you might advise him or her as to the true identity of the culprit. And then, once the spread has been safely sealed from prying insects, perhaps invite your companions for a stroll and, along with the real bees, stop and enjoy the flowers.

Content: Success consists of going from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm. So goes the aphorism attributed (probably wrongly) to Winston Churchill. Whatever the provenance of the quote, these organisms have taken the message to heart. They’ve surmounted disease, starvation, predation, and human intervention to become the most populous species of their respective taxonomic categories, evincing an unwavering enthusiasm for reproduction and a terrifying degree of fecundity. Of course, it is impossible to obtain exact population counts for many creatures, especially those with secretive or nocturnal lifestyles or those that are almost ubiquituous. So, some of these are merely inferences based on the breadth of a particular species’ range or on other extrapolations from the best available information. I’ve ignored invasive species, and, especially, domesticated species, some of which number well into the billions. It hardly comes as a surprise that ants are the most numerous insect in the world. These colonial hymenopterans may number from 10-100,000 trillion individuals globally; there are more than 10,000 species. The springtails, or Collembola, used to hold the title, but they are no longer officially insects, but rather part of a larger subphylum that includes insects and several related creatures. Though a few species are considered pests, ants are hugely benefical in most environments, spreading seeds and disposing of detritus as they forage for food. The copepods, in addition to being the world’s most numerous crustacean, may also in fact be the world’s most populous multi-celled organism. Found in fresh and salt water worldwide, the roughly 12,000 species are key participants in all of the ecosystems they inhabit. Most are vase-shaped creatures only several millimeters long. Moving through the water by means of paddle-like appendages, they ravenously hunt down tinier organisms such as bacteria and algae, and are in turn food for organisms as diverse as fish fry and baleen whales. Some are even parasitic. Their numbers are such that divers often hear a crackling sound around them as millons of copepods move through the current. The bristlemouths, or lightfishes, are considered the most numerous fish on the planet, exceeding even the famously plentiful herring in numbers, and are also the most numerous vertebrate, period. They comprise the family Gonostomatidae, which contains over 30 species. Bristlemouths are deep sea fishes, and, as befitting their pitch-black environs, boast rows of light-emitting organs called photophores along their sides. These monstrous little creatures form a key component of the ocean  . Their ubiquity contrasts with their fragility: bristlemouths brought to the surface by deep-sea trawling are often damaged. Though perfectly suited to the ocean deep, their delicate black or translucent skins are no match for the abrasions and pressures changes sustained during capture. Just be glad the little suckers are aquatic...the oral "bristles" that give them their name look kind of stabby to me. The most numerous species of amphibian is almost certainly a frog. Exactly which species of the slick-skinned critters is most populous remains unknown. The order Anura, which comprises frogs and toads, contains some 5,500 species, but many are rare or found only within a limited range. The common frog ( ) ranges across much of Europe and the wood frog ( ) can be found plopping into the waters of even the more northerly portions of North America, which would make these species good bets. However, the fully aquatic African clawed frog ( ) can be found throughout most of the African continent, particularly the southern portion, so it may give its cousins a run for their money. Whichever species boasts the most specimens, the likelihood of biblical plagues of frogs swarming modern cities is ever-diminishing: amphibians world-wide are threatened by the chytrid fungus, which can wipe out entire populations. There are few firm estimates as to which species of reptile is actually the most numerous. There are a couple of likely guesses, though. The viviparous lizard inhabits a huge swath of Europe and Asia, from the U.K. and France to Japan and Russia; it can even tolerate the lower regions of the Arctic. Its name refers to its ability to give birth to live young in the colder regions of its range. The dozen or so species of garter snake that populate most of North America may come close in biomass. Whichever reptile it is, you can be sure it’s a lizard or snake. These creatures, which form the order Squamata, comprise the bulk of the Reptilia. Even herpetophobes can take comfort in the fact that the majority of these species are completely harmless. They also gobble up crop-damaging, disease-bearing rodents and insects, so there’s that. Imagine Tippi Hedren’s horror. Native to some two-thirds of Africa, the red-billed quelea ( ) is thought to be the most numerous species of bird on Earth. Estimates of the species’s population, which fluctuates from season to season, put the number of individual queleas at 1 to 10 billion. These birds closely resemble sparrows and finches, but are only distantly related. They form enormous flocks that migrate as the availability of the grass seeds they eat changes. They are among the most significant agricultural pests in Africa. With large flocks capable of decimating harvests, remediation measures such as aerial spraying with poison have been implemented, meaning that predators and scavengers who devour the avian amuse-bouche are poisoned as well.  Humans are likely the most numerous species of mammal on Earth at the moment. Having reached some 7 billion in 2011, we outnumber our fellow furries by a wide margin. The only species that may come close to (or exceed) us in numbers are the brown rat ( ) and house mouse ( ), whose evolutionary histories and distribution are closely tied to our own. Given that these rodents are unlikely to develop literacy skills and begin sending in census forms—NIMH escapees excepted—we’ll probably never know. Not sure which is grosser...more than 7 billion rats or more than 7 billion people.

Hormones called   and juvenile hormones, which are not species specific, apparently regulate the changes. These physical changes as well as those involving growth and differentiation are accompanied by alterations of the organism’s physiology, biochemistry, and behaviour. The immature forms, or larvae, are adapted to   and modes of life that differ from those of the   forms. These differences may be of significance in assuring that larvae and adults of the same species do not engage in direct competition for food or living space. Examples of   include the tadpole, an aquatic larval stage that transforms into the land-dwelling frog (class Amphibia). Starfishes and other echinoderms undergo a metamorphosis that includes a change from the bilateral symmetry of the larva to the radial symmetry of the adult. Metamorphic patterns are well-known in crabs, lobsters, and other crustaceans and also in snails, clams, and other mollusks. The larval form of the   (  the tunicate, or sea squirt) is tadpole-like and free swimming; the adult is sessile and somewhat degenerate. Among the most dramatic and thoroughly studied examples of metamorphosis are the  . Because development is not the same in all insects, it is convenient to group them into major categories according to the pattern of structural changes:  , hemimetabolous, and holometabolous. In ametabolous development there is simply a gradual increase in the size of young until adult dimensions are attained. This kind of development occurs in the  , springtail, and other primitive insects. In more advanced insects (  grasshoppers, termites, true bugs) a phenomenon known as gradual, or  , metamorphosis occurs. The hemimetabolous life cycle consists of egg,  , and adult. The nymph, or immature  , resembles the adult in form and eating habits, differing in size, body proportions, and colour pattern.   wings are visible and develop externally. Development is gradual through a series of molts (periodic shedding of the outer skeleton), the adult emerging from the final molt. Complete, or  , metamorphosis is characteristic of beetles, butterflies and moths, flies, and wasps. Their life cycle includes four stages: egg,   ( ),   ( ), and adult. The larva differs greatly from the adult. It is wingless, and its form and habits are suited for growth and development rather than reproduction. The change to the adult occurs during the inactive, nonfeeding pupal stage. At this time the larva undergoes a   in which the wings appear externally, larval organs and tissues are broken down, and adult structures are developed.  , a form of complete metamorphosis, occurs in some beetles, flies, and other insects and is characterized by a series of larval stages.

In some species the larva is free-living and the adult is an attached or nonmobile form; in others the larva is aquatic and the adult lives on land. In forms with nonmobile adults, the mobile larva increases the geographic distribution of the species. Such larvae have well-developed locomotor structures. A larva sometimes functions as a food gatherer—in many species the larval stage occurs at a time when food is abundant—and has a well-developed alimentary system. It stores food so that the transformation to the adult stage can occur. Some larvae function in both dispersion and nutrition. The amount of time in the   spent in the larval stage varies among species. Some have long larval periods, either hatching early, metamorphosing into adults late, or both.

For full treatment,     and  . Physically, early and middle adulthood are marked by slow, gradual declines in body functioning, which accelerate as old age is reached. The muscle mass continues to increase through the mid-20s, thereafter gradually decreasing. The skeletal mass increases until age 30 or so, and then begins to decrease, first in the central skeleton (pelvis and spine) and last in the   skeleton (fingers and toes). Throughout adulthood there is a progressive   of cholesterol in the arteries, and the   eventually grows weaker even in the absence of detectable disease. The production of both male and female hormones also diminishes with age, though this cannot be directly related to the gradual diminution in sexual activity that occurs in both males and females between 20 and 60. There is clear evidence that with increasing age adults display a slow, very gradual tendency toward decreasing speed of response in the execution of intellectual (and physical) tasks. Slowing rates of electrical activity in the older adult brain have been linked to the slowing of behaviour itself. This decline in the rate of   processing does not necessarily imply similar changes in learning, memory, or other intellectual functions.

Typical castes in insect societies include the queen, the sexual female responsible for reproduction; the workers, the usually sterile caretakers of the queen and her eggs and larvae; and the soldiers, defenders of the colony (and also sterile). Morphological differences between castes, which enable their members’ performance of different tasks, are sometimes noted; e.g., the pollen basket on the legs of the worker honeybee ( ) does not exist on the queen. In many insect species, differentiation of insect larvae into various castes is determined by diet, although hormonal and environmental factors can also affect development. Some insects also produce worker or soldier subcastes, which are morphologically and functionally distinct. The subcastes of   ants are among the best characterized. These ants are capable of producing minor and major subcastes; minors perform foraging duties, while majors, which have large bodies and heads, are involved primarily in defense. A reduction in the population of minors causes majors to take over their duties, thereby promoting colony survival. Eight species of   ants, all found in the southwestern  , produce a third subcaste, known as super majors (or supersoldiers); this subcaste may allow these species to utilize   food resources (e.g., large seeds) that other   are unable to access.

Hormones carry out their functions by evoking responses from specific   or   that are adapted to react to minute quantities of them. The classical view of hormones is that they are transmitted to their targets in the bloodstream after discharge from the glands that secrete them. This mode of discharge (directly into the bloodstream) is called    . The meaning of the term   has been extended beyond the original definition of a  -borne secretion, however, to include similar regulatory substances that are distributed by   across   membranes instead of by a blood system. Hormonal regulation is closely related to that exerted by the  , and the two processes have generally been distinguished by the rate at which each causes effects, the duration of these effects, and their extent; i.e., the effects of endocrine regulation may be slow to develop but prolonged in influence and widely distributed through the body, whereas nervous regulation is typically concerned with quick responses that are of brief duration and localized in their effects. Advances in knowledge, however, have modified these distinctions.  are secretory, for responses to the nerve impulses that they   depend upon the production of   substances, or  , such as   and   (noradrenaline), which are liberated at nerve endings in minute amounts and have only a momentary action. It has been established, however, that certain specialized nerve cells, called  , can translate neural signals into chemical stimuli by producing secretions called  . These secretions, which are often polypeptides (compounds similar to   but composed of fewer  ), pass along nerve-cell extensions, or axons, and are typically released into the bloodstream at special regions called  , where the   endings are in close contact with blood  . Once released in this way, neurohormones function in principle similar to hormones that are   in the bloodstream and are synthesized in the endocrine glands. The distinctions between neural and endocrine regulation, no longer as clear-cut as they once seemed to be, are further weakened by the fact that neurosecretory nerve endings are sometimes so close to their target cells that vascular transmission is not necessary. There is good evidence that hormonal regulation occurs by diffusion in plants and (although here the evidence is largely indirect) in lower animals (e.g., coelenterates), which lack a  . Hormones have a long evolutionary history, knowledge of which is important if their properties and functions are to be understood. Many important features of the    , for example, are present in the lampreys and hagfishes, modern representatives of the primitively jawless vertebrates ( ), and these features were presumably present in   ancestors that lived more than 500 million years ago. The evolution of the endocrine system in the more advanced vertebrates with jaws ( ) has involved both the appearance of new hormones and the further evolution of some of those already present in agnathans; in addition, extensive specialization of target organs has occurred to permit new patterns of response. The factors involved in the first appearance of the various hormones is largely a matter for conjecture, although hormones clearly are only one mechanism for chemical regulation,   forms of which are found in living things at all stages of development. Other mechanisms for chemical regulation include chemical substances (so-called organizer substances) that regulate early embryonic development and the pheromones that are released by social insects as sex attractants and regulators of the social organization. Perhaps, in some instances, chemical regulators including hormones appeared first as metabolic by-products. A few such substances are known in physiological regulation:  , for example, is involved in the regulation of the respiratory activity of which it is a product, in insects as well as in vertebrates. Substances such as carbon dioxide are called  parahormones to distinguish them from true hormones, which are specialized secretions.

Insect bodies have three segments: head, thorax (which bears three pairs of legs and usually two pairs of wings), and many-segmented abdomen. Many species undergo complete metamorphosis. There are two subclasses: Apterygota (primitive, wingless forms, including silverfish and bristletails) and Pterygota (more advanced, winged or secondarily wingless forms). The approximately 27 orders of Pterygota are generally classified by wing form: e.g., Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera ( ), Heteroptera (bugs). Insects are found in almost all terrestrial and freshwater and some marine habitats.

Content: Success consists of going from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm. So goes the aphorism attributed (probably wrongly) to Winston Churchill. Whatever the provenance of the quote, these organisms have taken the message to heart. They’ve surmounted disease, starvation, predation, and human intervention to become the most populous species of their respective taxonomic categories, evincing an unwavering enthusiasm for reproduction and a terrifying degree of fecundity. Of course, it is impossible to obtain exact population counts for many creatures, especially those with secretive or nocturnal lifestyles or those that are almost ubiquituous. So, some of these are merely inferences based on the breadth of a particular species’ range or on other extrapolations from the best available information. I’ve ignored invasive species, and, especially, domesticated species, some of which number well into the billions. It hardly comes as a surprise that ants are the most numerous insect in the world. These colonial hymenopterans may number from 10-100,000 trillion individuals globally; there are more than 10,000 species. The springtails, or Collembola, used to hold the title, but they are no longer officially insects, but rather part of a larger subphylum that includes insects and several related creatures. Though a few species are considered pests, ants are hugely benefical in most environments, spreading seeds and disposing of detritus as they forage for food. The copepods, in addition to being the world’s most numerous crustacean, may also in fact be the world’s most populous multi-celled organism. Found in fresh and salt water worldwide, the roughly 12,000 species are key participants in all of the ecosystems they inhabit. Most are vase-shaped creatures only several millimeters long. Moving through the water by means of paddle-like appendages, they ravenously hunt down tinier organisms such as bacteria and algae, and are in turn food for organisms as diverse as fish fry and baleen whales. Some are even parasitic. Their numbers are such that divers often hear a crackling sound around them as millons of copepods move through the current. The bristlemouths, or lightfishes, are considered the most numerous fish on the planet, exceeding even the famously plentiful herring in numbers, and are also the most numerous vertebrate, period. They comprise the family Gonostomatidae, which contains over 30 species. Bristlemouths are deep sea fishes, and, as befitting their pitch-black environs, boast rows of light-emitting organs called photophores along their sides. These monstrous little creatures form a key component of the ocean  . Their ubiquity contrasts with their fragility: bristlemouths brought to the surface by deep-sea trawling are often damaged. Though perfectly suited to the ocean deep, their delicate black or translucent skins are no match for the abrasions and pressures changes sustained during capture. Just be glad the little suckers are aquatic...the oral "bristles" that give them their name look kind of stabby to me. The most numerous species of amphibian is almost certainly a frog. Exactly which species of the slick-skinned critters is most populous remains unknown. The order Anura, which comprises frogs and toads, contains some 5,500 species, but many are rare or found only within a limited range. The common frog ( ) ranges across much of Europe and the wood frog ( ) can be found plopping into the waters of even the more northerly portions of North America, which would make these species good bets. However, the fully aquatic African clawed frog ( ) can be found throughout most of the African continent, particularly the southern portion, so it may give its cousins a run for their money. Whichever species boasts the most specimens, the likelihood of biblical plagues of frogs swarming modern cities is ever-diminishing: amphibians world-wide are threatened by the chytrid fungus, which can wipe out entire populations. There are few firm estimates as to which species of reptile is actually the most numerous. There are a couple of likely guesses, though. The viviparous lizard inhabits a huge swath of Europe and Asia, from the U.K. and France to Japan and Russia; it can even tolerate the lower regions of the Arctic. Its name refers to its ability to give birth to live young in the colder regions of its range. The dozen or so species of garter snake that populate most of North America may come close in biomass. Whichever reptile it is, you can be sure it’s a lizard or snake. These creatures, which form the order Squamata, comprise the bulk of the Reptilia. Even herpetophobes can take comfort in the fact that the majority of these species are completely harmless. They also gobble up crop-damaging, disease-bearing rodents and insects, so there’s that. Imagine Tippi Hedren’s horror. Native to some two-thirds of Africa, the red-billed quelea ( ) is thought to be the most numerous species of bird on Earth. Estimates of the species’s population, which fluctuates from season to season, put the number of individual queleas at 1 to 10 billion. These birds closely resemble sparrows and finches, but are only distantly related. They form enormous flocks that migrate as the availability of the grass seeds they eat changes. They are among the most significant agricultural pests in Africa. With large flocks capable of decimating harvests, remediation measures such as aerial spraying with poison have been implemented, meaning that predators and scavengers who devour the avian amuse-bouche are poisoned as well.  Humans are likely the most numerous species of mammal on Earth at the moment. Having reached some 7 billion in 2011, we outnumber our fellow furries by a wide margin. The only species that may come close to (or exceed) us in numbers are the brown rat ( ) and house mouse ( ), whose evolutionary histories and distribution are closely tied to our own. Given that these rodents are unlikely to develop literacy skills and begin sending in census forms—NIMH escapees excepted—we’ll probably never know. Not sure which is grosser...more than 7 billion rats or more than 7 billion people.

Content: There’s another food revolution coming. And it isn’t a quiet one. It’s practically buzzing. And clicking. And crunching. It’s almost orchestral, really, in a tinny, droning sort of way. That’s right: an increasing number of scientists suggest that if we’re to support our booming population in the coming decades, we must turn to new sources of protein, namely, in the form of insects. If the leaps in grain production in the late 1960s—attributable to genetic engineering and improved agricultural techniques—constituted a Green Revolution, this is a protein revolution. It’s not going to go down easy, not in the Western world at least. Though residents of equatorial countries have long availed themselves of the protein-rich flesh of insects, Westerners usually still find their gorges rising at the thought of ingesting a single bug, let alone a risotto studded with them. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) wants to find ways around this squeamishness. In doing so, it turned to a cadre of entomologists, food scientists, and other experts, who issued a report on the subject in 2013. Notably, the report emphasized that raising insects for food uses substantially fewer resources than raising large vertebrate livestock. The lead author, entomologist Arnold van Huis, says, “Crickets, grasshoppers and locusts are my favorites, in particular when they are nicely cooked and seasoned. Deep-fried, they can also become nicely crunchy.” What is the name for an insect’s egg-laying organ? How many known species of insects are there? You may...

Content: Oh no, it’s a bug! There are many different kinds of insects in many different shapes and sizes. Some frighten people, while others delight them. And some play an important role in helping people get healthy. This list will help you gain a greater understanding of bugs.  The Handy Answer Book for Kids (and Parents)   are small creatures with three pairs of legs, a body with three main parts (a head, thorax, and abdomen), and a tough shell-like outer covering, called an exoskeleton. Insects are  , which means they do not have a backbone. Most have one or two pairs of wings and a pair of antennae. There are about 1,000,000 known species of insects in the world, and entomologists (scientists who study bugs) estimate that there are millions (perhaps up to 10 million!) more yet to be discovered. Insects are everywhere—there are more bugs in 1 square mile (about 2.6 sq km) of rural land than there are human beings on the entire globe. Insects are divided into 32 orders, or groups. The largest insect order is the beetles ( ) with 200 different families and approximately 400,000 different species. In fact, one out of every four animals on Earth is some type of beetle. In the United States, there are some 73,000 species of insects: approximately 24,000 beetles, 19,500  , 17,500  ,  , and  , and 11,500   and  .  grow through the process of  , meaning that they undergo change. Insect groups that undergo a complete metamorphosis include beetles, moths, butterflies, sawflies, wasps, ants, bees, and flies. All these groups begin their   as an  . The egg hatches into a  —such as a caterpillar, grub, or maggot—that feeds, molts (sheds its skin), and grows larger. The larva goes through an inactive   stage—for example, it is wrapped up in a cocoon—and emerges as an adult insect, such as a butterfly or beetle, that looks very different from the larva it once was.  Other insect groups do not go through a complete metamorphosis; instead, they experience gradual changes as they turn into adults. These include scales, aphids, cicadas, leafhoppers, true bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, praying mantises, cockroaches, earwigs, and dragonflies. Immature forms of these insects are called nymphs. The   grow and gradually change size, shedding their skin along the way. After a final molt, the full adult form emerges.  and other   fly from one plant to the next so as to feed on the sweet  —and sometimes the  —located in the interior of  . The sugar in nectar supplies insects with the energy they need, and pollen contains protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals. In the process of feeding, many insects transfer pollen—which sticks to their bodies—from one plant’s flower to another.  Pollen, which is a fine powdery grain from a flower’s male reproductive organ, must be transferred to the female reproductive organ of a flower for fertilization to take place and seeds to form. Most adult  , including   and  , have two large  , made up of separate lenses. Sometimes these eyes have thousands of lenses. They all point in different directions to give the insect a very wide field of vision. The lenses also help the insect see movement, enabling it to react quickly to seize its prey or escape danger. You can witness this yourself as you try to swat a fly in your home—it’s very difficult to catch a flying insect! The large round spots on the wings of   and  , which look like big round eyes, are a defense mechanism. When a bird or other animal tries to eat the insect, the insect opens its wings and begins to fly off. The wing movement reveals the moth’s “eyes,” confusing the insect’s enemy by  . The predator hesitates, and the insect is able to escape. Yes.   are   that live in colonies, or underground chambers, which may house as many as 500,000 individuals. Ant chambers are connected to each other and to the surface of the earth by small tunnels. There are rooms for food storage, rooms for mating, and nurseries for the young. A queen produces eggs to supply new ants for the colony. The colony is built and maintained by legions of worker ants, who carry tiny bits of dirt in their mandibles (a pair of appendages near the insect’s mouth) and deposit them near the exit of the colony, forming an ant hill.  While most ant colonies are self-sufficient, Amazon ants, which are aggressive red ants (genus  ) found in the western U.S., steal the   of other ants so as to use them as workers—to build homes for and feed the Amazon ants, who do nothing but fight. They depend completely on these “enslaved” ants for survival. That depends on what you mean by the word  . The   often cited as the   is   (also classified as  ), which lives in western  . These insects can be 22 inches (56 cm) long! They are related to the group of insects called walkingsticks.   get their name from the fact that they do, indeed, look like sticks with legs. The largest walkingsticks can grow to up to 13 inches (33 centimeters) in length. There are approximately 3,000 tropical species of walkingsticks, and 10 species that live in North America. One species,  , is the longest insect in the United States, reaching 7 inches (17.7 cm) in length. If you are talking about the   insect, then take a look at the giant weta ( ), an   insect that can weigh up to two and a half ounces (71 g). These insects may look ferocious and scary because of their size, but they are actually harmless. Another insect that is often considered the biggest is the Actaeon beetle ( ) because it is very bulky looking and can be as big as 3.5 inches (9 cm) long by 2 inches (5 cm) wide and 1.5 inches (4 cm) thick. The  , also called a praying mantid, is a large flesh-eating insect that lives in warm areas of the world. Mantis species from Europe and China were introduced to the northeastern United States many decades ago for use as pest exterminators on farms and in gardens. These   insects—sometimes called “vicious predators”—are among the few insects that can rotate their heads to look over their shoulders, making them extremely effective hunters. They pose in a deceptively humble posture when searching for food, as if their front legs are folded in prayer. Mantises grab their victims with their raptorial front legs, which quickly shoot out from their bodies. Mantises almost always start eating their catch while it is alive, and they often start eating their victim’s neck to quickly end the struggle.  Praying mantises eat a variety of insects—other mantises, beetles, butterflies,  ,  —and  . They also eat small  ,  ,  ,  , and other nesting birds. Because they keep down the populations of “bad bugs” that threaten farms, they are highly useful to agricultural workers. Many people think of   as insects, but actually they are classified in a separate category. Spiders are part of a group called  , which also includes  ,  , and  . Arachnids share many features with their arthropod cousins, but they differ in that they do not have antennae. Spiders also have eight legs (insects have six), and spiders’ bodies are segmented into two parts (insects’ bodies have three parts). Both   and   maggots are used occasionally in the field of medicine. The U.S. federal government’s   considers both bugs “approved medical devices,” the first live animals to be called that name. Blow fly maggots are used to eat dead tissue, thus helping to kill  , clean open wounds, and stimulate healing. Leeches   from the body, and their saliva contains a powerful blood thinner.

This period of suspended development is an apparent response to the approach of adverse environmental conditions. It may occur during any life stage but is most common among   (  the cocoons of moths). Diapause sets in when the bodily concentrations of growth and molting hormones decrease, which usually coincides with changes in day length,  , or abundance of food.

The   and  , here classified as separate orders, sometimes are considered as suborders of an order Hemiptera. Both groups have piercing-sucking mouthparts; for this reason, they are thought to be closely related to each other. Some entomologists, however, consider distinguishing features other than the mouthparts sufficiently important to accord full ordinal status to each group. The term   frequently is used to describe three closely related groups, classified here as three distinct orders: Neuroptera (lacewings), Raphidiodea (snakeflies), and Megaloptera (dobsonflies and alderflies). Although the tendency has been to classify these groups as distinct orders, they sometimes are placed in the order Neuroptera.

For full treatment,     and  . Physically, early and middle adulthood are marked by slow, gradual declines in body functioning, which accelerate as old age is reached. The muscle mass continues to increase through the mid-20s, thereafter gradually decreasing. The skeletal mass increases until age 30 or so, and then begins to decrease, first in the central skeleton (pelvis and spine) and last in the   skeleton (fingers and toes). Throughout adulthood there is a progressive   of cholesterol in the arteries, and the   eventually grows weaker even in the absence of detectable disease. The production of both male and female hormones also diminishes with age, though this cannot be directly related to the gradual diminution in sexual activity that occurs in both males and females between 20 and 60. There is clear evidence that with increasing age adults display a slow, very gradual tendency toward decreasing speed of response in the execution of intellectual (and physical) tasks. Slowing rates of electrical activity in the older adult brain have been linked to the slowing of behaviour itself. This decline in the rate of   processing does not necessarily imply similar changes in learning, memory, or other intellectual functions. The learning   of young adults is superior to that of older adults, as is their ability to organize new information in terms of its content or meaning. Older adults, on the other hand, are equal or superior to young adults in their capacity to retain general information and in their accumulated cultural knowledge.    ;  .

It seems quite probable that the development of metamorphosis occurred more than once during the   of insects. Insects did not evolve in a constant  . Throughout geological time there were prodigious changes in climate; in addition, evolution was continuous among all other animals and plants. Geologically the selection pressures among insects were changing continuously. At the end of the   the first   plants appeared. Insect evolution has paralleled that of the flowering plants; they have evolved together. As   (butterflies and moths),   (ants, bees, and wasps),   (true flies), and   (beetles) began to feed upon  ,  , or  , flowering plants came to rely more and more upon insects—rather than upon the wind—for transferring their  . Flowers evolved nectaries, scents, and   colours as attractants for those insects that could effect cross- . Insects likewise evolved appropriate mouthpart modifications for extracting nectar from flowers. During the Mesozoic warm-blooded animals (  and  ) first appeared; by the dawn of the  , they had become predominant among Earth’s large animals. The warm fermenting excrement and the decaying dead bodies of mammals furnished excellent nutrient media for many insect larvae, notably among the Diptera and Coleoptera. The adults in both groups found their nourishment in flowers. Some heteropterans (true bugs) and dipterans pierce the skin of birds and mammals and feed on their  . The   (sucking lice) and the   (fleas) have become so specialized for this type of parasitic existence that their relationships to other insects are not   known with certainty. Evolution is occurring among present-day insects. They exhibit a balanced genetic  ; in other words, in response to small environmental changes, one genetic form, more successful than another, will become more plentiful. Sometimes there is no visible difference between these forms, the advantage presumably lying in some physiological change. It is advantageous for a   to have a   from which favourable characters can be selected so that the species can respond to environmental changes. Changes within a species may occur progressively over a large geographical area. Such a progressive genetic change is called a cline; in some cases insects at the extremes of the cline are so unlike that they are taken as separate species and may be infertile when crossed. One well-known example of evolution in action among insects is   (accumulation of the black pigment  ); many butterflies   industrial areas have become almost black, the black forms being more tolerant of   and less conspicuous to predators. Another example of this  cline type of evolution is the development of insect strains resistant to an   that has been applied heavily in an area for several years. In many parts of the world houseflies became highly resistant to  . The class Insecta is divided into orders on the basis of the structure of the  , including eyes,  , and antennae; the  , including legs and wings; and the  , including segmentation, spiracles, and appendages (cerci, styli, furcula). The genitalia and their accessory structures, usually located in the ninth abdominal segment, are important in  . Other taxonomic   include bristles (their form and arrangement are known as chaetotaxy), sensory receptors (spines, hairs, sensilla, tympanal organs), pattern of wing venation, and position of mouthparts. In addition, type of   and form of larva and   are used to distinguish insects.

					 The insect   has many gaps. Among the primitive apterygotes, only the collembolans ( ) have been found as fossils in the   (about 419.2 million to 358.9 million years ago). Ten insect orders are known as fossils, mostly of Late   and   times (318 million to 251 million years ago). No fossils have yet been found from the Late Devonian (about 382.7 million to 358.9 million years ago) or Early Carboniferous (about 358.9 million to 318 million years ago) period, when the key characters of present-day insects are believed to have evolved; thus, early evolution must be inferred from the   of   insects. It has become evident that insect  , like that of other animals, was far more active at some periods than at others. There have been geological epochs of “explosive” evolution during which many new forms have appeared. Those epochs may have followed some modification or   in body function, or new developments favoured by climatic changes or evolutionary advances of other   and  . During those periods of evolutionary change, new methods of feeding and living led to   of insect   and limbs, the origin of  , and other changes. The simplified family tree shown here illustrates the presumed evolutionary history of winged insects ( ) throughout the geological periods from the Devonian to the Recent. The apterygotes, which are regarded as survivors of primitive insect stock, are omitted from the family tree. Dark lines indicate the periods during which the various orders have been found as fossils. Some lines stop at the names of orders now extinct and known only as fossils. Light lines indicate the   origin of various orders. Many insect types, traces of which have not yet been discovered, must have been produced during the explosive periods of evolution in   and Permian times. The primitive wingless insects gave rise to a paleopterous stock. Descendants of this stock included ancient fossil types that flourished in Permian times, such as the giant dragonflies or   (some of which had a wing span of more than half a metre) and the dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) and mayflies (Ephemeroptera), both of which have   with little change to the present. The primitive insect stock also gave rise to a neopterous stock, believed to include the progenitors of the remaining insect orders. The Orthoptera (grasshoppers) and the   ( ) have been found as fossils even in late Carboniferous times. The   ( , sometimes placed in the order Blattodea),   ( ), and   ( ), though doubtless of ancient origin, have not been found yet as fossils dated earlier than the   (252 million to 66 million years ago). The evolutionary radiation believed to have given rise to the orders listed above in the Middle Carboniferous Period is thought to have also produced a paraneopterous stock, which formed the base for a new evolutionary radiation during the  . Present-day derivatives of this stock evolved into the   ( ),   ( ),   or Siphunculata ( ), Thysanoptera ( ),   (true bugs), and   (e.g., aphids). Several phylogenetic lines are exopterygote—i.e., insects with simple  , some of which, such as Mallophaga and Anoplura, are secondarily wingless. The remaining orders are endopterygote (insects with complete metamorphosis). They are shown in the family tree as derivatives of an oligoneopterous stock, which gave rise to   ( ),   (ants, wasps, and bees), and   (beetles) in the Early Permian Period (298.9 million to 272.3 million years ago); the early ancestry of these orders is obscure, however, and the earliest fossils closely resemble present-day forms. One line from the evolutionary radiation at the beginning of the Permian gave rise to a mecopteroid stock, and there is good evidence that a sub-radiation of these mecopteroid orders (sometimes called the panorpoid complex) provided the origin for the present   ( ),   (true flies),   (fleas),   (caddisflies), and   (butterflies and moths). Insect wings develop as paired outgrowths from the  , stiffened by ribs, or veins, in which run tracheae. These tracheae follow a consistent pattern throughout the Pterygota, and their specific modifications (known as  ) are important in   and in estimations of the degree of relationship between groups. The basic consistency of venation suggests that wings have been evolved only once among the insects; that is, all the Pterygota arose from a single stem in the family tree. By the time fossil insects are found (toward the end of the Carboniferous), wings are developed fully. In the   the wings are held aloft above the back, as in mayflies, or held extended permanently on each side of the body, as in dragonflies. Throughout the   there is a wing-flexing mechanism (secondarily lost in butterflies) that enables the wings to be folded back to rest on the surface of the  . Winged insects must have made their appearance very early in the Carboniferous, but there is no fossil evidence to show the way they evolved. One   is that wings arose as fixed planes extending sideways from the thorax and that these planes were used, perhaps in some large leaping insect, for gliding. Later muscles developed, first to control inclination and then to move the wings in flapping flight. Another hypothesis is that wings may have originated from large thoracic    , similar to the movable tracheal gills along the abdomen of some    . Such outgrowths could have been useful to insects exposed by the drying up of a temporary aquatic habitat and might have carried them in rain-bearing winds to a new watery home. It is likely that the most primitive symphylan-like insects were terrestrial. Throughout insect evolution, however, independent   to aquatic habitats have occurred. Usually the pattern is one in which the adults leave the water and disperse. Many pterygote insects have become secondarily wingless, sometimes as single   or groups of species within large orders and sometimes as entire orders (the parasitic  , Mallophaga and Anoplura, and the fleas, Siphonaptera).

Although the brain of higher vertebrates undergoes considerable modification during embryonic development, these three regions are still discernible. The hindbrain is composed of the   and the  . The medulla transmits signals between the   and the higher parts of the brain; it also controls such autonomic functions as heartbeat and respiration. The pons is partly made up of tracts connecting the spinal cord with higher brain levels, and it also contains cell groups that transfer information from the cerebrum to the cerebellum. The midbrain, the upper portion of which evolved from the optic lobes, is the main centre of sensory   in   and  . It also is involved with integration in   and  .

The  , originally functioning as part of the olfactory lobes, is involved with the more complex functions of the human brain. In humans and other advanced vertebrates, the cerebrum has grown over the rest of the brain, forming a   (wrinkled) layer of  . The degree of convolution is partly dependent on the size of the body. Small mammals (e.g., lesser  ,  ) generally have smooth brains, and large mammals (e.g.,  ,  ,  ) generally have highly convoluted ones. The   are separated by a deep groove, the longitudinal cerebral  . At the base of this fissure lies a thick bundle of nerve fibres, called the  , which provides a communication link between the hemispheres. The left hemisphere controls the right half of the body, and vice versa, because of a crossing of the nerve fibres in the medulla or, less commonly, in the spinal cord. Although the right and left hemispheres are mirror images of one another in many ways, there are important functional distinctions. In most people, for example, the areas that control speech are located in the left hemisphere, while areas that control   perceptions are located in the right hemisphere. Two major furrows—the   and the lateral sulcus—divide each cerebral hemisphere into four sections: the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The central sulcus, also known as the fissure of Rolando, also separates the cortical motor area (which is anterior to the fissure) from the cortical sensory area (which is posterior to the fissure). Starting from the top of the hemisphere, the upper regions of the motor and sensory areas control the lower parts of the body, and the lower regions of the motor and sensory areas control the upper parts of the body. Other functional areas of the cerebral hemispheres have been identified, including the visual cortex in the occipital lobe and the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. A large amount of the   cortex, however, is devoted to no specific motor or sensory function; this so-called association cortex is apparently involved in higher mental activities.

					 The   consists of a series of   that supply nerves to successive segments of the body. The three main ganglia in the   (protocerebrum, deutocerebrum, and tritocerebrum) commonly are fused to form the  , or supraesophageal ganglion. The rest of the ganglionic chain lies below the   against the ventral body surface. The brain is joined by paired connectives to the subesophageal ganglion, which is linked in turn by paired connectives to the three thoracic and eight abdominal ganglia (numbered according to segment). In most insects the number of separate ganglia has been reduced by  . The last abdominal ganglion always serves several segments. In homopterans and heteropterans all the abdominal ganglia usually fuse with mesothoracic and metathoracic ganglia; and in the   of higher flies (Cyclorrhapha), the ganglia of the brain,  , and   form one mass. Each ganglion is made up of   bodies that lie on the   and a mass of nerve fibres, the neuropile, that occupies the centre. There are two types of nerve cells,   and  association neurons. Motor neurons have main processes, or  , that extend from the ganglia to contractile muscles, and minor processes, or  , that connect with the  . Association neurons, usually smaller than motor neurons, are linked with other parts of the   by way of the neuropile. Cell bodies of the sense organs, called  , lie at the periphery of the body just below the  . Sensory neurons occur as single cells or small   of cells; the distal process, or dendrite, of each cell extends to a cuticular sense organ ( ). The sensilla are usually small hairs modified for perception of specific stimuli (e.g., touch, smell, taste, heat, cold); each sensillum consists of one sense cell and one  . Although these small sense organs occur all over the body, they are particularly abundant in  , palps, and cerci. The sense cell of each sensillum gives off a proximal process, or sensory axon, which runs inward to the central nervous system, where it enters the neuropile and makes contact with the endings of association neurons. Bundles of both sensory axons and motor axons, which are enclosed in protective membranous sheaths,   the nerves.    may be sensitive enough to perceive air vibrations and thus serve as organs for  . Tympanal organs (eardrums) are present in certain butterflies and grasshoppers. Mechanical sensilla (chordotonal organs) below the surface of the cuticle serve for perception of internal strains and body movements. The eyes are of two kinds, simple eyes, or  , and  . In the adults of higher insects both types are present. The visual sense cells are derived from the epidermis, as are those of other sense organs, and are connected to the optic ganglia (a part of the brain) by sensory axons. Each visual sense cell has a zone at its surface, which, on exposure to  , gives rise to chemical products that stimulate the sense cell, called the  retinula cell, and initiate the nerve impulse in the sensory axon. The light-receptive zone, or  , of the retinula cell commonly has a rodlike form; because it lies perpendicular to the surface, light passes lengthwise along it. In the simple eyes (ocelli) a lens-shaped area of cuticle lies over the group of retinula cells that form the  . Since the optical structure is primitive, the visual image received is crude; ocelli can perceive only light, darkness, and movement. The   eye, made up of a number of facets, resembles a honeycomb; each facet overlies a group of six or seven retinal cells that surround the rhabdom. Each of the retinal units below a single facet is termed an ommatidium. The number of facets varies. For example, there are only a few dozen facets in the eye of the primitive    , while the eye of the     has some 4,000, and the highly developed eye of the   may contain up to 28,000. During  , rays from a small area of the field of view fall on a single facet and are concentrated upon the rhabdom of the retinula cells below. Since each point of light differs in brightness, all the   that form the retina receive a crude mosaic of the field of view. Unlike the image in a   or in  , the mosaic image in the compound eye is not inverted but erect. The fineness of the mosaic and, therefore, the degree of   improves with increasing numbers of facets. It is estimated that the eye of the   has visual   equal to 1 percent that of humans. Each ommatidium commonly is shielded by a curtain of pigmented cells that prevent the spread of light to neighbouring ommatidia. This is called an  . In the eyes of insects that   at night or in twilight, however, the pigment can be withdrawn so that light received from neighbouring facets overlaps to some extent. This is called a  . The image formed is brighter but not as sharp as that formed by the apposition eye. In addition to perceiving brightness, the eyes of insects can perceive colour as well as some other properties of light. The most   insects known are found as   in rocks of the Middle   (393.3 million to 382.7 million years ago). The bodies of those insects were divided then, as now, into a head bearing one pair of antennae, a thorax with three pairs of legs, and a segmented abdomen. Those insects originated with the terrestrial branch of the phylum  . The Arthropoda, whose origin is thus far unknown, probably arose in  , perhaps as many as 1 billion years ago. Some arthropods colonized the open sea and have become the present-day class   (crabs, shrimps) and the now-extinct Trilobita. Other arthropods colonized the land. This   line persists chiefly as the classes Onychophora,   (spiders, scorpions, ticks), the   (consisting of   [millipedes],  ,  , and  , or centipedes), and finally the class Insecta. The most primitive insects today are found among the wingless (apterous) hexapods; sometimes known collectively as  , they include  , thysanurans,  , and collembolans. It is agreed generally that insects are related most closely to the   group, among which the Symphyla exhibit most of the essential features required for the ancestral insect form (i.e., a Y-shaped epicranial suture, two pairs of maxillae, a single pair of antennae, styli and sacs on the abdominal segments, cerci, and malpighian tubules). There is, therefore, general agreement that the insects probably arose from an early symphylan-like form.

Although movements of oxygen and carbon dioxide occur solely by gaseous   in sedentary insects, the system is ventilated mechanically in active  . Pumping movements of the abdomen provide the force necessary to drive out streams of air at some spiracles and suck them in at others. The taenidia keep the tracheae distended, thus allowing free passage of air. In addition, the most active insects have large thin-walled dilatations of the tracheae called  , which serve to increase the volume of air displaced during respiratory movements. Both   of oxygen and accumulation of carbon dioxide provide   to nerve centres that induce increased respiration during muscular activity. The reproductive system consists of the sex glands, or   (male   and female  ), the ducts through which the sexual products are carried to the exterior, and the accessory glands. The two testes are made up of a variable number of follicles in which the   mature and form packets of elongated spermatozoa. Spermatozoa, liberated in bundles with heads held in a cap of gelatinous material, accumulate in the vesicula seminalis, a dilated section of the male sexual duct (vas deferens). Each of the two ovaries consists of a number of  ovarioles. The ovarioles converge upon the two  , and the oviducts unite to form a common oviduct down which the ripe   are  . Each ovariole consists of a  germarium and a series of ovarial follicles. The germarium is a mass of undifferentiated cells that form  ,  nurse cells, and  . The nurse cells provide nourishment for the oocytes during the early stages of their growth; follicular cells, which invest the enlarging oocyte as a continuous epithelium, provide the materials for yolk formation and, in the final stages, lay down the eggshell or chorion. The ovarial follicles increase progressively in size as the oocytes grow to form ripe eggs. During  ,   of spermatozoa are sometimes introduced directly into the female vagina by means of the male copulatory organ, or  . Secretions from the accessory glands of the female activate the  , the sperm bundles disperse, and the free spermatozoa make their way up to the receptaculum seminis, or  , where they are stored, ready to fertilize the eggs. In most insects, the male accessory glands secrete materials that form a tough capsule, or  ; spermatozoa are encased in this spermatophore, which is inserted into the entrance of the vagina. The spermatophore walls commonly contain a gelatinous substance that swells upon exposure to secretions of the female and forces out the spermatozoa. The vagina serves both for receiving sperm and for laying eggs. The   segments of the abdomen of females sometimes are modified to form an   used for depositing eggs. In butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) a second copulatory canal independent of the vagina has been evolved, so that the sperm enter by one route, and the eggs are deposited by another. The  , or  , commonly provided with an air-filled meshwork, provides for respiration of the developing  . The chorion is also pierced by  , fine canals that permit entry of one or more spermatozoa for  . As the   passes down the oviduct before egg laying, the micropyles come to lie opposite the duct of the spermatheca; at this stage fertilization occurs. Eggs must be waterproof to prevent desiccation; each egg has a layer of waterproofing  , sometimes over the entire shell surface, more often lining the inside.

Hormones called   and juvenile hormones, which are not species specific, apparently regulate the changes. These physical changes as well as those involving growth and differentiation are accompanied by alterations of the organism’s physiology, biochemistry, and behaviour. The immature forms, or larvae, are adapted to   and modes of life that differ from those of the   forms. These differences may be of significance in assuring that larvae and adults of the same species do not engage in direct competition for food or living space. Examples of   include the tadpole, an aquatic larval stage that transforms into the land-dwelling frog (class Amphibia). Starfishes and other echinoderms undergo a metamorphosis that includes a change from the bilateral symmetry of the larva to the radial symmetry of the adult. Metamorphic patterns are well-known in crabs, lobsters, and other crustaceans and also in snails, clams, and other mollusks. The larval form of the   (  the tunicate, or sea squirt) is tadpole-like and free swimming; the adult is sessile and somewhat degenerate. Among the most dramatic and thoroughly studied examples of metamorphosis are the  . Because development is not the same in all insects, it is convenient to group them into major categories according to the pattern of structural changes:  , hemimetabolous, and holometabolous. In ametabolous development there is simply a gradual increase in the size of young until adult dimensions are attained. This kind of development occurs in the  , springtail, and other primitive insects. In more advanced insects (  grasshoppers, termites, true bugs) a phenomenon known as gradual, or  , metamorphosis occurs. The hemimetabolous life cycle consists of egg,  , and adult. The nymph, or immature  , resembles the adult in form and eating habits, differing in size, body proportions, and colour pattern.   wings are visible and develop externally. Development is gradual through a series of molts (periodic shedding of the outer skeleton), the adult emerging from the final molt. Complete, or  , metamorphosis is characteristic of beetles, butterflies and moths, flies, and wasps. Their life cycle includes four stages: egg,   ( ),   ( ), and adult. The larva differs greatly from the adult. It is wingless, and its form and habits are suited for growth and development rather than reproduction. The change to the adult occurs during the inactive, nonfeeding pupal stage. At this time the larva undergoes a   in which the wings appear externally, larval organs and tissues are broken down, and adult structures are developed.  , a form of complete metamorphosis, occurs in some beetles, flies, and other insects and is characterized by a series of larval stages.

					 The insect thorax consists of three segments (called the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax), which may be fused but are usually recognizable. Each segment has four groups of hard plates (sclerites); the groups are the notum (upper), the pleura (sides), and the sternum (underside). Thoracic sclerites are located on a given segment by using an appropriate prefix (pro-, meso-, meta-); for example, the notum (upper sclerite) of the prothorax is the pronotum. Each segment bears a pair of legs, and, in the mature insect, the mesothorax and metathorax typically carry a pair of wings. Each leg always consists of five parts: a coxa   to the thorax, a small trochanter, a femur, a tibia, and a tarsus with one to five segments. The tarsal segments often carry claws with adhesive pads between them (arolia or pulvilli); these enable the insect to hold onto smooth surfaces. The legs may be modified for leaping, burrowing, grasping  , or swimming in various ways. The wings at rest may be extended permanently on each side, as in some   (Odonata), or held erect above the body, as in mayflies (Ephemeroptera); in most insects, however, they are folded against the abdomen. The wing consists of cuticular sacs that bud out from the wall of the thorax; the sacs become flattened during development, and the two membranes, pressed together, are stiffened by thickenings of the   that form cylindrical veins carrying tracheae, nerves, and circulating   to all parts of the wing. Wings   for flight commonly are made of thin membranous cuticle. In some insects, notably beetles (Coleoptera), the wings of the middle segment of the thorax have become thick and horny and serve as protective sheaths (elytra) of the membranous hindwings. The locomotion of insects is effected by   acting on the external skeleton. In leaping insects (e.g., grasshoppers, fleas) the force of muscle contraction is used to compress a pad of an elastic  ,  ; when the catch mechanism is released, the   in the protein molecule is used to project the insect into the air. Insect flight is achieved by flapping the wings; during these movements the wing blade, twisted as it passes from elevation to depression, produces the same effect as the rotating propeller of an aircraft. Muscles capable of changing this   control the direction of flight. The chief flight muscles control flight in one of two ways: in dragonflies, directly on a lever at the base of each wing; but, in most insects, indirectly by deforming the shape of the thorax. The longitudinal muscles of the thorax depress the wings that are articulated with it; the vertical muscles elevate them. In butterflies, the number of wing beats per second may be as low as 8 to 12, while the rate in mosquitoes may exceed 600. These rates can exceed the frequency of contraction and relaxation of muscles responding to nerves because the muscles, after they have begun contracting and relaxing, respond to the   elastic tension in the thoracic wall, where the frequency is determined by the natural periodic oscillation of the thorax. The flight of insects, despite their small size, conforms to the   laws that regulate the flight of aircraft. The abdomen consists of a maximum of 11 segments, although this number commonly is reduced by  . Appendages are usually absent except in caterpillars, which use up to five pairs of abdominal prolegs in walking, and in   insects where the appendages at the hind end have become transformed into external genitalia. In the male these genitalia are paired claspers used to hold the female; in the female, three pairs of valvulae are used to   eggs during oviposition. In some insects, notably crickets and cockroaches, two feelers, or cerci, at the hind end of the abdomen bear sense organs. The  requirements of insects are much the same as those of  —water, inorganic ions, and essential   (i.e., those that cannot be synthesized by the animal). The requirements for preformed   and   vary with the  . Although   of the B group are needed by insects, neither vitamins A nor D are required, and many insects can synthesize ascorbic acid ( ). On the other hand, insects cannot synthesize adequate quantities of  ; thus, in effect, cholesterol can be defined as a vitamin for insects. Insects that feed solely on some restricted diet (e.g.,   blood,   juices, refined flour) have special cells called  mycetocytes that harbour   microorganisms; these organisms, transmitted through the   to the next generation, benefit their host by furnishing it with an internal source of vitamins and perhaps other essential nutrients. If the symbiotic microorganisms are removed experimentally, an insect fails to grow if not provided with a diet rich in vitamins. The digestive system consists of a   formed from the   region (stomodaeum), a   formed similarly from the anal region (proctodaeum), and a   (mesenteron). The foregut and hindgut are lined by cuticle   with that on the body surface. The mouth is followed by the muscular  , which functions in sucking and swallowing, and the  , which may be enlarged to form a  . The crop discharges into the midgut, sometimes, as in cockroaches, by way of a muscular gizzard or proventriculus. The termination of the midgut is marked by the attachment of the  , the chief organs of  . The hindgut commonly consists of a narrow ileum followed by a larger and often thick-walled  , which discharges at the  . Digestive  , secreted not only by the   but also by the cells of the midgut and its  , vary with the diet of the insect. The most important     by the salivary glands is  ; the midgut secretes several enzymes including protease,  , amylase, and invertase. The products of   are absorbed chiefly in the midgut. The hindgut receives food residues from the midgut as well as waste products from the malpighian tubules. The end products of   metabolism are  , small amounts of amino acids, and  ; in aquatic insects, ammonium salts may be a major form for nitrogen excretion. In the rectum, the epithelial cells lining the gut wall often are enlarged, particularly in restricted areas where they form rectal glands. The epithelial cells of these glands are supplied richly with tracheae and function in the reabsorption of water and  . The rectal contents of insects that inhabit dry   commonly are reduced to dry fecal pellets prior to discharge. In many insects, particularly those which feed on relatively dry foods (e.g., beetles infesting stored grain), the upper segments of the malpighian tubules are bound by a sheath to the rectal surface and form a cryptonephridial system that serves to increase the capacity of the rectum for reabsorbing water and salts. The products of digestion, discharged into the hemocoele, or general body cavity, are transported by the circulatory fluid, or  , to the organs.

The   and  , here classified as separate orders, sometimes are considered as suborders of an order Hemiptera. Both groups have piercing-sucking mouthparts; for this reason, they are thought to be closely related to each other.

The term   frequently is used to describe three closely related groups, classified here as three distinct orders: Neuroptera (lacewings), Raphidiodea (snakeflies), and Megaloptera (dobsonflies and alderflies). Although the tendency has been to classify these groups as distinct orders, they sometimes are placed in the order Neuroptera. Among the lepidopterans, members of the family   are more   than existing trichopterans (caddisflies). Although some entomologists treat them as a distinct order (Zeugloptera), others place them in the order Lepidoptera.

The medulla transmits signals between the   and the higher parts of the brain; it also controls such autonomic functions as heartbeat and respiration.

The   are separated by a deep groove, the longitudinal cerebral  . At the base of this fissure lies a thick bundle of nerve fibres, called the  , which provides a communication link between the hemispheres. The left hemisphere controls the right half of the body, and vice versa, because of a crossing of the nerve fibres in the medulla or, less commonly, in the spinal cord. Although the right and left hemispheres are mirror images of one another in many ways, there are important functional distinctions. In most people, for example, the areas that control speech are located in the left hemisphere, while areas that control   perceptions are located in the right hemisphere. Two major furrows—the   and the lateral sulcus—divide each cerebral hemisphere into four sections: the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The central sulcus, also known as the fissure of Rolando, also separates the cortical motor area (which is anterior to the fissure) from the cortical sensory area (which is posterior to the fissure). Starting from the top of the hemisphere, the upper regions of the motor and sensory areas control the lower parts of the body, and the lower regions of the motor and sensory areas control the upper parts of the body. Other functional areas of the cerebral hemispheres have been identified, including the visual cortex in the occipital lobe and the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. A large amount of the   cortex, however, is devoted to no specific motor or sensory function; this so-called association cortex is apparently involved in higher mental activities.

					 Both in complexity of behaviour and learning capacity,   wasps and bees are the equals of social wasps or honeybees. Social insects, however, have developed a   in which the members must do the work required at the proper time. If the society is to succeed, its needs must be communicated to the individual members, and those individuals must act accordingly. These needs may be met by a temporary change in the behaviour of existing individuals, or they may result in developmental changes that vary the number of individuals in the various castes (e.g., new queens, males, workers, or soldiers). Commonly, both behavioral and developmental changes are initiated by  , chemical messengers that   information from one member of a colony to another. Insect societies are gigantic families, with all individuals being the offspring of a single female. In the   the single   in the hive secretes a   known as the   (oxodecenoic acid), which is taken up by the workers and passed throughout the colony by food sharing. So long as the queen substance is present, all members are informed that the queen is healthy. If the workers are deprived of queen substance, they proceed at once to build queen cells and feed the young   with a special   known as   that results in the production of new queens. All termites and ants and some   of wasps and bees are the only insect groups containing truly social species. However, there are many other species that exhibit some lesser degree of interaction among individuals. Insects feed on every sort of organic matter, and their methods of feeding and   have become modified accordingly. The major climatic   faced by terrestrial insects are   extremes and desiccation. Different species function best at various optimal temperatures. If conditions are too hot, an insect seeks out a cool, moist, and shady spot. If exposed to the sun on a hot day, an insect will position itself so as to present the smallest amount of body surface to the heat. If conditions are too cool, insects will remain in the sun to warm themselves. Many butterflies must spread their wings and expose the large surface to the sun like solar collectors to warm the flight muscles before they can  . Many moths can raise their temperature by vibrating their wings or “shivering” before taking flight. The heat generated in this way is conserved by   or scales that maintain an insulating layer of air around the body. The optimum muscle temperature for flight is from 38 to 40 °C (100 to 104 °F). In extremely cold weather the danger for insects is freezing, and insects that survive winters in cold latitudes are called cold hardy. A few insects (e.g., some caterpillars and aquatic   larvae) tolerate   in body fluids, although it is probable that the cell contents do not freeze. In most insects, however, cold hardiness means resistance to freezing. This resistance results partly from accumulation of large quantities of   as an antifreeze and partly from physical changes in the   that permit supercooling to temperatures far below the   of water without the blood freezing. Preventing water loss is another important aspect of life in terrestrial  . All insects have a waxy ( ) layer that coats the outer surface of the   to prevent water loss from the body wall. In addition, most terrestrial insects also have   to avoid water loss through respiration and waste  . Major changes required for life in an aquatic habitat include modifications of the legs for swimming and adaptations for respiration. Most aquatic insects swim using the second or third (or both) pairs of legs. In some, the distal (away from the body) leg segments may simply be flattened and serve as oars. In others, there is a row of movable hairs on these segments that fold against the leg to offer less resistance during the forward stroke and then extend out, forming an oarlike surface during the power stroke. In some, like the water striders (Gerridae), long thin legs allow them to “walk” on the surface film of ponds and streams. To breathe, some insects simply rise to the water surface and take atmospheric air into their tracheal systems. Mosquito larvae use only the last pair of abdominal spiracles, which open at the tip of a respiratory  .   (e.g.,  ) have converted the space between the protective sheaths on the hind wings (elytra) and the   into an air-storage chamber. Air-breathing insects can prolong the period of submergence by trapping air among their surface hairs. This air film acts as a physical   and makes possible oxygen uptake from water. Other adaptations to an aquatic   have occurred in larvae that obtain all their   directly from the water. In midge larvae, abundant   (breathing tubes) contact the entire thin cuticle.   (Trichoptera) and   (Ephemeroptera) larvae have tracheal gills on the abdomen or  . In   larvae, the gills are inside the rectum, and the water is pumped in and out through the  , whereas   have external rectal gills. Insects may   some protection from the horny or leathery cuticle but may also have various chemical defenses. Some caterpillars have special irritating hairs, which break up into barbed fragments that contain a   substance that causes intense itching and serves as a protection against many  . Dermal glands of many insects discharge repellent or poisonous secretions over the cuticle, whereas others are protected by poisons that are present continuously in the blood and tissues. Such poisons often are derived from the plants on which the insects feed. In many hymenopterans (ants, bees, wasps) accessory glands in the female reproductive system have become modified to produce toxic proteins. These poisons, injected into the   of the  , paralyze it. In this state the prey serves as food for the   larva. Stings are also used by hymenopterans, including ants, wasps, and bees, for self-defense. Concealment is an important protective device for insects. For some, this may be accomplished by simply hiding beneath stones or the bark of  . However, many species rely on some forms of protective  . Protective coloration may take the form of   (cryptic coloration) in which the insect blends into its background. The coloration of many insects copies a specific background with extraordinary detail. Stick insects ( ) can change their colour to match that of the background by moving pigment granules in their epidermal cells. Some caterpillars also have patterns that develop in response to a background, although these are irreversible. Insects such as caterpillars, which rely on cryptic coloration, often combine it with a rigid deathlike position. Alternatively, insects that have well-developed chemical defenses generally show   warning (aposematic) coloration. Experiments have proved that predators such as birds quickly learn to associate such coloration “labels” with nauseous or dangerous prey. Finally, insects without nauseous qualities may gain protection by  —developing a conspicuous colour pattern similar to that found in distasteful species. The factors that limit the numbers of insect species are complex. Experimental studies of a population of grain beetles in a container of   show that the complexities increase if a second species is added. With insects in natural habitats,   not only with members of their own species but with numerous other species as well, the obstacles to survival become increasingly great. Competition among species is reduced to some extent by specialization of species to  , or habitats, for which other insects do not compete. Formerly, controversy arose over whether numbers were always density dependent (i.e., limited by the density of the species itself) or whether catastrophic actions, notably the vagaries of weather, were of prime importance. It has since become generally thought that the ultimate factor in the control of numbers is competition within the species for food and other needs. However, in many circumstances, before competition for food becomes significant, numbers are reduced by external factors. Competition within a species is often reduced by wholesale   to new localities. Migration may occur by active flight or, as in aphids and locusts, largely directed by the wind. Another important factor in the regulation of populations is balanced   of species, in which the prevalence of individuals with given characteristics changes according to the action of   as the state of the   changes. The insect is covered by the cuticle, a layer of inert material laid down by a single sheet of epidermal cells. It consists mainly of  , a carbohydrate also known as polyacetylglucosamine, and  , a hard substance composed of   tanned by  . The cuticle, which has an outer layer of waterproofing   to prevent loss of water by  , also serves as the   to which the   are attached. In insects such as caterpillars, in which the cuticle is soft and flexible, the skeleton is of the hydrostatic type. In this type, body fluid pressure, maintained by muscle   beneath the body wall, provides the firmness necessary for the function of muscles involved in movement. In insects with hard bodies, the cuticle is made up of hardened areas called   that are connected by flexible joints. At the back of the head and in the thorax, hardened ingrowths of the cuticle, known as apodemes, furnish a kind of internal skeleton for muscular attachment. Insect colours depend partly on   incorporated in the cuticle. However, the most important pigments often occur in epidermal cells below the cuticle. In butterflies and moths, pigments may be deposited in flattened hairs, or scales, covering the wings. Some of the most brilliant insect colours are not the result of pigmentation but are physical interference colours produced by fine laminae (grooves or pits) in the surface of the wing scales or the cuticle itself. The ancestors of insects most likely had bodies consisting of many similar segments with only minor aggregation of the nervous system in the   (head) segment. These primitive insect ancestors probably looked something like modern  , with a pair of appendages on each body segment but without a well-developed head. In present-day insects the primitive segments are grouped into three regions known as the head, thorax, and abdomen. The first six primitive segments have fused to form the head, and the appendages of these segments have become modified into antennae that bear numerous sense organs and   that convey food to the mouth. Eyes also are prominent on the head. In most insects the mouthparts, adapted for  , consist of several parts; behind the upper lip or labrum is a pair of hard, toothed  . These are followed by a pair of structures called first  , each consisting of a bladelike lacinia, a hoodlike galea, and a segmented palp   sense organ. The paired second maxillae are partly fused in the midline to form the lower lip, or  . Sometimes a median tonguelike structure, called the  , arises from the floor of the mouth. Insect mouthparts have been modified strikingly and reflect particular methods of feeding. The dipterans (true flies) provide instructive examples. In the primitive bloodsucking flies (e.g., the    ) the mandibles and maxillae form serrated blades that cut through the skin and   of the host  . The  epipharynx and hypopharynx are elongated and grooved so that, when apposed, they form a tube for sucking blood. The tonguelike labium is used for   exposed fluids. Dipteran mouthparts have evolved in two directions. In the   (Culicidae) the mandibles, maxillae, epipharynx, and hypopharynx have become exceedingly slender stylets that form a fine bundle and are used for piercing skin and entering blood vessels. The labium, elongated and deeply grooved, serves only as a sheath for the stylet bundle. In the    , however, mandibles and maxillae have been lost; the tonguelike labium alone remains and serves for feeding on exposed surfaces. Certain flies related to   have reacquired a capacity to suck blood; however, since they have lost both mandibles and maxillae, a new bloodsucking mechanism has developed. Labial teeth have evolved for cutting through the skin, and the labium itself is plunged into the tissues. The     has an arrangement of this kind. In the    , the labium has become a fine, needlelike structure normally protected by a sheath formed from the palps of the lost maxillae. Other mouthpart modifications of the mouthpart components provide the cutting and sucking mouthparts of fleas (Siphonaptera), plant-sucking insects (Homoptera), bloodsucking bugs (Heteroptera), honeybees (Hymenoptera), and nectar-feeding butterflies (Lepidoptera).

In terrestrial species this covering has small breathing holes (spiracles). By preventing dehydration the exoskeleton has allowed arthropods, especially insects, to invade most terrestrial habitats.

Hormones carry out their functions by evoking responses from specific   or   that are adapted to react to minute quantities of them. The classical view of hormones is that they are transmitted to their targets in the bloodstream after discharge from the glands that secrete them. This mode of discharge (directly into the bloodstream) is called    . The meaning of the term   has been extended beyond the original definition of a  -borne secretion, however, to include similar regulatory substances that are distributed by   across   membranes instead of by a blood system. Hormonal regulation is closely related to that exerted by the  , and the two processes have generally been distinguished by the rate at which each causes effects, the duration of these effects, and their extent; i.e., the effects of endocrine regulation may be slow to develop but prolonged in influence and widely distributed through the body, whereas nervous regulation is typically concerned with quick responses that are of brief duration and localized in their effects. Advances in knowledge, however, have modified these distinctions.  are secretory, for responses to the nerve impulses that they   depend upon the production of   substances, or  , such as   and   (noradrenaline), which are liberated at nerve endings in minute amounts and have only a momentary action. It has been established, however, that certain specialized nerve cells, called  , can translate neural signals into chemical stimuli by producing secretions called  . These secretions, which are often polypeptides (compounds similar to   but composed of fewer  ), pass along nerve-cell extensions, or axons, and are typically released into the bloodstream at special regions called  , where the   endings are in close contact with blood  . Once released in this way, neurohormones function in principle similar to hormones that are   in the bloodstream and are synthesized in the endocrine glands. The distinctions between neural and endocrine regulation, no longer as clear-cut as they once seemed to be, are further weakened by the fact that neurosecretory nerve endings are sometimes so close to their target cells that vascular transmission is not necessary. There is good evidence that hormonal regulation occurs by diffusion in plants and (although here the evidence is largely indirect) in lower animals (e.g., coelenterates), which lack a  . Hormones have a long evolutionary history, knowledge of which is important if their properties and functions are to be understood. Many important features of the    , for example, are present in the lampreys and hagfishes, modern representatives of the primitively jawless vertebrates ( ), and these features were presumably present in   ancestors that lived more than 500 million years ago. The evolution of the endocrine system in the more advanced vertebrates with jaws ( ) has involved both the appearance of new hormones and the further evolution of some of those already present in agnathans; in addition, extensive specialization of target organs has occurred to permit new patterns of response. The factors involved in the first appearance of the various hormones is largely a matter for conjecture, although hormones clearly are only one mechanism for chemical regulation,   forms of which are found in living things at all stages of development. Other mechanisms for chemical regulation include chemical substances (so-called organizer substances) that regulate early embryonic development and the pheromones that are released by social insects as sex attractants and regulators of the social organization. Perhaps, in some instances, chemical regulators including hormones appeared first as metabolic by-products. A few such substances are known in physiological regulation:  , for example, is involved in the regulation of the respiratory activity of which it is a product, in insects as well as in vertebrates. Substances such as carbon dioxide are called  parahormones to distinguish them from true hormones, which are specialized secretions.

					 It generally is agreed that insect   evolved as   insects gradually adopted different modes of life from those of  . The characters of larva and adult became genetically independent; in response to  , therefore, each was able to evolve independently of the other. Mouthparts, limbs, and other morphological features were modified in different directions and in higher groups. Where these differences were extreme, an intermediate pupal stage evolved to bridge the morphological gap between larva and adult. It seems quite probable that the development of metamorphosis occurred more than once during the   of insects. Insects did not evolve in a constant  . Throughout geological time there were prodigious changes in climate; in addition, evolution was continuous among all other animals and plants. Geologically the selection pressures among insects were changing continuously. At the end of the   the first   plants appeared. Insect evolution has paralleled that of the flowering plants; they have evolved together. As   (butterflies and moths),   (ants, bees, and wasps),   (true flies), and   (beetles) began to feed upon  ,  , or  , flowering plants came to rely more and more upon insects—rather than upon the wind—for transferring their  . Flowers evolved nectaries, scents, and   colours as attractants for those insects that could effect cross- . Insects likewise evolved appropriate mouthpart modifications for extracting nectar from flowers. During the Mesozoic warm-blooded animals (  and  ) first appeared; by the dawn of the  , they had become predominant among Earth’s large animals. The warm fermenting excrement and the decaying dead bodies of mammals furnished excellent nutrient media for many insect larvae, notably among the Diptera and Coleoptera. The adults in both groups found their nourishment in flowers. Some heteropterans (true bugs) and dipterans pierce the skin of birds and mammals and feed on their  . The   (sucking lice) and the   (fleas) have become so specialized for this type of parasitic existence that their relationships to other insects are not   known with certainty. Evolution is occurring among present-day insects. They exhibit a balanced genetic  ; in other words, in response to small environmental changes, one genetic form, more successful than another, will become more plentiful. Sometimes there is no visible difference between these forms, the advantage presumably lying in some physiological change. It is advantageous for a   to have a   from which favourable characters can be selected so that the species can respond to environmental changes. Changes within a species may occur progressively over a large geographical area. Such a progressive genetic change is called a cline; in some cases insects at the extremes of the cline are so unlike that they are taken as separate species and may be infertile when crossed. One well-known example of evolution in action among insects is   (accumulation of the black pigment  ); many butterflies   industrial areas have become almost black, the black forms being more tolerant of   and less conspicuous to predators. Another example of this  cline type of evolution is the development of insect strains resistant to an   that has been applied heavily in an area for several years. In many parts of the world houseflies became highly resistant to  . The class Insecta is divided into orders on the basis of the structure of the  , including eyes,  , and antennae; the  , including legs and wings; and the  , including segmentation, spiracles, and appendages (cerci, styli, furcula). The genitalia and their accessory structures, usually located in the ninth abdominal segment, are important in  . Other taxonomic   include bristles (their form and arrangement are known as chaetotaxy), sensory receptors (spines, hairs, sensilla, tympanal organs), pattern of wing venation, and position of mouthparts. In addition, type of   and form of larva and   are used to distinguish insects.

					 Most insects begin their lives as fertilized eggs. The  , or  , is commonly pierced by respiratory openings that lead to an air-filled meshwork inside the shell. For some insects (e.g.,   and  ) a batch of eggs is cemented together to form an   or ootheca. Insects may pass unfavourable seasons in the egg stage. Eggs of the     (Collembola) and of some grasshoppers (Orthoptera) pass summer   in a dry shrivelled state and resume development when moistened. Most eggs, however, retain their water although they may pass the winter in a state of arrested development, or  , usually at some early stage in embryonic development. However, dried eggs of   mosquitoes enter a state of dormancy after development is complete and quickly hatch when placed in water. The hatching of young   is achieved in several ways. Some, such as  , bite their way out of the egg. Many, such as the  , have   spines with which they cut a slit in the shell. Some insect eggs have a preformed “escape cap” that the larva pops from the shell by increasing the pressure inside the egg. Depending on the  , this may be accomplished either by swallowing air and then constricting   in the body to   pressure on the cap or by having an expandable region on the   (many   have a ptilinum) that can be extended by hydraulic (blood) pressure. After hatching, the larva continues to distend itself in this way, although the ptilinum collapses back into the body, until the   hardens. Once formed, the insect cuticle cannot grow. Growth can occur only by a series of molts ( ) during which new and larger cuticles form and old cuticles are shed. Molting makes possible large changes in body form. In the most primitive wingless insects ( ) such as the    , there is almost no change in form throughout growth to the  . These are known as   insects. Among insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), true bugs (Heteroptera), and homopterans (e.g.,  , scale insects), the general form is constant until the final  , when the larva undergoes substantial changes in body form to become a winged adult with fully developed genitalia. These insects, called hemimetabolous, are said to undergo  . The higher orders of insects, including   (butterflies and moths),   (beetles),   (ants, wasps, and bees), Diptera (true flies), and several others, are called   because larvae are totally unlike adults. These larvae undergo a series of molts with little change in form before they enter into complete  , which includes molting first into   and then into fully winged adults. Larvae, which vary considerably in shape, are classified in five forms:  eruciform (caterpillar-like),  scarabaeiform (grublike),  campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active),  elateriform (wireworm-like), and   (maggot-like). The three types of pupae are:  , with appendages more or less glued to the body;  , with the appendages free and not glued to the body; and  coarctate, which is essentially exarate but remaining covered by the cast skins (exuviae) of the next to the last larval instar (name given to the form of an insect between molts).

					 The insect   has many gaps. Among the primitive apterygotes, only the collembolans ( ) have been found as fossils in the   (about 419.2 million to 358.9 million years ago). Ten insect orders are known as fossils, mostly of Late   and   times (318 million to 251 million years ago). No fossils have yet been found from the Late Devonian (about 382.7 million to 358.9 million years ago) or Early Carboniferous (about 358.9 million to 318 million years ago) period, when the key characters of present-day insects are believed to have evolved; thus, early evolution must be inferred from the   of   insects. It has become evident that insect  , like that of other animals, was far more active at some periods than at others. There have been geological epochs of “explosive” evolution during which many new forms have appeared. Those epochs may have followed some modification or   in body function, or new developments favoured by climatic changes or evolutionary advances of other   and  . During those periods of evolutionary change, new methods of feeding and living led to   of insect   and limbs, the origin of  , and other changes. The simplified family tree shown here illustrates the presumed evolutionary history of winged insects ( ) throughout the geological periods from the Devonian to the Recent. The apterygotes, which are regarded as survivors of primitive insect stock, are omitted from the family tree. Dark lines indicate the periods during which the various orders have been found as fossils. Some lines stop at the names of orders now extinct and known only as fossils. Light lines indicate the   origin of various orders. Many insect types, traces of which have not yet been discovered, must have been produced during the explosive periods of evolution in   and Permian times. The primitive wingless insects gave rise to a paleopterous stock. Descendants of this stock included ancient fossil types that flourished in Permian times, such as the giant dragonflies or   (some of which had a wing span of more than half a metre) and the dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) and mayflies (Ephemeroptera), both of which have   with little change to the present. The primitive insect stock also gave rise to a neopterous stock, believed to include the progenitors of the remaining insect orders. The Orthoptera (grasshoppers) and the   ( ) have been found as fossils even in late Carboniferous times. The   ( , sometimes placed in the order Blattodea),   ( ), and   ( ), though doubtless of ancient origin, have not been found yet as fossils dated earlier than the   (252 million to 66 million years ago). The evolutionary radiation believed to have given rise to the orders listed above in the Middle Carboniferous Period is thought to have also produced a paraneopterous stock, which formed the base for a new evolutionary radiation during the  . Present-day derivatives of this stock evolved into the   ( ),   ( ),   or Siphunculata ( ), Thysanoptera ( ),   (true bugs), and   (e.g., aphids). Several phylogenetic lines are exopterygote—i.e., insects with simple  , some of which, such as Mallophaga and Anoplura, are secondarily wingless. The remaining orders are endopterygote (insects with complete metamorphosis). They are shown in the family tree as derivatives of an oligoneopterous stock, which gave rise to   ( ),   (ants, wasps, and bees), and   (beetles) in the Early Permian Period (298.9 million to 272.3 million years ago); the early ancestry of these orders is obscure, however, and the earliest fossils closely resemble present-day forms. One line from the evolutionary radiation at the beginning of the Permian gave rise to a mecopteroid stock, and there is good evidence that a sub-radiation of these mecopteroid orders (sometimes called the panorpoid complex) provided the origin for the present   ( ),   (true flies),   (fleas),   (caddisflies), and   (butterflies and moths). Insect wings develop as paired outgrowths from the  , stiffened by ribs, or veins, in which run tracheae. These tracheae follow a consistent pattern throughout the Pterygota, and their specific modifications (known as  ) are important in   and in estimations of the degree of relationship between groups. The basic consistency of venation suggests that wings have been evolved only once among the insects; that is, all the Pterygota arose from a single stem in the family tree. By the time fossil insects are found (toward the end of the Carboniferous), wings are developed fully. In the   the wings are held aloft above the back, as in mayflies, or held extended permanently on each side of the body, as in dragonflies. Throughout the   there is a wing-flexing mechanism (secondarily lost in butterflies) that enables the wings to be folded back to rest on the surface of the  . Winged insects must have made their appearance very early in the Carboniferous, but there is no fossil evidence to show the way they evolved. One   is that wings arose as fixed planes extending sideways from the thorax and that these planes were used, perhaps in some large leaping insect, for gliding. Later muscles developed, first to control inclination and then to move the wings in flapping flight. Another hypothesis is that wings may have originated from large thoracic    , similar to the movable tracheal gills along the abdomen of some    . Such outgrowths could have been useful to insects exposed by the drying up of a temporary aquatic habitat and might have carried them in rain-bearing winds to a new watery home. It is likely that the most primitive symphylan-like insects were terrestrial. Throughout insect evolution, however, independent   to aquatic habitats have occurred. Usually the pattern is one in which the adults leave the water and disperse. Many pterygote insects have become secondarily wingless, sometimes as single   or groups of species within large orders and sometimes as entire orders (the parasitic  , Mallophaga and Anoplura, and the fleas, Siphonaptera).

					 Insects are responsible for two major kinds of damage to growing crops. First is direct injury done to the   by the feeding insect, which eats leaves or burrows in stems,  , or roots. There are hundreds of     of this type, both in   and adults, among  , homopterans,  , coleopterans, lepidopterans, and dipterans. The second type is indirect damage in which the insect itself does little or no harm but transmits a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection into a crop. Examples include the viral diseases of sugar   and potatoes, carried from plant to plant by  . Although most insects grow and multiply in the crop they damage, certain grasshoppers are well-known exceptions. They can exist in a relatively harmless solitary phase for a number of years, during which time their numbers may increase. They then enter a   phase, forming gigantic migratory swarms, which are transported by winds or flight for hundreds or thousands of miles. These swarms may completely destroy crops in an invaded region. The   ( ) and   ( ) are two examples of this type of life cycle. Insect damage to humans and   also may be direct or indirect. Direct   injury by   is of relatively minor importance, although swarms of biting   and   often make life almost intolerable, as do   ( ) and salt-marsh mosquitoes. Persistent irritation by biting flies can cause deterioration in the health of  . Some  , in addition to depositing their eggs in carcasses, also invade the tissue of living   including humans, a condition known as  . An example of an insect that causes this condition is the   ( ) of the southern   and  . In many parts of the world, various blowflies infest the fleece and skin of  . This infestation, called  sheep-strike, causes severe economic damage. Many major human diseases are produced by microorganisms conveyed by insects, which serve as   of pathogens.   is caused by the protozoan  , which spends part of its developmental cycle in   mosquitoes.    , caused by  , is transmitted by the    .  , caused by the protozoan  , is carried by the sand fly  .   in humans and a group of cattle diseases that are widespread in Africa and known as   are caused by protozoan   transmitted by the bites of   ( ). Under nonsanitary conditions the common     can play an incidental role in the spread of human intestinal infections (e.g.,  , bacillary and amebic  ) by contamination of food. The   bacillus can be spread by deerfly bites, the bubonic   bacillus by fleas, and the epidemic   rickettsia by the louse  . Various mosquitoes spread viral diseases (e.g., several   diseases;   and   in humans and other animals). The relationships among the various organisms are complex. Malaria, for example, has a different   in almost every country in which it occurs, with different   species responsible for its spread. These same   affect the spread of sleeping sickness. Some relationships are indirect. Plague, a disease of   transmitted by   bites, is dangerous to humans only when heavy mortality among domestic   forces their infected fleas to attack people, thereby causing an outbreak of plague. Typhus, tularemia, encephalitis, and yellow fever also are maintained in   reservoirs and spread occasionally to humans. The historical objective of the entomologist was primarily to develop and introduce modifications into the   in such ways that diseases will not be spread by insects and crops will not be damaged by them. This objective has been achieved in numerous cases. For example, in many cities flies no longer play a major role in spreading intestinal infections, and land drainage, improved housing, and   use have eliminated malaria in many parts of the world. Massive outbreaks of the   in the 1860s led to the first large-scale use of   in agriculture. These highly poisonous chemicals (e.g., Paris green, lead arsenate, concentrated nicotine) were used in large quantities. The continued search for effective     led in the early 1940s to the production of  , a remarkable   that is highly toxic to most insects, nontoxic to humans in small quantities (although   effects may be severe), and long-lasting in effect. Widely used in agriculture for many years, DDT was not the perfect insecticide. It often killed parasites as effectively as the pests themselves, creating ecological imbalances that permitted new pests to develop large populations. Furthermore, resistant strains of pests appeared. The environmental longevity of many early insecticides was also found to cause significant ecological problems. Similar difficulties were encountered with many successors to DDT, such as Dieldrin and Endrin. In the course of developing effective insecticides, the primary emphases have been to reduce their potential to cause human health problems and their impact on the  .   methods of pest management have become increasingly important as the use of undesirable insecticides decreases. Biological methods include introducing pest strains that carry lethal  , flooding an area with sterile males (as was successfully done for the control of the screwworm fly), or developing new kinds of insecticide based on modifications of insects’ growth hormones. The   industry in Hawaii and the California citrus industry rely on biological control methods. Although these methods are not consistently effective, they are considered to be less harmful to the environment than are some chemicals.

Content: The   came to national prominence in the United States during the mid-1950s and continued to challenge racial segregation and discrimination through the 1960s. Many organizations, notably the  , headed by  , the  , and the  , arranged nonviolent demonstrations to call attention to specific inequalities experienced by Black people, while individuals also challenged unjust laws independently. The civil rights movement eventually achieved equal rights legislation, but not without challenges. In the late 1960s complications arose as various groups confronted the enduring economic and social consequences of past oppression. These problems persisted in subsequent decades, and the idea of real equality remained elusive well into the 21st century. Nonetheless, the intrepid supporters of the civil rights movement took some of the hardest first steps toward equality. On May 17, 1954, the   ruled in the case   that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. The decision effectively overturned the “separate but equal” ruling of   (1896), which had allowed   that mandated separate public facilities for white and Black Americans to prevail throughout the South during the first half of the 20th century. While the   ruling applied only to schools, it implied that segregation in other public facilities was unconstitutional as well. On December 1, 1955, African American civil rights activist   refused to give up her seat on a public bus to a white passenger. Her subsequent arrest initiated a sustained bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. The protest began on December 5, led by  , then a young local pastor, and was so successful that it was extended indefinitely. In the ensuing months, protestors faced threats, arrests, and termination from their jobs. Nonetheless, the boycott continued for more than a year. Finally, the   upheld a lower court’s ruling that segregated seating was unconstitutional, and the federal decision went into effect on December 20, 1956. In September 1957 nine African American students attended their first day at Little Rock Central High School, whose entire student population had until that point been white. The  , as they came to be called, encountered a large white mob and soldiers from the Arkansas National Guard, sent by Arkansas Gov.  , blocking the entrance of the school. For the next 18 days Pres.  , Gov. Faubus, and Little Rock’s mayor, Woodrow Mann, discussed the situation. The Little Rock Nine returned on September 23, but were met with violence. The students were sent home and returned on September 25, protected by U.S. soldiers. Although the students were continually harassed, eight of the nine completed the academic year. The entire confrontation drew international attention not only to civil rights in the United States but also to the struggle between federal and state power. On February 1, 1960, a group of four African American students from the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina (now North Carolina A&T State University), a historically Black college, began a sit-in movement in downtown Greensboro. After making purchases at the F.W. Woolworth department store, they sat at the “whites only” lunch counter. They were refused service and eventually asked to leave. The  , as they came to be called, however, remained seated until closing and returned the next day with about 20 other Black students. The sit-in grew in the following weeks with protestors taking every seat in the establishment and spilling out of the store. As protestors were arrested, others would take their places so that the establishment was unceasingly occupied. The protest spread to other cities, including Atlanta and Nashville. After months of protests, facilities began to desegregate throughout the country, and the Greensboro Woolworth’s started to serve African American patrons in July. On November 14, 1960, six-year-old   was escorted to her first day at the previously all-white William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans by four armed federal marshals. They were met with angry mobs shouting their disapproval, and, throughout the day, parents marched in to remove their children from the school as a protest to desegregation. Every subsequent day of that academic year Bridges was escorted to school, enduring insults and threats on her way, and then learning her lessons from her young teacher, Barbara Henry, in an otherwise empty classroom. Her bravery later inspired the Norman Rockwell painting   (1964). The   began on May 4, 1961, with a group of seven African Americans and six white people who boarded two buses bound for New Orleans. Testing the  ’s ruling on the case   v.   (1960), which extended an earlier ruling banning segregated interstate bus travel (1946) to include bus terminals and restrooms, the Freedom Riders used facilities for the opposite race as their buses made stops along the way. The group was confronted by violence in South Carolina, and, on May 14, when one bus stopped to change a slashed tire, the vehicle was firebombed and the Freedom Riders were beaten. Unable to travel farther, the original riders were replaced by a second group of 10, partly organized by the  , originating in Nashville. As riders were either arrested or beaten, more groups of Freedom Riders would take their place. On May 29 U.S. Attorney General   ordered the   to enforce bans on segregation more strictly, an edict that took effect in September. In the spring of 1963,  , and the   launched a campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, with local Pastor   and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) to undermine the city’s system of racial segregation. The campaign began on April 3, 1963, with  , economic boycotts, mass protests, and marches on City Hall. The demonstrations faced challenges from many sides, including an indifferent African American community, adversarial white and Black leaders, and a hostile commissioner of public safety, Eugene (“Bull”) Connor. On April 12 King was arrested for violating an anti-protest injunction and placed in solitary confinement. The demonstrations continued, but, after a month without any concessions, King was convinced to launch the Children’s Crusade. Beginning on May 2, 1963, school-aged volunteers skipped school and began to march. Many submitted politely to arrests, and local jails quickly filled up. On May 3 Connor ordered the police and fire department to set high-pressure water hoses and attack dogs on protesters. The violent tactics against peaceful demonstrators continued in ensuing days, causing outrage in the community, and gaining national attention. The negative media spurred Pres.   to propose a civil rights bill on June 11. Although the Birmingham campaign eventually negotiated an agreement with local reforms, tensions remained high in the city, and the meeting places of civil rights activists were continually threatened. A bomb on September 15 at   killed four African American girls and injured 14 others. The demonstrations of 1963 culminated with the   for Jobs and Freedom on August 28 to protest civil rights abuses and employment discrimination. A crowd of about 250,000 individuals gathered peacefully on the   in Washington, D.C., to listen to speeches by civil rights leaders, notably  . He addressed the crowd with an eloquent and uplifting message that famously became known as the “ ” speech. On July 2, 1964, Pres.  , signed the   into law, a stronger version of what his predecessor, President  , had proposed the previous summer before his   in November 1963. The act authorized the federal government to prevent racial discrimination in employment, voting, and the use of public facilities. Although controversial, the legislation was a victory for the civil rights movement. On February 21, 1965, the prominent Black leader   was assassinated while lecturing at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem, New York. An eloquent orator, Malcolm X spoke out on the civil rights movement, demanding it move beyond civil rights to human rights, and argued that the solution to racial problems was in orthodox Islam. His speeches and ideas contributed to the development of   ideology and the  . On March 7, 1965,  , organized a march from Selma, Alabama, to the state’s capital, Montgomery, to call for a federal voting rights law that would provide legal support for disenfranchised African Americans in the South. State troopers, however, sent marchers back with violence and tear gas, and television cameras recorded the incident. On March 9 King tried again, leading more than 2,000 marchers to the Pettus Bridge, where they encountered a barricade of state troopers. King led his followers to kneel in prayer and then he unexpectedly turned back. The media attention prompted President   to introduce voting rights legislation on March 15, and on March 21  ; this time, they were protected by Alabama National Guardsmen, federal marshals, and FBI agents. Marchers arrived in Montgomery on March 25, where King addressed the crowd with what would be called his “How Long, Not Long” speech. The   was signed into law several months later, on August 6. It suspended literacy tests, provided for federal approval of proposed changes to voting laws or procedures, and directed the attorney general of the United States to challenge the use of poll taxes for state and local elections. A series of violent confrontations between the city police and residents of Watts and other predominantly African American neighborhoods of Los Angeles began on August 11, 1965, after a white police officer arrested a Black man, Marquette Frye, on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Later accounts indicated that Frye resisted arrest but were unclear whether police had used excessive force. Violence, fires, and looting broke out over the next six days. The   resulted in 34 deaths, more than 1,000 injuries, and $40 million in property damage. The McCone Commission later investigated the causes of the riots and concluded that they were not the work of gangs or the Black Muslim movement, as the media had previously suggested. The violence was more directly a reaction to the great economic challenges that African Americans in urban centers faced: poor housing, schools, and job prospects that civil rights legislation had not improved. In the wake of the assassination of   and urban uprisings,   and   founded the   in Oakland, California, to protect African American neighborhoods from  . The   launched numerous community programs that offered such services as tuberculosis testing, legal aid, transportation assistance, and free shoes to disadvantaged people. The programs confronted the economic problems of African Americans, which the party argued the civil rights reforms did not do enough to address. The Black Panthers’ socialist viewpoint, however, made them a target of the  ’s counterintelligence program ( ), which accused them of being a communist organization and an enemy of the U.S. government. A campaign to annihilate the group came to a head in December 1969 with a police shoot-out at the group’s Southern California headquarters and the killing of   and another Panther during an Illinois state police raid. The Black Panther Party’s operations, however, continued into the 1970s, albeit less actively. On June 12, 1967, the   declared the Virginia statutes prohibiting interracial marriage unconstitutional in the case  . The case was decided nine years after Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Jeter, a woman of mixed African American and Native American ancestry, had pleaded guilty to having violated Virginia state law prohibiting a white person and a “colored” person from leaving the state to be married and returning to live as man and wife. Their one-year prison sentence was suspended on the condition that the couple leave Virginia and not return as husband and wife for 25 years. Once settled in Washington, D.C., the couple filed suit in a Virginia state court in 1963. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which reversed their conviction. Chief Justice   wrote for a unanimous court that the freedom to marry was a basic civil right and that to deny that freedom based on the groundless classifications outlined in Virginia state’s law was “to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law.” The ruling thus invalidated laws against interracial marriage in Virginia and 15 other states. A series of violent confrontations between residents of predominantly Black neighborhoods and city police in Detroit began on July 23, 1967, after a raid at an illegal drinking club where police arrested everyone inside, including 82 African Americans. Nearby residents protested, and some began to vandalize property, loot businesses, and start fires for the next five days. The   spread to other parts of the city and resulted in 43 deaths, hundreds of injuries, more than 7,000 arrests, and 1,000 burned buildings. As the disturbances continued, President   appointed a   (the Kerner Commission) to investigate recent urban uprisings. It concluded that racism, discrimination, and poverty were some of the causes of the violence and warned that “our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.” On April 4, 1968,   by a sniper while standing on the second-floor balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He had been staying at the hotel after leading a nonviolent demonstration in support of striking sanitation workers in that city. His murder set off riots in hundreds of cities across the country, and it also pushed   to pass the stalled   in King’s honor on April 11. The legislation made it unlawful for sellers, landlords, and financial institutions to refuse to rent, sell, or provide financing for a dwelling based on factors other than an individual’s financial resources. After that victory, some of King’s supporters carried on his activities, including staging the Poor People’s March in Washington, D.C., that spring. The civil rights movement, however, seemed to be shifting away from the nonviolent tactics and interracial cooperation that had brought about a number of policy changes. The changes, however, could not overcome deep-seated discrimination and the economic oppression that prevented real equality.

Hormones called   and juvenile hormones, which are not species specific, apparently regulate the changes. These physical changes as well as those involving growth and differentiation are accompanied by alterations of the organism’s physiology, biochemistry, and behaviour. The immature forms, or larvae, are adapted to   and modes of life that differ from those of the   forms. These differences may be of significance in assuring that larvae and adults of the same species do not engage in direct competition for food or living space. Examples of   include the tadpole, an aquatic larval stage that transforms into the land-dwelling frog (class Amphibia). Starfishes and other echinoderms undergo a metamorphosis that includes a change from the bilateral symmetry of the larva to the radial symmetry of the adult. Metamorphic patterns are well-known in crabs, lobsters, and other crustaceans and also in snails, clams, and other mollusks. The larval form of the   (  the tunicate, or sea squirt) is tadpole-like and free swimming; the adult is sessile and somewhat degenerate. Among the most dramatic and thoroughly studied examples of metamorphosis are the  . Because development is not the same in all insects, it is convenient to group them into major categories according to the pattern of structural changes:  , hemimetabolous, and holometabolous. In ametabolous development there is simply a gradual increase in the size of young until adult dimensions are attained. This kind of development occurs in the  , springtail, and other primitive insects. In more advanced insects (  grasshoppers, termites, true bugs) a phenomenon known as gradual, or  , metamorphosis occurs. The hemimetabolous life cycle consists of egg,  , and adult. The nymph, or immature  , resembles the adult in form and eating habits, differing in size, body proportions, and colour pattern.   wings are visible and develop externally. Development is gradual through a series of molts (periodic shedding of the outer skeleton), the adult emerging from the final molt. Complete, or  , metamorphosis is characteristic of beetles, butterflies and moths, flies, and wasps. Their life cycle includes four stages: egg,   ( ),   ( ), and adult. The larva differs greatly from the adult. It is wingless, and its form and habits are suited for growth and development rather than reproduction. The change to the adult occurs during the inactive, nonfeeding pupal stage. At this time the larva undergoes a   in which the wings appear externally, larval organs and tissues are broken down, and adult structures are developed.  , a form of complete metamorphosis, occurs in some beetles, flies, and other insects and is characterized by a series of larval stages.

Content: There’s another food revolution coming. And it isn’t a quiet one. It’s practically buzzing. And clicking. And crunching. It’s almost orchestral, really, in a tinny, droning sort of way. That’s right: an increasing number of scientists suggest that if we’re to support our booming population in the coming decades, we must turn to new sources of protein, namely, in the form of insects. If the leaps in grain production in the late 1960s—attributable to genetic engineering and improved agricultural techniques—constituted a Green Revolution, this is a protein revolution. It’s not going to go down easy, not in the Western world at least. Though residents of equatorial countries have long availed themselves of the protein-rich flesh of insects, Westerners usually still find their gorges rising at the thought of ingesting a single bug, let alone a risotto studded with them. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) wants to find ways around this squeamishness. In doing so, it turned to a cadre of entomologists, food scientists, and other experts, who issued a report on the subject in 2013. Notably, the report emphasized that raising insects for food uses substantially fewer resources than raising large vertebrate livestock. The lead author, entomologist Arnold van Huis, says, “Crickets, grasshoppers and locusts are my favorites, in particular when they are nicely cooked and seasoned. Deep-fried, they can also become nicely crunchy.” What is the name for an insect’s egg-laying organ? How many known species of insects are there? You may...

Two of the most important domesticated insects are the   (Lepidoptera) and the   (Hymenoptera). Some coarse silks are produced from the   of large wild silkworm  . Most commercial silks, however, come from the silkworm  . This insect is unknown in the wild state and exists only in  . It was domesticated in   thousands of years ago, and  , notably in China and Japan, has produced many specialized strains. The honeybee is a close relative of existing wild  .

When insects that break down dead trees invade structural timbers in buildings, they become  . This is true of insects such as   and various   that ecologically are latecomers to   and are capable of breaking down the   in hair and feathers. When these insects invade skins, furs, and wool garments or carpets, they can become problems for humans. In many hot, dry climates, as in   or the plains of India, ripened   in the fields is invaded by certain beetles and moths. When the grain is harvested, these insects thrive in the grain stores. They can be carried throughout the world in commerce and have become universal pests of stored grain, dried fruit,  , and other products.   and disinfestation methods are used to control importation of such insects from grain-exporting countries. Many insects are   feeders, and, when the plants are of agricultural importance, humans are often forced to compete with these insects. Populations of insects are limited by such factors as unfavourable  , predators and  , and viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases, as well as many other factors that operate to make insect populations stable.   that encourage the planting of ever larger areas to single crops, which provides virtually unlimited food resources, has removed some of these regulating factors and allowed the rate of   of insects that attack those crops to increase. This increases the probability of great infestations of certain insect pests. Many natural forests, which form similar giant monocultures, always seem to have been subject to periodic outbreaks of destructive insects. In some agricultural monocultures, nonnative insect pests have been accidentally introduced along with a crop but without also bringing along its full range of natural enemies. This has occurred in the   with the   ( ) of apple and other fruit trees, the   ( ) of citrus, the   ( ; also called  ), and others. The   ( ), which caused appalling destruction to the     in the United States beginning about 1840, was a native insect of semidesert country. The beetle, which fed on the buffalo burr plant, adapted itself to a newly introduced and abundant diet of potatoes and thus escaped from all previous controlling factors. Similar situations often have been controlled by determining the major predators or parasites of an alien insect   in its country of origin and introducing them as control agents. A classic example is the cottony-cushion scale, which threatened the California citrus industry in 1886. A predatory  , the   ( ), was introduced from  , and within a year or two the   had virtually disappeared. The success was repeated in every country where the scale insect had become established without its predators. In eastern Canada in the early 1940s the European  spruce sawfly ( ), which had caused   damage, was completely controlled by the spontaneous appearance of a   disease, perhaps unknowingly introduced from Europe. This event led to increased interest in using insect diseases as potential means of managing pest populations.

					 The   consists of a series of   that supply nerves to successive segments of the body. The three main ganglia in the   (protocerebrum, deutocerebrum, and tritocerebrum) commonly are fused to form the  , or supraesophageal ganglion. The rest of the ganglionic chain lies below the   against the ventral body surface. The brain is joined by paired connectives to the subesophageal ganglion, which is linked in turn by paired connectives to the three thoracic and eight abdominal ganglia (numbered according to segment). In most insects the number of separate ganglia has been reduced by  . The last abdominal ganglion always serves several segments. In homopterans and heteropterans all the abdominal ganglia usually fuse with mesothoracic and metathoracic ganglia; and in the   of higher flies (Cyclorrhapha), the ganglia of the brain,  , and   form one mass. Each ganglion is made up of   bodies that lie on the   and a mass of nerve fibres, the neuropile, that occupies the centre. There are two types of nerve cells,   and  association neurons. Motor neurons have main processes, or  , that extend from the ganglia to contractile muscles, and minor processes, or  , that connect with the  . Association neurons, usually smaller than motor neurons, are linked with other parts of the   by way of the neuropile. Cell bodies of the sense organs, called  , lie at the periphery of the body just below the  . Sensory neurons occur as single cells or small   of cells; the distal process, or dendrite, of each cell extends to a cuticular sense organ ( ). The sensilla are usually small hairs modified for perception of specific stimuli (e.g., touch, smell, taste, heat, cold); each sensillum consists of one sense cell and one  . Although these small sense organs occur all over the body, they are particularly abundant in  , palps, and cerci. The sense cell of each sensillum gives off a proximal process, or sensory axon, which runs inward to the central nervous system, where it enters the neuropile and makes contact with the endings of association neurons. Bundles of both sensory axons and motor axons, which are enclosed in protective membranous sheaths,   the nerves.    may be sensitive enough to perceive air vibrations and thus serve as organs for  . Tympanal organs (eardrums) are present in certain butterflies and grasshoppers. Mechanical sensilla (chordotonal organs) below the surface of the cuticle serve for perception of internal strains and body movements. The eyes are of two kinds, simple eyes, or  , and  . In the adults of higher insects both types are present. The visual sense cells are derived from the epidermis, as are those of other sense organs, and are connected to the optic ganglia (a part of the brain) by sensory axons. Each visual sense cell has a zone at its surface, which, on exposure to  , gives rise to chemical products that stimulate the sense cell, called the  retinula cell, and initiate the nerve impulse in the sensory axon. The light-receptive zone, or  , of the retinula cell commonly has a rodlike form; because it lies perpendicular to the surface, light passes lengthwise along it. In the simple eyes (ocelli) a lens-shaped area of cuticle lies over the group of retinula cells that form the  . Since the optical structure is primitive, the visual image received is crude; ocelli can perceive only light, darkness, and movement. The   eye, made up of a number of facets, resembles a honeycomb; each facet overlies a group of six or seven retinal cells that surround the rhabdom. Each of the retinal units below a single facet is termed an ommatidium. The number of facets varies. For example, there are only a few dozen facets in the eye of the primitive    , while the eye of the     has some 4,000, and the highly developed eye of the   may contain up to 28,000. During  , rays from a small area of the field of view fall on a single facet and are concentrated upon the rhabdom of the retinula cells below. Since each point of light differs in brightness, all the   that form the retina receive a crude mosaic of the field of view. Unlike the image in a   or in  , the mosaic image in the compound eye is not inverted but erect. The fineness of the mosaic and, therefore, the degree of   improves with increasing numbers of facets. It is estimated that the eye of the   has visual   equal to 1 percent that of humans. Each ommatidium commonly is shielded by a curtain of pigmented cells that prevent the spread of light to neighbouring ommatidia. This is called an  . In the eyes of insects that   at night or in twilight, however, the pigment can be withdrawn so that light received from neighbouring facets overlaps to some extent. This is called a  . The image formed is brighter but not as sharp as that formed by the apposition eye. In addition to perceiving brightness, the eyes of insects can perceive colour as well as some other properties of light. The most   insects known are found as   in rocks of the Middle   (393.3 million to 382.7 million years ago). The bodies of those insects were divided then, as now, into a head bearing one pair of antennae, a thorax with three pairs of legs, and a segmented abdomen. Those insects originated with the terrestrial branch of the phylum  . The Arthropoda, whose origin is thus far unknown, probably arose in  , perhaps as many as 1 billion years ago. Some arthropods colonized the open sea and have become the present-day class   (crabs, shrimps) and the now-extinct Trilobita. Other arthropods colonized the land. This   line persists chiefly as the classes Onychophora,   (spiders, scorpions, ticks), the   (consisting of   [millipedes],  ,  , and  , or centipedes), and finally the class Insecta. The most primitive insects today are found among the wingless (apterous) hexapods; sometimes known collectively as  , they include  , thysanurans,  , and collembolans. It is agreed generally that insects are related most closely to the   group, among which the Symphyla exhibit most of the essential features required for the ancestral insect form (i.e., a Y-shaped epicranial suture, two pairs of maxillae, a single pair of antennae, styli and sacs on the abdominal segments, cerci, and malpighian tubules). There is, therefore, general agreement that the insects probably arose from an early symphylan-like form.

					 Scientists familiar with insects realize the difficulty in attempting to estimate individual numbers of insects beyond areas of a few acres or a few square miles in extent. Figures soon become so large as to be incomprehensible. The large populations and great variety of insects are related to their small size, high rates of reproduction, and   of suitable food supplies. Insects abound in the tropics, both in numbers of different kinds and in numbers of individuals. If the insects (including the young and adults of all forms) are counted on a square yard (0.84 square metre) of rich moist surface soil, 500 are found easily and 2,000 are not unusual in soil samples in the north temperate zone. This amounts to roughly 4 million insects on one moist acre (0.41 hectare). In such an area only an occasional  ,  , or large  , supergiants among insects, probably would be noticed. Only a few thousand  , those that attack people’s crops, herds, and products and those that carry disease, interfere with   life seriously enough to require control measures. Insects are adapted to every land and freshwater habitat where food is available, from   to  , from glacial fields and cold mountain streams to  , lowland ponds and  . Many live in brackish water up to   the salinity of seawater, a few live on the surface of seawater, and some     can live in pools of crude  , where they eat other insects that fall in. Insects play many important roles in nature. They aid  ,  , and other organisms in the decomposition of organic matter and in soil formation. The decay of carrion, for example, brought about mainly by bacteria, is accelerated by the   of   and  . The activities of these larvae, which distribute and consume bacteria, are followed by those of moths and beetles, which break down hair and feathers. Insects and   have evolved together. Many plants depend on insects for  . Some insects are predators of others.

Hormones carry out their functions by evoking responses from specific   or   that are adapted to react to minute quantities of them. The classical view of hormones is that they are transmitted to their targets in the bloodstream after discharge from the glands that secrete them. This mode of discharge (directly into the bloodstream) is called    . The meaning of the term   has been extended beyond the original definition of a  -borne secretion, however, to include similar regulatory substances that are distributed by   across   membranes instead of by a blood system. Hormonal regulation is closely related to that exerted by the  , and the two processes have generally been distinguished by the rate at which each causes effects, the duration of these effects, and their extent; i.e., the effects of endocrine regulation may be slow to develop but prolonged in influence and widely distributed through the body, whereas nervous regulation is typically concerned with quick responses that are of brief duration and localized in their effects. Advances in knowledge, however, have modified these distinctions.  are secretory, for responses to the nerve impulses that they   depend upon the production of   substances, or  , such as   and   (noradrenaline), which are liberated at nerve endings in minute amounts and have only a momentary action. It has been established, however, that certain specialized nerve cells, called  , can translate neural signals into chemical stimuli by producing secretions called  . These secretions, which are often polypeptides (compounds similar to   but composed of fewer  ), pass along nerve-cell extensions, or axons, and are typically released into the bloodstream at special regions called  , where the   endings are in close contact with blood  . Once released in this way, neurohormones function in principle similar to hormones that are   in the bloodstream and are synthesized in the endocrine glands. The distinctions between neural and endocrine regulation, no longer as clear-cut as they once seemed to be, are further weakened by the fact that neurosecretory nerve endings are sometimes so close to their target cells that vascular transmission is not necessary. There is good evidence that hormonal regulation occurs by diffusion in plants and (although here the evidence is largely indirect) in lower animals (e.g., coelenterates), which lack a  . Hormones have a long evolutionary history, knowledge of which is important if their properties and functions are to be understood. Many important features of the    , for example, are present in the lampreys and hagfishes, modern representatives of the primitively jawless vertebrates ( ), and these features were presumably present in   ancestors that lived more than 500 million years ago. The evolution of the endocrine system in the more advanced vertebrates with jaws ( ) has involved both the appearance of new hormones and the further evolution of some of those already present in agnathans; in addition, extensive specialization of target organs has occurred to permit new patterns of response. The factors involved in the first appearance of the various hormones is largely a matter for conjecture, although hormones clearly are only one mechanism for chemical regulation,   forms of which are found in living things at all stages of development. Other mechanisms for chemical regulation include chemical substances (so-called organizer substances) that regulate early embryonic development and the pheromones that are released by social insects as sex attractants and regulators of the social organization. Perhaps, in some instances, chemical regulators including hormones appeared first as metabolic by-products. A few such substances are known in physiological regulation:  , for example, is involved in the regulation of the respiratory activity of which it is a product, in insects as well as in vertebrates. Substances such as carbon dioxide are called  parahormones to distinguish them from true hormones, which are specialized secretions.

					 The   is an open one, with most of the body fluid, or hemolymph, occupying cavities of the body and its appendages. The one closed organ, called the dorsal  , extends from the hind end through the   to the head; it is a continuous tube with two regions, the   or pumping organ, which is restricted to the  , and the  , or conducting vessel, which extends forward through the thorax to the  . Hemolymph, pumped forward from the hind end and the sides of the body along the dorsal vessel, passes through a series of valved chambers, each containing a pair of lateral openings called  , to the aorta and is discharged in the front of the head. Accessory pumps carry the hemolymph through the wings and along the   and legs before it flows backward again to the abdomen. The circulating hemolymph, or  , is not important in respiration but functions in transporting nutrients to all parts of the body and metabolic waste products from the organs to the malpighian tubules for  . It contains free cells called hemocytes, most of which are phagocytes that help to protect the insect by devouring microorganisms. An important tissue bathed by the hemolymph is the  fat body, the main organ of intermediary metabolism. It serves for the storage of  ,  , and  , particularly during  . These materials are set free as required by the tissues for energy production or for growth and reproduction. The   consists of air-filled tubes or  tracheae, which open at the surface of the thorax and abdomen through paired  . The muscular valves of the spiracles, closed most of the time, open only to allow the uptake of   and the escape of  . The tracheal tubes are   with the   of the body surface. The tracheae are stiffened by spiral thickenings or threadlike ridges called taenidia, which branch repeatedly, becoming reduced in   and ending in fine thin-walled  tracheoles less than one micron in diameter. The tracheoles insinuate themselves between cells, sometimes appearing to penetrate into them, and push deeply into the  . Although movements of oxygen and carbon dioxide occur solely by gaseous   in sedentary insects, the system is ventilated mechanically in active  . Pumping movements of the abdomen provide the force necessary to drive out streams of air at some spiracles and suck them in at others. The taenidia keep the tracheae distended, thus allowing free passage of air. In addition, the most active insects have large thin-walled dilatations of the tracheae called  , which serve to increase the volume of air displaced during respiratory movements. Both   of oxygen and accumulation of carbon dioxide provide   to nerve centres that induce increased respiration during muscular activity. The reproductive system consists of the sex glands, or   (male   and female  ), the ducts through which the sexual products are carried to the exterior, and the accessory glands. The two testes are made up of a variable number of follicles in which the   mature and form packets of elongated spermatozoa. Spermatozoa, liberated in bundles with heads held in a cap of gelatinous material, accumulate in the vesicula seminalis, a dilated section of the male sexual duct (vas deferens). Each of the two ovaries consists of a number of  ovarioles. The ovarioles converge upon the two  , and the oviducts unite to form a common oviduct down which the ripe   are  . Each ovariole consists of a  germarium and a series of ovarial follicles. The germarium is a mass of undifferentiated cells that form  ,  nurse cells, and  . The nurse cells provide nourishment for the oocytes during the early stages of their growth; follicular cells, which invest the enlarging oocyte as a continuous epithelium, provide the materials for yolk formation and, in the final stages, lay down the eggshell or chorion. The ovarial follicles increase progressively in size as the oocytes grow to form ripe eggs. During  ,   of spermatozoa are sometimes introduced directly into the female vagina by means of the male copulatory organ, or  . Secretions from the accessory glands of the female activate the  , the sperm bundles disperse, and the free spermatozoa make their way up to the receptaculum seminis, or  , where they are stored, ready to fertilize the eggs. In most insects, the male accessory glands secrete materials that form a tough capsule, or  ; spermatozoa are encased in this spermatophore, which is inserted into the entrance of the vagina. The spermatophore walls commonly contain a gelatinous substance that swells upon exposure to secretions of the female and forces out the spermatozoa. The vagina serves both for receiving sperm and for laying eggs. The   segments of the abdomen of females sometimes are modified to form an   used for depositing eggs. In butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) a second copulatory canal independent of the vagina has been evolved, so that the sperm enter by one route, and the eggs are deposited by another. The  , or  , commonly provided with an air-filled meshwork, provides for respiration of the developing  . The chorion is also pierced by  , fine canals that permit entry of one or more spermatozoa for  . As the   passes down the oviduct before egg laying, the micropyles come to lie opposite the duct of the spermatheca; at this stage fertilization occurs. Eggs must be waterproof to prevent desiccation; each egg has a layer of waterproofing  , sometimes over the entire shell surface, more often lining the inside.

In fact,   was the very name of  ’s 2014 documentary about our two contests. I defeated Deep Blue (4–2) in our first face-off in 1996. When the computer defeated me in the first of our six games, it marked the first time a machine had won a game against a world champion under classical tournament conditions. When the computer beat me in the decisive sixth game of our 1997 rematch, its 3.5–2.5 victory (winning two games, with three draws) marked the first time a computer had ever won a classical   against a world champion. When I lost the rematch, it was hailed by many as a momentous occasion for human progress on par with the Moon landing. I didn’t feel so enthusiastic about it myself, but I realized that while the era of intelligent machines was ending in  , it was only getting started in every other aspect of our lives. Real life—language, business, education, health—doesn’t have a tidy framework like chess. Artificial intelligence (AI) today begins with a huge amount of data and clever algorithms to analyze it, without strict pre-existing rules. Machine learning is pushing the frontier of what machines can do better than humans—medical diagnosis, legal research—and how it does it has limitless potential. This type of AI doesn’t care   something works,   it works. These machines even teach themselves better ways to learn, effectively coding themselves iteratively. Chess, still an AI bellwether, demonstrated this principle in astonishing fashion in late 2017, when the machine-learning algorithm   taught itself to play better than any existing program or human after four hours of playing against itself. Think about all the new ways of solving problems based on objective results instead of centuries of accumulated human dogma. This is a brave new world, one in which machines are doing things humans do not know how to teach them to do, one in which machines figure out the rules—and, if we are lucky, explain them to us. If this sounds threatening instead of amazing, you’ve been watching too many dystopian Hollywood movies. Humans will still set the goals and establish the priorities. We must ensure that our agnostic machines represent the best of our human morality. If we succeed, our new tools will make us smarter, enabling us to better understand our world and ourselves. Our real challenge is to avoid complacency, to keep thinking up new directions for AI to explore. And that’s one job that can never be done by a machine. One very real area of concern, however, is the political polarization of the world. Since I retired from professional chess, much of my life has been divided between   activism and investigations into human and machine  , and we are at a critical inflection point in both areas. The global rise of   threatens to roll back a half-century of democratic proliferation that was capped by the fall of the   in 1989 and the collapse of the   two years later. Today, freedom is under assault from all sides—geographically from the Americas to Europe to Asia, politically from both right and left, in regimes that have relatively little experience with democracy and in several of the world’s freest states. The political center is being hollowed out, with extremist positions leading to backlash and whiplash. Over half the world’s population lives under nondemocratic regimes today. Even more troubling, that percentage has been rising. Autocratic regimes like my native Russia have become full-blown dictatorships. A tide of illiberal nationalism is rising in eastern Europe, just one generation removed from life behind the  . Traditional defenders of the values of openness and liberty, the United Kingdom and the United States, were dealt shocking election results by the forces of isolation and nativism. If this trend against freedom is not combated and reversed, the world is headed into a new era of conflict between great powers, with all the human suffering that would entail. The free world is still ascendant—economically, politically, militarily—but if there is no will to leverage that power to make the world freer and safer for all, that   will continue to wane.

Content: Oh no, it’s a bug! There are many different kinds of insects in many different shapes and sizes. Some frighten people, while others delight them. And some play an important role in helping people get healthy. This list will help you gain a greater understanding of bugs.  The Handy Answer Book for Kids (and Parents)   are small creatures with three pairs of legs, a body with three main parts (a head, thorax, and abdomen), and a tough shell-like outer covering, called an exoskeleton. Insects are  , which means they do not have a backbone. Most have one or two pairs of wings and a pair of antennae. There are about 1,000,000 known species of insects in the world, and entomologists (scientists who study bugs) estimate that there are millions (perhaps up to 10 million!) more yet to be discovered. Insects are everywhere—there are more bugs in 1 square mile (about 2.6 sq km) of rural land than there are human beings on the entire globe. Insects are divided into 32 orders, or groups. The largest insect order is the beetles ( ) with 200 different families and approximately 400,000 different species. In fact, one out of every four animals on Earth is some type of beetle. In the United States, there are some 73,000 species of insects: approximately 24,000 beetles, 19,500  , 17,500  ,  , and  , and 11,500   and  .  grow through the process of  , meaning that they undergo change. Insect groups that undergo a complete metamorphosis include beetles, moths, butterflies, sawflies, wasps, ants, bees, and flies. All these groups begin their   as an  . The egg hatches into a  —such as a caterpillar, grub, or maggot—that feeds, molts (sheds its skin), and grows larger. The larva goes through an inactive   stage—for example, it is wrapped up in a cocoon—and emerges as an adult insect, such as a butterfly or beetle, that looks very different from the larva it once was.  Other insect groups do not go through a complete metamorphosis; instead, they experience gradual changes as they turn into adults. These include scales, aphids, cicadas, leafhoppers, true bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, praying mantises, cockroaches, earwigs, and dragonflies. Immature forms of these insects are called nymphs. The   grow and gradually change size, shedding their skin along the way. After a final molt, the full adult form emerges.  and other   fly from one plant to the next so as to feed on the sweet  —and sometimes the  —located in the interior of  . The sugar in nectar supplies insects with the energy they need, and pollen contains protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals. In the process of feeding, many insects transfer pollen—which sticks to their bodies—from one plant’s flower to another.  Pollen, which is a fine powdery grain from a flower’s male reproductive organ, must be transferred to the female reproductive organ of a flower for fertilization to take place and seeds to form. Most adult  , including   and  , have two large  , made up of separate lenses. Sometimes these eyes have thousands of lenses. They all point in different directions to give the insect a very wide field of vision. The lenses also help the insect see movement, enabling it to react quickly to seize its prey or escape danger. You can witness this yourself as you try to swat a fly in your home—it’s very difficult to catch a flying insect! The large round spots on the wings of   and  , which look like big round eyes, are a defense mechanism. When a bird or other animal tries to eat the insect, the insect opens its wings and begins to fly off. The wing movement reveals the moth’s “eyes,” confusing the insect’s enemy by  . The predator hesitates, and the insect is able to escape. Yes.   are   that live in colonies, or underground chambers, which may house as many as 500,000 individuals. Ant chambers are connected to each other and to the surface of the earth by small tunnels. There are rooms for food storage, rooms for mating, and nurseries for the young. A queen produces eggs to supply new ants for the colony. The colony is built and maintained by legions of worker ants, who carry tiny bits of dirt in their mandibles (a pair of appendages near the insect’s mouth) and deposit them near the exit of the colony, forming an ant hill.  While most ant colonies are self-sufficient, Amazon ants, which are aggressive red ants (genus  ) found in the western U.S., steal the   of other ants so as to use them as workers—to build homes for and feed the Amazon ants, who do nothing but fight. They depend completely on these “enslaved” ants for survival. That depends on what you mean by the word  . The   often cited as the   is   (also classified as  ), which lives in western  . These insects can be 22 inches (56 cm) long! They are related to the group of insects called walkingsticks.   get their name from the fact that they do, indeed, look like sticks with legs. The largest walkingsticks can grow to up to 13 inches (33 centimeters) in length. There are approximately 3,000 tropical species of walkingsticks, and 10 species that live in North America. One species,  , is the longest insect in the United States, reaching 7 inches (17.7 cm) in length. If you are talking about the   insect, then take a look at the giant weta ( ), an   insect that can weigh up to two and a half ounces (71 g). These insects may look ferocious and scary because of their size, but they are actually harmless. Another insect that is often considered the biggest is the Actaeon beetle ( ) because it is very bulky looking and can be as big as 3.5 inches (9 cm) long by 2 inches (5 cm) wide and 1.5 inches (4 cm) thick. The  , also called a praying mantid, is a large flesh-eating insect that lives in warm areas of the world. Mantis species from Europe and China were introduced to the northeastern United States many decades ago for use as pest exterminators on farms and in gardens. These   insects—sometimes called “vicious predators”—are among the few insects that can rotate their heads to look over their shoulders, making them extremely effective hunters. They pose in a deceptively humble posture when searching for food, as if their front legs are folded in prayer. Mantises grab their victims with their raptorial front legs, which quickly shoot out from their bodies. Mantises almost always start eating their catch while it is alive, and they often start eating their victim’s neck to quickly end the struggle.  Praying mantises eat a variety of insects—other mantises, beetles, butterflies,  ,  —and  . They also eat small  ,  ,  ,  , and other nesting birds. Because they keep down the populations of “bad bugs” that threaten farms, they are highly useful to agricultural workers. Many people think of   as insects, but actually they are classified in a separate category. Spiders are part of a group called  , which also includes  ,  , and  . Arachnids share many features with their arthropod cousins, but they differ in that they do not have antennae. Spiders also have eight legs (insects have six), and spiders’ bodies are segmented into two parts (insects’ bodies have three parts). Both   and   maggots are used occasionally in the field of medicine. The U.S. federal government’s   considers both bugs “approved medical devices,” the first live animals to be called that name. Blow fly maggots are used to eat dead tissue, thus helping to kill  , clean open wounds, and stimulate healing. Leeches   from the body, and their saliva contains a powerful blood thinner. Thousands of laboratory-grown maggots are delivered to hospitals across the United States every week.

Content: Ask a summertime picnicker what their biggest annoyance is, and the answer will likely be “bees.” Landing on uncovered food and drink with impunity, these insects aren’t particularly inclined to leave once they’ve tasted the ambrosial offerings that constitute the average picnic. If irate diners press the issue by brandishing paper plates and rolled newspapers, they won’t hesitate to defend their newfound bounty with a sting. Or four. That latter ability is perhaps the most-acute indication that the prime suspects in a typical picnic raid are not bees at all. In all likelihood, the culprits are actually close cousins to the bees: wasps.   (assuming that they aren’t crushed by their outraged victims). Even the most-uninterested observer can distinguish them in ways that don’t involve being pumped full of venom, though. While the bees and wasps constitute some 20,000 species each—both groups belong to the order Hymenoptera, which also contains ants—the insects most likely to be conflated are honeybees ( ) and any of several representatives of the wasp genera   (commonly known as yellow jackets). If you take a look at the insects, you can see what causes the confusion. Both yellow jackets and honeybees are somewhat bullet-shaped striped insects with wings. (Bees are thought by some entomologists to have evolved from predatory wasps.) However, closer examination of both their appearances and their behavior reveals some key differences. (Adult yellow jackets subsist on nectar and other sources of sugars. They hunt animal food only to nourish their squirmy white little sisters, which in return secrete a nourishing fluid.) Yellow jackets exhibit further adaptations to their raiding ways: aerodynamic and nipped at the waist, they are perfectly suited to taking down other insects or darting in to grab their share of whatever carrion and waste is on offer. Honeybees, in contrast, have no need of such exacting maneuverability as they bop from flower to flower; this is reflected in their more-rounded form, their bodies not tapering to the fighter-jet points of the yellow jacket. So, too, it is reflected in their neighborly absence from your outdoor repast; the human palate craves victuals totally unappetizing to bees. The next time, then, that one of your lunch companions bolts from the picnic table sounding the bee alarm, you might advise him or her as to the true identity of the culprit. And then, once the spread has been safely sealed from prying insects, perhaps invite your companions for a stroll and, along with the real bees, stop and enjoy the flowers.

Biotechnology is the use of   to solve problems and make useful products. The most prominent approach used is genetic engineering, which enables scientists to tailor an organism’s   at will. Biotechnology is particularly important in the field of medicine, where it facilitates the production of therapeutic proteins and other drugs. Synthetic   and synthetic   and diagnostic tests to detect various diseases are just some examples of how biotechnology is impacting medicine. Biotechnology has also proved helpful in refining industrial processes, in environmental cleanup, and in agricultural production. The first molecular and cellular tools of modern biotechnology emerged in the 1960s and ’70s. A fledgling “biotech”   began to coalesce in the mid- to late 1970s. Modern biotechnology stands in contrast to older forms of “biotechnology,” which emerged thousands of years ago, when humans began to domesticate plants and animals. Humans have also long tapped the biological processes of microorganisms to make bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese. ,  the use of   to solve problems and make useful products. The most prominent area of biotechnology is the production of therapeutic proteins and other drugs through  . People have been harnessing biological processes to improve their   for some 10,000 years, beginning with the first agricultural  . Approximately 6,000 years ago, humans began to tap the biological processes of microorganisms in order to make bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese and to preserve dairy products. But such processes are not what is meant today by  , a term first widely applied to the molecular and cellular technologies that began to emerge in the 1960s and ’70s. A fledgling “biotech”   began to coalesce in the mid- to late 1970s, led by  , a   company established in 1976 by Robert A. Swanson and Herbert W. Boyer to commercialize the   pioneered by Boyer,  , and Stanley N. Cohen. Early companies such as Genentech, Amgen, Biogen, Cetus, and Genex began by   genetically engineered substances primarily for medical and environmental uses. For more than a decade, the biotechnology industry was dominated by      , or  . This technique consists of splicing the   for a useful   (often a human protein) into  production cells—such as yeast,  , or mammalian cells in culture—which then begin to produce the protein in volume. In the process of splicing a gene into a production  , a new organism is created. At first, biotechnology investors and researchers were uncertain about whether the courts would permit them to     on organisms; after all, patents were not allowed on new organisms that happened to be discovered and identified in nature. But, in 1980, the  , in the case of   v.  , resolved the matter by ruling that “a live human-made microorganism is patentable subject matter.” This decision spawned a wave of new biotechnology firms and the infant industry’s first investment boom. In 1982 recombinant   became the first product made through genetic engineering to secure approval from the U.S.   (FDA). Since then, dozens of genetically engineered protein medications have been commercialized around the world, including recombinant versions of  , clotting factors, proteins for   the production of red and white blood cells,  s, and clot-dissolving agents. In the early years, the main achievement of biotechnology was the ability to produce naturally occurring therapeutic molecules in larger quantities than could be derived from conventional sources such as  , animal organs, and human cadavers. Recombinant proteins are also less likely to be contaminated with pathogens or to provoke allergic reactions. Today, biotechnology researchers seek to discover the root molecular causes of disease and to intervene precisely at that level. Sometimes this means producing therapeutic proteins that augment the body’s own supplies or that make up for genetic deficiencies, as in the first generation of biotech medications. (Gene therapy—insertion of genes   a needed protein into a patient’s body or cells—is a related approach.) The biotechnology industry has also expanded its research into the development of traditional   and   that stop the progress of a disease. Successful production of monoclonal antibodies was one of the most important techniques of biotechnology to emerge during the last quarter of the 20th century. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies and their availability in quantity have made it possible to devise sensitive assays for an enormous range of biologically important substances and to distinguish cells from one another by identifying previously unknown marker molecules on their surfaces. Such advances were made possible through the study of genes ( ), the proteins that they   (proteomics), and the larger biological pathways in which they act.

Content: Success consists of going from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm. So goes the aphorism attributed (probably wrongly) to Winston Churchill. Whatever the provenance of the quote, these organisms have taken the message to heart. They’ve surmounted disease, starvation, predation, and human intervention to become the most populous species of their respective taxonomic categories, evincing an unwavering enthusiasm for reproduction and a terrifying degree of fecundity. Of course, it is impossible to obtain exact population counts for many creatures, especially those with secretive or nocturnal lifestyles or those that are almost ubiquituous. So, some of these are merely inferences based on the breadth of a particular species’ range or on other extrapolations from the best available information. I’ve ignored invasive species, and, especially, domesticated species, some of which number well into the billions. It hardly comes as a surprise that ants are the most numerous insect in the world. These colonial hymenopterans may number from 10-100,000 trillion individuals globally; there are more than 10,000 species. The springtails, or Collembola, used to hold the title, but they are no longer officially insects, but rather part of a larger subphylum that includes insects and several related creatures. Though a few species are considered pests, ants are hugely benefical in most environments, spreading seeds and disposing of detritus as they forage for food. The copepods, in addition to being the world’s most numerous crustacean, may also in fact be the world’s most populous multi-celled organism. Found in fresh and salt water worldwide, the roughly 12,000 species are key participants in all of the ecosystems they inhabit. Most are vase-shaped creatures only several millimeters long. Moving through the water by means of paddle-like appendages, they ravenously hunt down tinier organisms such as bacteria and algae, and are in turn food for organisms as diverse as fish fry and baleen whales. Some are even parasitic. Their numbers are such that divers often hear a crackling sound around them as millons of copepods move through the current. The bristlemouths, or lightfishes, are considered the most numerous fish on the planet, exceeding even the famously plentiful herring in numbers, and are also the most numerous vertebrate, period. They comprise the family Gonostomatidae, which contains over 30 species. Bristlemouths are deep sea fishes, and, as befitting their pitch-black environs, boast rows of light-emitting organs called photophores along their sides. These monstrous little creatures form a key component of the ocean  . Their ubiquity contrasts with their fragility: bristlemouths brought to the surface by deep-sea trawling are often damaged. Though perfectly suited to the ocean deep, their delicate black or translucent skins are no match for the abrasions and pressures changes sustained during capture. Just be glad the little suckers are aquatic...the oral "bristles" that give them their name look kind of stabby to me. The most numerous species of amphibian is almost certainly a frog. Exactly which species of the slick-skinned critters is most populous remains unknown. The order Anura, which comprises frogs and toads, contains some 5,500 species, but many are rare or found only within a limited range. The common frog ( ) ranges across much of Europe and the wood frog ( ) can be found plopping into the waters of even the more northerly portions of North America, which would make these species good bets. However, the fully aquatic African clawed frog ( ) can be found throughout most of the African continent, particularly the southern portion, so it may give its cousins a run for their money. Whichever species boasts the most specimens, the likelihood of biblical plagues of frogs swarming modern cities is ever-diminishing: amphibians world-wide are threatened by the chytrid fungus, which can wipe out entire populations. There are few firm estimates as to which species of reptile is actually the most numerous. There are a couple of likely guesses, though. The viviparous lizard inhabits a huge swath of Europe and Asia, from the U.K. and France to Japan and Russia; it can even tolerate the lower regions of the Arctic. Its name refers to its ability to give birth to live young in the colder regions of its range. The dozen or so species of garter snake that populate most of North America may come close in biomass. Whichever reptile it is, you can be sure it’s a lizard or snake. These creatures, which form the order Squamata, comprise the bulk of the Reptilia. Even herpetophobes can take comfort in the fact that the majority of these species are completely harmless. They also gobble up crop-damaging, disease-bearing rodents and insects, so there’s that. Imagine Tippi Hedren’s horror. Native to some two-thirds of Africa, the red-billed quelea ( ) is thought to be the most numerous species of bird on Earth. Estimates of the species’s population, which fluctuates from season to season, put the number of individual queleas at 1 to 10 billion. These birds closely resemble sparrows and finches, but are only distantly related. They form enormous flocks that migrate as the availability of the grass seeds they eat changes. They are among the most significant agricultural pests in Africa. With large flocks capable of decimating harvests, remediation measures such as aerial spraying with poison have been implemented, meaning that predators and scavengers who devour the avian amuse-bouche are poisoned as well.  Humans are likely the most numerous species of mammal on Earth at the moment. Having reached some 7 billion in 2011, we outnumber our fellow furries by a wide margin. The only species that may come close to (or exceed) us in numbers are the brown rat ( ) and house mouse ( ), whose evolutionary histories and distribution are closely tied to our own. Given that these rodents are unlikely to develop literacy skills and begin sending in census forms—NIMH escapees excepted—we’ll probably never know. Not sure which is grosser...more than 7 billion rats or more than 7 billion people.

Content: Few animals strike as much fear into people as venomous  . Although the chances of running into a venomous snake, much less being bitten and dying from the toxin injected into one’s body, are miniscule compared to dying from cancer, heart disease, or an automobile accident, this seemingly unreasonable fear remains very real for many people. The snakes described here live primarily in tropical regions, but some might be living in research centers and zoos near you. The “black,” or black-mouthed,   (Dendroaspis polylepis) inhabits rocky savanna and can often be encountered on the ground, where it seems to be fond of termite mounds. Ranging in color from gray to dark brown, its name derives from the blackened inside of its mouth. The black mamba is feared because it is large and quick, and it possesses an extremely potent venom that kills most of its human victims. Despite its aggressive reputation, unprovoked attacks on humans have not been proved, and it is responsible for only a small number of deaths annually.  The venom of some species, including the Okinawa habu (T. flavoviridis), an aggressive snake that often enters human dwellings in the Ryukyu Islands, is mildly dangerous. On the other hand, the venom of the terciopelo (B. asper), the fer-de-lance of Central America is necrotizing, painful, and often deadly. Other dangerous   include the jararaca  (B. jararca) of Brazil and the wutu (Bothrops alternatus) of Argentina. The   ( ) hunts by extending the forward part of its body motionless from a tree, its form mimicking a branch. A rear-fanged snake, it delivers its venom by chewing on its victim until the victim succumbs to the toxins. The eastern   ( ) is the most widely distributed type of tiger snake, which inhabits the southern fringe of Australia and the region’s nearby islands. As it prepares to strike, it flattens its head and neck in a manner similar to Asian and African cobras. The   ( ) may be the deadliest of all snakes, since scientists believe it to be responsible for more human deaths than all other snake species combined. Its venom, however, is lethal in less than 10 percent of untreated victims, but the snake’s aggressiveness means it bites early and often. The   ( ) is a highly venomous relative of the cobra. Its venom is essentially a neurotoxin that induces paralysis. The   ( ) is the longest venomous snake in the world. Its bite delivers a tremendous amount of paralysis-inducing neurotoxins. The snake’s venom is so strong and so voluminous that it can kill an elephant in just a few hours. Death also results in at least 50 to 60 percent of untreated human cases. The coastal taipan ( ) produces venom that is nearly identical to that of its inland cousin. Its bite is lethal in more than 80 percent of untreated cases. The bite of an inland or  — , also called, appropriately, the fierce snake—delivers a veritable witch’s brew of toxins. The venom consists of taipoxin, a complex mix of neurotoxins, procoagulants, and myotoxins that paralyze muscles, inhibit breathing, cause hemorraging in blood vessels and tissues, and damage muscles.

					 The insect thorax consists of three segments (called the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax), which may be fused but are usually recognizable. Each segment has four groups of hard plates (sclerites); the groups are the notum (upper), the pleura (sides), and the sternum (underside). Thoracic sclerites are located on a given segment by using an appropriate prefix (pro-, meso-, meta-); for example, the notum (upper sclerite) of the prothorax is the pronotum. Each segment bears a pair of legs, and, in the mature insect, the mesothorax and metathorax typically carry a pair of wings. Each leg always consists of five parts: a coxa   to the thorax, a small trochanter, a femur, a tibia, and a tarsus with one to five segments. The tarsal segments often carry claws with adhesive pads between them (arolia or pulvilli); these enable the insect to hold onto smooth surfaces. The legs may be modified for leaping, burrowing, grasping  , or swimming in various ways. The wings at rest may be extended permanently on each side, as in some   (Odonata), or held erect above the body, as in mayflies (Ephemeroptera); in most insects, however, they are folded against the abdomen. The wing consists of cuticular sacs that bud out from the wall of the thorax; the sacs become flattened during development, and the two membranes, pressed together, are stiffened by thickenings of the   that form cylindrical veins carrying tracheae, nerves, and circulating   to all parts of the wing. Wings   for flight commonly are made of thin membranous cuticle. In some insects, notably beetles (Coleoptera), the wings of the middle segment of the thorax have become thick and horny and serve as protective sheaths (elytra) of the membranous hindwings. The locomotion of insects is effected by   acting on the external skeleton. In leaping insects (e.g., grasshoppers, fleas) the force of muscle contraction is used to compress a pad of an elastic  ,  ; when the catch mechanism is released, the   in the protein molecule is used to project the insect into the air. Insect flight is achieved by flapping the wings; during these movements the wing blade, twisted as it passes from elevation to depression, produces the same effect as the rotating propeller of an aircraft. Muscles capable of changing this   control the direction of flight. The chief flight muscles control flight in one of two ways: in dragonflies, directly on a lever at the base of each wing; but, in most insects, indirectly by deforming the shape of the thorax. The longitudinal muscles of the thorax depress the wings that are articulated with it; the vertical muscles elevate them. In butterflies, the number of wing beats per second may be as low as 8 to 12, while the rate in mosquitoes may exceed 600. These rates can exceed the frequency of contraction and relaxation of muscles responding to nerves because the muscles, after they have begun contracting and relaxing, respond to the   elastic tension in the thoracic wall, where the frequency is determined by the natural periodic oscillation of the thorax. The flight of insects, despite their small size, conforms to the   laws that regulate the flight of aircraft. The abdomen consists of a maximum of 11 segments, although this number commonly is reduced by  . Appendages are usually absent except in caterpillars, which use up to five pairs of abdominal prolegs in walking, and in   insects where the appendages at the hind end have become transformed into external genitalia. In the male these genitalia are paired claspers used to hold the female; in the female, three pairs of valvulae are used to   eggs during oviposition. In some insects, notably crickets and cockroaches, two feelers, or cerci, at the hind end of the abdomen bear sense organs. The  requirements of insects are much the same as those of  —water, inorganic ions, and essential   (i.e., those that cannot be synthesized by the animal).

On the other hand, insects cannot synthesize adequate quantities of  ; thus, in effect, cholesterol can be defined as a vitamin for insects. Insects that feed solely on some restricted diet (e.g.,   blood,   juices, refined flour) have special cells called  mycetocytes that harbour   microorganisms; these organisms, transmitted through the   to the next generation, benefit their host by furnishing it with an internal source of vitamins and perhaps other essential nutrients. If the symbiotic microorganisms are removed experimentally, an insect fails to grow if not provided with a diet rich in vitamins. The digestive system consists of a   formed from the   region (stomodaeum), a   formed similarly from the anal region (proctodaeum), and a   (mesenteron). The foregut and hindgut are lined by cuticle   with that on the body surface. The mouth is followed by the muscular  , which functions in sucking and swallowing, and the  , which may be enlarged to form a  . The crop discharges into the midgut, sometimes, as in cockroaches, by way of a muscular gizzard or proventriculus.

In the rectum, the epithelial cells lining the gut wall often are enlarged, particularly in restricted areas where they form rectal glands. The epithelial cells of these glands are supplied richly with tracheae and function in the reabsorption of water and  . The rectal contents of insects that inhabit dry   commonly are reduced to dry fecal pellets prior to discharge. In many insects, particularly those which feed on relatively dry foods (e.g., beetles infesting stored grain), the upper segments of the malpighian tubules are bound by a sheath to the rectal surface and form a cryptonephridial system that serves to increase the capacity of the rectum for reabsorbing water and salts. The products of digestion, discharged into the hemocoele, or general body cavity, are transported by the circulatory fluid, or  , to the organs.

Content: The principal biological difference between   and   is that bees (except for parasitic bees) provide their young with a mixture of pollen and honey, but wasps feed their young insects or spiders. And whereas wasps are covered with unbranched hairs, bees have at least a few branched or feathered hairs to which pollen often clings.

Content: Ask a summertime picnicker what their biggest annoyance is, and the answer will likely be “bees.” Landing on uncovered food and drink with impunity, these insects aren’t particularly inclined to leave once they’ve tasted the ambrosial offerings that constitute the average picnic. If irate diners press the issue by brandishing paper plates and rolled newspapers, they won’t hesitate to defend their newfound bounty with a sting. Or four. That latter ability is perhaps the most-acute indication that the prime suspects in a typical picnic raid are not bees at all. In all likelihood, the culprits are actually close cousins to the bees: wasps.   (assuming that they aren’t crushed by their outraged victims). Even the most-uninterested observer can distinguish them in ways that don’t involve being pumped full of venom, though. While the bees and wasps constitute some 20,000 species each—both groups belong to the order Hymenoptera, which also contains ants—the insects most likely to be conflated are honeybees ( ) and any of several representatives of the wasp genera   (commonly known as yellow jackets). If you take a look at the insects, you can see what causes the confusion. Both yellow jackets and honeybees are somewhat bullet-shaped striped insects with wings. (Bees are thought by some entomologists to have evolved from predatory wasps.) However, closer examination of both their appearances and their behavior reveals some key differences. (Adult yellow jackets subsist on nectar and other sources of sugars. They hunt animal food only to nourish their squirmy white little sisters, which in return secrete a nourishing fluid.) Yellow jackets exhibit further adaptations to their raiding ways: aerodynamic and nipped at the waist, they are perfectly suited to taking down other insects or darting in to grab their share of whatever carrion and waste is on offer. Honeybees, in contrast, have no need of such exacting maneuverability as they bop from flower to flower; this is reflected in their more-rounded form, their bodies not tapering to the fighter-jet points of the yellow jacket. So, too, it is reflected in their neighborly absence from your outdoor repast; the human palate craves victuals totally unappetizing to bees. The next time, then, that one of your lunch companions bolts from the picnic table sounding the bee alarm, you might advise him or her as to the true identity of the culprit. And then, once the spread has been safely sealed from prying insects, perhaps invite your companions for a stroll and, along with the real bees, stop and enjoy the flowers.

Viewed zoologically, we humans are  , a  -bearing upright-walking   that lives on the ground and very likely first evolved in   about 315,000 years ago. We are now the only living members of what many zoologists refer to as the human tribe,  , but there is     evidence to indicate that we were preceded for millions of years by other hominins, such as  ,  , and other species of  , and that our species also lived for a time contemporaneously with at least one other member of our  ,   (the  ).

That we and the extinct hominins are somehow related and that we and the  , both living and  , are also somehow related is accepted by anthropologists and biologists everywhere.   the exact nature of our   relationships has been the subject of debate and investigation since the great British naturalist   published his monumental books   (1859) and   (1871).

					 Both in complexity of behaviour and learning capacity,   wasps and bees are the equals of social wasps or honeybees. Social insects, however, have developed a   in which the members must do the work required at the proper time. If the society is to succeed, its needs must be communicated to the individual members, and those individuals must act accordingly. These needs may be met by a temporary change in the behaviour of existing individuals, or they may result in developmental changes that vary the number of individuals in the various castes (e.g., new queens, males, workers, or soldiers). Commonly, both behavioral and developmental changes are initiated by  , chemical messengers that   information from one member of a colony to another. Insect societies are gigantic families, with all individuals being the offspring of a single female. In the   the single   in the hive secretes a   known as the   (oxodecenoic acid), which is taken up by the workers and passed throughout the colony by food sharing. So long as the queen substance is present, all members are informed that the queen is healthy. If the workers are deprived of queen substance, they proceed at once to build queen cells and feed the young   with a special   known as   that results in the production of new queens. All termites and ants and some   of wasps and bees are the only insect groups containing truly social species. However, there are many other species that exhibit some lesser degree of interaction among individuals. Insects feed on every sort of organic matter, and their methods of feeding and   have become modified accordingly. The major climatic   faced by terrestrial insects are   extremes and desiccation. Different species function best at various optimal temperatures. If conditions are too hot, an insect seeks out a cool, moist, and shady spot. If exposed to the sun on a hot day, an insect will position itself so as to present the smallest amount of body surface to the heat. If conditions are too cool, insects will remain in the sun to warm themselves. Many butterflies must spread their wings and expose the large surface to the sun like solar collectors to warm the flight muscles before they can  . Many moths can raise their temperature by vibrating their wings or “shivering” before taking flight. The heat generated in this way is conserved by   or scales that maintain an insulating layer of air around the body. The optimum muscle temperature for flight is from 38 to 40 °C (100 to 104 °F). In extremely cold weather the danger for insects is freezing, and insects that survive winters in cold latitudes are called cold hardy. A few insects (e.g., some caterpillars and aquatic   larvae) tolerate   in body fluids, although it is probable that the cell contents do not freeze. In most insects, however, cold hardiness means resistance to freezing. This resistance results partly from accumulation of large quantities of   as an antifreeze and partly from physical changes in the   that permit supercooling to temperatures far below the   of water without the blood freezing. Preventing water loss is another important aspect of life in terrestrial  . All insects have a waxy ( ) layer that coats the outer surface of the   to prevent water loss from the body wall. In addition, most terrestrial insects also have   to avoid water loss through respiration and waste  . Major changes required for life in an aquatic habitat include modifications of the legs for swimming and adaptations for respiration. Most aquatic insects swim using the second or third (or both) pairs of legs. In some, the distal (away from the body) leg segments may simply be flattened and serve as oars. In others, there is a row of movable hairs on these segments that fold against the leg to offer less resistance during the forward stroke and then extend out, forming an oarlike surface during the power stroke. In some, like the water striders (Gerridae), long thin legs allow them to “walk” on the surface film of ponds and streams. To breathe, some insects simply rise to the water surface and take atmospheric air into their tracheal systems. Mosquito larvae use only the last pair of abdominal spiracles, which open at the tip of a respiratory  .   (e.g.,  ) have converted the space between the protective sheaths on the hind wings (elytra) and the   into an air-storage chamber. Air-breathing insects can prolong the period of submergence by trapping air among their surface hairs. This air film acts as a physical   and makes possible oxygen uptake from water. Other adaptations to an aquatic   have occurred in larvae that obtain all their   directly from the water. In midge larvae, abundant   (breathing tubes) contact the entire thin cuticle.   (Trichoptera) and   (Ephemeroptera) larvae have tracheal gills on the abdomen or  . In   larvae, the gills are inside the rectum, and the water is pumped in and out through the  , whereas   have external rectal gills. Insects may   some protection from the horny or leathery cuticle but may also have various chemical defenses. Some caterpillars have special irritating hairs, which break up into barbed fragments that contain a   substance that causes intense itching and serves as a protection against many  . Dermal glands of many insects discharge repellent or poisonous secretions over the cuticle, whereas others are protected by poisons that are present continuously in the blood and tissues. Such poisons often are derived from the plants on which the insects feed. In many hymenopterans (ants, bees, wasps) accessory glands in the female reproductive system have become modified to produce toxic proteins. These poisons, injected into the   of the  , paralyze it. In this state the prey serves as food for the   larva. Stings are also used by hymenopterans, including ants, wasps, and bees, for self-defense. Concealment is an important protective device for insects. For some, this may be accomplished by simply hiding beneath stones or the bark of  . However, many species rely on some forms of protective  . Protective coloration may take the form of   (cryptic coloration) in which the insect blends into its background. The coloration of many insects copies a specific background with extraordinary detail. Stick insects ( ) can change their colour to match that of the background by moving pigment granules in their epidermal cells. Some caterpillars also have patterns that develop in response to a background, although these are irreversible. Insects such as caterpillars, which rely on cryptic coloration, often combine it with a rigid deathlike position. Alternatively, insects that have well-developed chemical defenses generally show   warning (aposematic) coloration. Experiments have proved that predators such as birds quickly learn to associate such coloration “labels” with nauseous or dangerous prey. Finally, insects without nauseous qualities may gain protection by  —developing a conspicuous colour pattern similar to that found in distasteful species. The factors that limit the numbers of insect species are complex. Experimental studies of a population of grain beetles in a container of   show that the complexities increase if a second species is added. With insects in natural habitats,   not only with members of their own species but with numerous other species as well, the obstacles to survival become increasingly great. Competition among species is reduced to some extent by specialization of species to  , or habitats, for which other insects do not compete. Formerly, controversy arose over whether numbers were always density dependent (i.e., limited by the density of the species itself) or whether catastrophic actions, notably the vagaries of weather, were of prime importance. It has since become generally thought that the ultimate factor in the control of numbers is competition within the species for food and other needs. However, in many circumstances, before competition for food becomes significant, numbers are reduced by external factors. Competition within a species is often reduced by wholesale   to new localities. Migration may occur by active flight or, as in aphids and locusts, largely directed by the wind. Another important factor in the regulation of populations is balanced   of species, in which the prevalence of individuals with given characteristics changes according to the action of   as the state of the   changes. The insect is covered by the cuticle, a layer of inert material laid down by a single sheet of epidermal cells. It consists mainly of  , a carbohydrate also known as polyacetylglucosamine, and  , a hard substance composed of   tanned by  . The cuticle, which has an outer layer of waterproofing   to prevent loss of water by  , also serves as the   to which the   are attached. In insects such as caterpillars, in which the cuticle is soft and flexible, the skeleton is of the hydrostatic type. In this type, body fluid pressure, maintained by muscle   beneath the body wall, provides the firmness necessary for the function of muscles involved in movement. In insects with hard bodies, the cuticle is made up of hardened areas called   that are connected by flexible joints. At the back of the head and in the thorax, hardened ingrowths of the cuticle, known as apodemes, furnish a kind of internal skeleton for muscular attachment. Insect colours depend partly on   incorporated in the cuticle. However, the most important pigments often occur in epidermal cells below the cuticle. In butterflies and moths, pigments may be deposited in flattened hairs, or scales, covering the wings. Some of the most brilliant insect colours are not the result of pigmentation but are physical interference colours produced by fine laminae (grooves or pits) in the surface of the wing scales or the cuticle itself. The ancestors of insects most likely had bodies consisting of many similar segments with only minor aggregation of the nervous system in the   (head) segment. These primitive insect ancestors probably looked something like modern  , with a pair of appendages on each body segment but without a well-developed head. In present-day insects the primitive segments are grouped into three regions known as the head, thorax, and abdomen. The first six primitive segments have fused to form the head, and the appendages of these segments have become modified into antennae that bear numerous sense organs and   that convey food to the mouth. Eyes also are prominent on the head. In most insects the mouthparts, adapted for  , consist of several parts; behind the upper lip or labrum is a pair of hard, toothed  . These are followed by a pair of structures called first  , each consisting of a bladelike lacinia, a hoodlike galea, and a segmented palp   sense organ. The paired second maxillae are partly fused in the midline to form the lower lip, or  . Sometimes a median tonguelike structure, called the  , arises from the floor of the mouth. Insect mouthparts have been modified strikingly and reflect particular methods of feeding. The dipterans (true flies) provide instructive examples. In the primitive bloodsucking flies (e.g., the    ) the mandibles and maxillae form serrated blades that cut through the skin and   of the host  . The  epipharynx and hypopharynx are elongated and grooved so that, when apposed, they form a tube for sucking blood. The tonguelike labium is used for   exposed fluids. Dipteran mouthparts have evolved in two directions. In the   (Culicidae) the mandibles, maxillae, epipharynx, and hypopharynx have become exceedingly slender stylets that form a fine bundle and are used for piercing skin and entering blood vessels. The labium, elongated and deeply grooved, serves only as a sheath for the stylet bundle. In the    , however, mandibles and maxillae have been lost; the tonguelike labium alone remains and serves for feeding on exposed surfaces. Certain flies related to   have reacquired a capacity to suck blood; however, since they have lost both mandibles and maxillae, a new bloodsucking mechanism has developed. Labial teeth have evolved for cutting through the skin, and the labium itself is plunged into the tissues. The     has an arrangement of this kind. In the    , the labium has become a fine, needlelike structure normally protected by a sheath formed from the palps of the lost maxillae. Other mouthpart modifications of the mouthpart components provide the cutting and sucking mouthparts of fleas (Siphonaptera), plant-sucking insects (Homoptera), bloodsucking bugs (Heteroptera), honeybees (Hymenoptera), and nectar-feeding butterflies (Lepidoptera).

Content: Oh no, it’s a bug! There are many different kinds of insects in many different shapes and sizes. Some frighten people, while others delight them. And some play an important role in helping people get healthy. This list will help you gain a greater understanding of bugs.  The Handy Answer Book for Kids (and Parents)   are small creatures with three pairs of legs, a body with three main parts (a head, thorax, and abdomen), and a tough shell-like outer covering, called an exoskeleton. Insects are  , which means they do not have a backbone. Most have one or two pairs of wings and a pair of antennae. There are about 1,000,000 known species of insects in the world, and entomologists (scientists who study bugs) estimate that there are millions (perhaps up to 10 million!) more yet to be discovered. Insects are everywhere—there are more bugs in 1 square mile (about 2.6 sq km) of rural land than there are human beings on the entire globe. Insects are divided into 32 orders, or groups. The largest insect order is the beetles ( ) with 200 different families and approximately 400,000 different species. In fact, one out of every four animals on Earth is some type of beetle. In the United States, there are some 73,000 species of insects: approximately 24,000 beetles, 19,500  , 17,500  ,  , and  , and 11,500   and  .  grow through the process of  , meaning that they undergo change. Insect groups that undergo a complete metamorphosis include beetles, moths, butterflies, sawflies, wasps, ants, bees, and flies. All these groups begin their   as an  . The egg hatches into a  —such as a caterpillar, grub, or maggot—that feeds, molts (sheds its skin), and grows larger. The larva goes through an inactive   stage—for example, it is wrapped up in a cocoon—and emerges as an adult insect, such as a butterfly or beetle, that looks very different from the larva it once was.  Other insect groups do not go through a complete metamorphosis; instead, they experience gradual changes as they turn into adults. These include scales, aphids, cicadas, leafhoppers, true bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, praying mantises, cockroaches, earwigs, and dragonflies. Immature forms of these insects are called nymphs. The   grow and gradually change size, shedding their skin along the way. After a final molt, the full adult form emerges.  and other   fly from one plant to the next so as to feed on the sweet  —and sometimes the  —located in the interior of  . The sugar in nectar supplies insects with the energy they need, and pollen contains protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals. In the process of feeding, many insects transfer pollen—which sticks to their bodies—from one plant’s flower to another.  Pollen, which is a fine powdery grain from a flower’s male reproductive organ, must be transferred to the female reproductive organ of a flower for fertilization to take place and seeds to form. Most adult  , including   and  , have two large  , made up of separate lenses. Sometimes these eyes have thousands of lenses. They all point in different directions to give the insect a very wide field of vision. The lenses also help the insect see movement, enabling it to react quickly to seize its prey or escape danger. You can witness this yourself as you try to swat a fly in your home—it’s very difficult to catch a flying insect! The large round spots on the wings of   and  , which look like big round eyes, are a defense mechanism. When a bird or other animal tries to eat the insect, the insect opens its wings and begins to fly off. The wing movement reveals the moth’s “eyes,” confusing the insect’s enemy by  . The predator hesitates, and the insect is able to escape. Yes.   are   that live in colonies, or underground chambers, which may house as many as 500,000 individuals. Ant chambers are connected to each other and to the surface of the earth by small tunnels. There are rooms for food storage, rooms for mating, and nurseries for the young. A queen produces eggs to supply new ants for the colony. The colony is built and maintained by legions of worker ants, who carry tiny bits of dirt in their mandibles (a pair of appendages near the insect’s mouth) and deposit them near the exit of the colony, forming an ant hill.  While most ant colonies are self-sufficient, Amazon ants, which are aggressive red ants (genus  ) found in the western U.S., steal the   of other ants so as to use them as workers—to build homes for and feed the Amazon ants, who do nothing but fight. They depend completely on these “enslaved” ants for survival. That depends on what you mean by the word  . The   often cited as the   is   (also classified as  ), which lives in western  . These insects can be 22 inches (56 cm) long! They are related to the group of insects called walkingsticks.   get their name from the fact that they do, indeed, look like sticks with legs. The largest walkingsticks can grow to up to 13 inches (33 centimeters) in length. There are approximately 3,000 tropical species of walkingsticks, and 10 species that live in North America. One species,  , is the longest insect in the United States, reaching 7 inches (17.7 cm) in length. If you are talking about the   insect, then take a look at the giant weta ( ), an   insect that can weigh up to two and a half ounces (71 g). These insects may look ferocious and scary because of their size, but they are actually harmless. Another insect that is often considered the biggest is the Actaeon beetle ( ) because it is very bulky looking and can be as big as 3.5 inches (9 cm) long by 2 inches (5 cm) wide and 1.5 inches (4 cm) thick. The  , also called a praying mantid, is a large flesh-eating insect that lives in warm areas of the world. Mantis species from Europe and China were introduced to the northeastern United States many decades ago for use as pest exterminators on farms and in gardens. These   insects—sometimes called “vicious predators”—are among the few insects that can rotate their heads to look over their shoulders, making them extremely effective hunters. They pose in a deceptively humble posture when searching for food, as if their front legs are folded in prayer. Mantises grab their victims with their raptorial front legs, which quickly shoot out from their bodies. Mantises almost always start eating their catch while it is alive, and they often start eating their victim’s neck to quickly end the struggle.  Praying mantises eat a variety of insects—other mantises, beetles, butterflies,  ,  —and  . They also eat small  ,  ,  ,  , and other nesting birds. Because they keep down the populations of “bad bugs” that threaten farms, they are highly useful to agricultural workers. Many people think of   as insects, but actually they are classified in a separate category. Spiders are part of a group called  , which also includes  ,  , and  . Arachnids share many features with their arthropod cousins, but they differ in that they do not have antennae. Spiders also have eight legs (insects have six), and spiders’ bodies are segmented into two parts (insects’ bodies have three parts). Both   and   maggots are used occasionally in the field of medicine. The U.S. federal government’s   considers both bugs “approved medical devices,” the first live animals to be called that name. Blow fly maggots are used to eat dead tissue, thus helping to kill  , clean open wounds, and stimulate healing. Leeches   from the body, and their saliva contains a powerful blood thinner. Thousands of laboratory-grown maggots are delivered to hospitals across the United States every week.

The bioengineer must be well grounded in biology and have engineering knowledge that is broad, drawing upon electrical, chemical, mechanical, and other engineering  . The bioengineer may work in any of a large range of areas. One of these is the provision of   means to assist defective body functions—such as hearing aids, artificial limbs, and supportive or substitute organs. In another direction, the bioengineer may use engineering methods to achieve biosynthesis of animal or plant products—such as for fermentation processes. Before   the field of bioengineering was essentially unknown, and little communication or interaction existed between the engineer and the life scientist. A few exceptions, however, should be noted. The agricultural engineer and the chemical engineer, involved in fermentation processes, have always been bioengineers in the broadest sense of the definition since they deal with biological systems and work with biologists. The civil engineer, specializing in sanitation, has applied biological principles in the work. Mechanical engineers have worked with the medical profession for many years in the development of artificial limbs. Another area of   that falls in the field of bioengineering is the air-conditioning field. In the early 1920s engineers and physiologists were employed by the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers to study the effects of temperature and humidity on humans and to provide design   for heating and air-conditioning systems. Today there are many more examples of interaction between biology and engineering, particularly in the medical and life-support fields. In addition to an increased awareness of the need for communication between the engineer and the associate in the life sciences, there is an increasing recognition of the role the engineer can play in several of the biological fields, including human medicine, and, likewise, an awareness of the contributions biological   can make toward the solution of engineering problems. Much of the increase in bioengineering activity can be credited to electrical engineers. In the 1950s bioengineering meetings were dominated by sessions devoted to medical  . Medical instrumentation and medical electronics continue to be major areas of interest, but biological modeling, blood-flow  , prosthetics,   (dynamics of body motion and strength of materials), biological  , biomaterials, and other areas are now included in conference programs. Bioengineering developed out of specific desires or needs: the desire of surgeons to bypass the heart, the need for replacement organs, the requirement for life support in space, and many more. In most cases the early interaction and education were a result of personal contacts between physician, or physiologist, and engineer. Communication between the engineer and the life scientist was immediately recognized as a problem. Most engineers who wandered into the field in its early days probably had an exposure to biology through a high-school course and no further work. To overcome this problem, engineers began to study not only the subject matter but also the methods and techniques of their counterparts in medicine,  , psychology, and biology. Much of the information was self-taught or obtained through personal association and discussions. Finally, recognizing a need to assist in overcoming the communication barrier as well as to prepare engineers for the future, engineering schools developed courses and curricula in bioengineering.

					 Most insects begin their lives as fertilized eggs. The  , or  , is commonly pierced by respiratory openings that lead to an air-filled meshwork inside the shell. For some insects (e.g.,   and  ) a batch of eggs is cemented together to form an   or ootheca. Insects may pass unfavourable seasons in the egg stage. Eggs of the     (Collembola) and of some grasshoppers (Orthoptera) pass summer   in a dry shrivelled state and resume development when moistened. Most eggs, however, retain their water although they may pass the winter in a state of arrested development, or  , usually at some early stage in embryonic development. However, dried eggs of   mosquitoes enter a state of dormancy after development is complete and quickly hatch when placed in water. The hatching of young   is achieved in several ways. Some, such as  , bite their way out of the egg. Many, such as the  , have   spines with which they cut a slit in the shell. Some insect eggs have a preformed “escape cap” that the larva pops from the shell by increasing the pressure inside the egg. Depending on the  , this may be accomplished either by swallowing air and then constricting   in the body to   pressure on the cap or by having an expandable region on the   (many   have a ptilinum) that can be extended by hydraulic (blood) pressure. After hatching, the larva continues to distend itself in this way, although the ptilinum collapses back into the body, until the   hardens. Once formed, the insect cuticle cannot grow. Growth can occur only by a series of molts ( ) during which new and larger cuticles form and old cuticles are shed. Molting makes possible large changes in body form. In the most primitive wingless insects ( ) such as the    , there is almost no change in form throughout growth to the  . These are known as   insects. Among insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), true bugs (Heteroptera), and homopterans (e.g.,  , scale insects), the general form is constant until the final  , when the larva undergoes substantial changes in body form to become a winged adult with fully developed genitalia. These insects, called hemimetabolous, are said to undergo  . The higher orders of insects, including   (butterflies and moths),   (beetles),   (ants, wasps, and bees), Diptera (true flies), and several others, are called   because larvae are totally unlike adults. These larvae undergo a series of molts with little change in form before they enter into complete  , which includes molting first into   and then into fully winged adults. Larvae, which vary considerably in shape, are classified in five forms:  eruciform (caterpillar-like),  scarabaeiform (grublike),  campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active),  elateriform (wireworm-like), and   (maggot-like). The three types of pupae are:  , with appendages more or less glued to the body;  , with the appendages free and not glued to the body; and  coarctate, which is essentially exarate but remaining covered by the cast skins (exuviae) of the next to the last larval instar (name given to the form of an insect between molts).

Content: There’s another food revolution coming. And it isn’t a quiet one. It’s practically buzzing. And clicking. And crunching. It’s almost orchestral, really, in a tinny, droning sort of way. That’s right: an increasing number of scientists suggest that if we’re to support our booming population in the coming decades, we must turn to new sources of protein, namely, in the form of insects. If the leaps in grain production in the late 1960s—attributable to genetic engineering and improved agricultural techniques—constituted a Green Revolution, this is a protein revolution. It’s not going to go down easy, not in the Western world at least. Though residents of equatorial countries have long availed themselves of the protein-rich flesh of insects, Westerners usually still find their gorges rising at the thought of ingesting a single bug, let alone a risotto studded with them. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) wants to find ways around this squeamishness. In doing so, it turned to a cadre of entomologists, food scientists, and other experts, who issued a report on the subject in 2013. Notably, the report emphasized that raising insects for food uses substantially fewer resources than raising large vertebrate livestock. The lead author, entomologist Arnold van Huis, says, “Crickets, grasshoppers and locusts are my favorites, in particular when they are nicely cooked and seasoned. Deep-fried, they can also become nicely crunchy.” What is the name for an insect’s egg-laying organ? How many known species of insects are there? You may...

					 Insects are responsible for two major kinds of damage to growing crops. First is direct injury done to the   by the feeding insect, which eats leaves or burrows in stems,  , or roots. There are hundreds of     of this type, both in   and adults, among  , homopterans,  , coleopterans, lepidopterans, and dipterans. The second type is indirect damage in which the insect itself does little or no harm but transmits a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection into a crop. Examples include the viral diseases of sugar   and potatoes, carried from plant to plant by  . Although most insects grow and multiply in the crop they damage, certain grasshoppers are well-known exceptions. They can exist in a relatively harmless solitary phase for a number of years, during which time their numbers may increase. They then enter a   phase, forming gigantic migratory swarms, which are transported by winds or flight for hundreds or thousands of miles. These swarms may completely destroy crops in an invaded region. The   ( ) and   ( ) are two examples of this type of life cycle. Insect damage to humans and   also may be direct or indirect. Direct   injury by   is of relatively minor importance, although swarms of biting   and   often make life almost intolerable, as do   ( ) and salt-marsh mosquitoes. Persistent irritation by biting flies can cause deterioration in the health of  . Some  , in addition to depositing their eggs in carcasses, also invade the tissue of living   including humans, a condition known as  . An example of an insect that causes this condition is the   ( ) of the southern   and  . In many parts of the world, various blowflies infest the fleece and skin of  . This infestation, called  sheep-strike, causes severe economic damage. Many major human diseases are produced by microorganisms conveyed by insects, which serve as   of pathogens.   is caused by the protozoan  , which spends part of its developmental cycle in   mosquitoes.    , caused by  , is transmitted by the    .  , caused by the protozoan  , is carried by the sand fly  .   in humans and a group of cattle diseases that are widespread in Africa and known as   are caused by protozoan   transmitted by the bites of   ( ). Under nonsanitary conditions the common     can play an incidental role in the spread of human intestinal infections (e.g.,  , bacillary and amebic  ) by contamination of food. The   bacillus can be spread by deerfly bites, the bubonic   bacillus by fleas, and the epidemic   rickettsia by the louse  . Various mosquitoes spread viral diseases (e.g., several   diseases;   and   in humans and other animals). The relationships among the various organisms are complex. Malaria, for example, has a different   in almost every country in which it occurs, with different   species responsible for its spread. These same   affect the spread of sleeping sickness. Some relationships are indirect. Plague, a disease of   transmitted by   bites, is dangerous to humans only when heavy mortality among domestic   forces their infected fleas to attack people, thereby causing an outbreak of plague. Typhus, tularemia, encephalitis, and yellow fever also are maintained in   reservoirs and spread occasionally to humans. The historical objective of the entomologist was primarily to develop and introduce modifications into the   in such ways that diseases will not be spread by insects and crops will not be damaged by them. This objective has been achieved in numerous cases. For example, in many cities flies no longer play a major role in spreading intestinal infections, and land drainage, improved housing, and   use have eliminated malaria in many parts of the world. Massive outbreaks of the   in the 1860s led to the first large-scale use of   in agriculture. These highly poisonous chemicals (e.g., Paris green, lead arsenate, concentrated nicotine) were used in large quantities. The continued search for effective     led in the early 1940s to the production of  , a remarkable   that is highly toxic to most insects, nontoxic to humans in small quantities (although   effects may be severe), and long-lasting in effect. Widely used in agriculture for many years, DDT was not the perfect insecticide. It often killed parasites as effectively as the pests themselves, creating ecological imbalances that permitted new pests to develop large populations. Furthermore, resistant strains of pests appeared. The environmental longevity of many early insecticides was also found to cause significant ecological problems. Similar difficulties were encountered with many successors to DDT, such as Dieldrin and Endrin. In the course of developing effective insecticides, the primary emphases have been to reduce their potential to cause human health problems and their impact on the  .   methods of pest management have become increasingly important as the use of undesirable insecticides decreases. Biological methods include introducing pest strains that carry lethal  , flooding an area with sterile males (as was successfully done for the control of the screwworm fly), or developing new kinds of insecticide based on modifications of insects’ growth hormones. The   industry in Hawaii and the California citrus industry rely on biological control methods. Although these methods are not consistently effective, they are considered to be less harmful to the environment than are some chemicals.

Content: Success consists of going from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm. So goes the aphorism attributed (probably wrongly) to Winston Churchill. Whatever the provenance of the quote, these organisms have taken the message to heart. They’ve surmounted disease, starvation, predation, and human intervention to become the most populous species of their respective taxonomic categories, evincing an unwavering enthusiasm for reproduction and a terrifying degree of fecundity. Of course, it is impossible to obtain exact population counts for many creatures, especially those with secretive or nocturnal lifestyles or those that are almost ubiquituous. So, some of these are merely inferences based on the breadth of a particular species’ range or on other extrapolations from the best available information. I’ve ignored invasive species, and, especially, domesticated species, some of which number well into the billions. It hardly comes as a surprise that ants are the most numerous insect in the world. These colonial hymenopterans may number from 10-100,000 trillion individuals globally; there are more than 10,000 species. The springtails, or Collembola, used to hold the title, but they are no longer officially insects, but rather part of a larger subphylum that includes insects and several related creatures. Though a few species are considered pests, ants are hugely benefical in most environments, spreading seeds and disposing of detritus as they forage for food. The copepods, in addition to being the world’s most numerous crustacean, may also in fact be the world’s most populous multi-celled organism. Found in fresh and salt water worldwide, the roughly 12,000 species are key participants in all of the ecosystems they inhabit. Most are vase-shaped creatures only several millimeters long. Moving through the water by means of paddle-like appendages, they ravenously hunt down tinier organisms such as bacteria and algae, and are in turn food for organisms as diverse as fish fry and baleen whales. Some are even parasitic. Their numbers are such that divers often hear a crackling sound around them as millons of copepods move through the current. The bristlemouths, or lightfishes, are considered the most numerous fish on the planet, exceeding even the famously plentiful herring in numbers, and are also the most numerous vertebrate, period. They comprise the family Gonostomatidae, which contains over 30 species. Bristlemouths are deep sea fishes, and, as befitting their pitch-black environs, boast rows of light-emitting organs called photophores along their sides. These monstrous little creatures form a key component of the ocean  . Their ubiquity contrasts with their fragility: bristlemouths brought to the surface by deep-sea trawling are often damaged. Though perfectly suited to the ocean deep, their delicate black or translucent skins are no match for the abrasions and pressures changes sustained during capture. Just be glad the little suckers are aquatic...the oral "bristles" that give them their name look kind of stabby to me. The most numerous species of amphibian is almost certainly a frog. Exactly which species of the slick-skinned critters is most populous remains unknown. The order Anura, which comprises frogs and toads, contains some 5,500 species, but many are rare or found only within a limited range. The common frog ( ) ranges across much of Europe and the wood frog ( ) can be found plopping into the waters of even the more northerly portions of North America, which would make these species good bets. However, the fully aquatic African clawed frog ( ) can be found throughout most of the African continent, particularly the southern portion, so it may give its cousins a run for their money. Whichever species boasts the most specimens, the likelihood of biblical plagues of frogs swarming modern cities is ever-diminishing: amphibians world-wide are threatened by the chytrid fungus, which can wipe out entire populations. There are few firm estimates as to which species of reptile is actually the most numerous. There are a couple of likely guesses, though. The viviparous lizard inhabits a huge swath of Europe and Asia, from the U.K. and France to Japan and Russia; it can even tolerate the lower regions of the Arctic. Its name refers to its ability to give birth to live young in the colder regions of its range. The dozen or so species of garter snake that populate most of North America may come close in biomass. Whichever reptile it is, you can be sure it’s a lizard or snake. These creatures, which form the order Squamata, comprise the bulk of the Reptilia. Even herpetophobes can take comfort in the fact that the majority of these species are completely harmless. They also gobble up crop-damaging, disease-bearing rodents and insects, so there’s that. Imagine Tippi Hedren’s horror. Native to some two-thirds of Africa, the red-billed quelea ( ) is thought to be the most numerous species of bird on Earth. Estimates of the species’s population, which fluctuates from season to season, put the number of individual queleas at 1 to 10 billion. These birds closely resemble sparrows and finches, but are only distantly related. They form enormous flocks that migrate as the availability of the grass seeds they eat changes. They are among the most significant agricultural pests in Africa. With large flocks capable of decimating harvests, remediation measures such as aerial spraying with poison have been implemented, meaning that predators and scavengers who devour the avian amuse-bouche are poisoned as well.  Humans are likely the most numerous species of mammal on Earth at the moment. Having reached some 7 billion in 2011, we outnumber our fellow furries by a wide margin. The only species that may come close to (or exceed) us in numbers are the brown rat ( ) and house mouse ( ), whose evolutionary histories and distribution are closely tied to our own. Given that these rodents are unlikely to develop literacy skills and begin sending in census forms—NIMH escapees excepted—we’ll probably never know. Not sure which is grosser...more than 7 billion rats or more than 7 billion people.

					 For primitive peoples who gathered  , insects were a significant food source.   plagues,   swarms, large palm   grubs, and other insects are still sources of   in some countries.

Two of the most important domesticated insects are the   (Lepidoptera) and the   (Hymenoptera). Some coarse silks are produced from the   of large wild silkworm  . Most commercial silks, however, come from the silkworm  . This insect is unknown in the wild state and exists only in  . It was domesticated in   thousands of years ago, and  , notably in China and Japan, has produced many specialized strains. The honeybee is a close relative of existing wild  . In the  ,   was Europe’s most important  , and both beeswax and honey are still articles of commerce. However, the major importance of honeybees lies in their   of   trees and other crops. When insects that break down dead trees invade structural timbers in buildings, they become  . This is true of insects such as   and various   that ecologically are latecomers to   and are capable of breaking down the   in hair and feathers. When these insects invade skins, furs, and wool garments or carpets, they can become problems for humans. In many hot, dry climates, as in   or the plains of India, ripened   in the fields is invaded by certain beetles and moths. When the grain is harvested, these insects thrive in the grain stores. They can be carried throughout the world in commerce and have become universal pests of stored grain, dried fruit,  , and other products.   and disinfestation methods are used to control importation of such insects from grain-exporting countries. Many insects are   feeders, and, when the plants are of agricultural importance, humans are often forced to compete with these insects. Populations of insects are limited by such factors as unfavourable  , predators and  , and viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases, as well as many other factors that operate to make insect populations stable.   that encourage the planting of ever larger areas to single crops, which provides virtually unlimited food resources, has removed some of these regulating factors and allowed the rate of   of insects that attack those crops to increase. This increases the probability of great infestations of certain insect pests. Many natural forests, which form similar giant monocultures, always seem to have been subject to periodic outbreaks of destructive insects. In some agricultural monocultures, nonnative insect pests have been accidentally introduced along with a crop but without also bringing along its full range of natural enemies. This has occurred in the   with the   ( ) of apple and other fruit trees, the   ( ) of citrus, the   ( ; also called  ), and others. The   ( ), which caused appalling destruction to the     in the United States beginning about 1840, was a native insect of semidesert country. The beetle, which fed on the buffalo burr plant, adapted itself to a newly introduced and abundant diet of potatoes and thus escaped from all previous controlling factors. Similar situations often have been controlled by determining the major predators or parasites of an alien insect   in its country of origin and introducing them as control agents. A classic example is the cottony-cushion scale, which threatened the California citrus industry in 1886. A predatory  , the   ( ), was introduced from  , and within a year or two the   had virtually disappeared. The success was repeated in every country where the scale insect had become established without its predators. In eastern Canada in the early 1940s the European  spruce sawfly ( ), which had caused   damage, was completely controlled by the spontaneous appearance of a   disease, perhaps unknowingly introduced from Europe. This event led to increased interest in using insect diseases as potential means of managing pest populations.

Insect bodies have three segments: head, thorax (which bears three pairs of legs and usually two pairs of wings), and many-segmented abdomen. Many species undergo complete metamorphosis. There are two subclasses: Apterygota (primitive, wingless forms, including silverfish and bristletails) and Pterygota (more advanced, winged or secondarily wingless forms). The approximately 27 orders of Pterygota are generally classified by wing form: e.g., Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera ( ), Heteroptera (bugs).

Content:  Within the next century or two, we  humans are likely to upgrade ourselves into gods and change the most basic principles of the evolution of life. Traditional mythologies depicted gods as powerful beings that could design and create life according to their wishes. In the coming two centuries we will probably learn how to engineer and manufacture various life forms according to our wishes. We will use  bioengineering in order to create new kinds of organic beings; we will use direct brain-computer interfaces in order to create cyborgs (beings that combine organic and inorganic parts); and advances in machine learning and   might even allow us to set in motion the creation of completely inorganic beings. The main products of the future economy will not be food, textiles, and vehicles but rather bodies, brains, and minds. This will be not just the greatest revolution in history but the greatest revolution in biology since the appearance of life on Earth. For four billion years life was governed by the laws of natural selection. During all these eons, whether you were a virus or a dinosaur, you evolved according to the principles of natural selection. In addition, no matter what strange and bizarre shapes life took, it remained confined to the organic realm. Whether a cactus or a whale, you were made of organic compounds and you remained subject to the laws of organic chemistry. In the next two centuries, however, science could be ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds—but   intelligent design and the intelligent design of our cloud computing. In the process,   itself will likely disappear. In 200 years Earth will probably be dominated by entities more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals or chimpanzees. Today we still share with Neanderthals and chimpanzees most of our bodily structures, physical abilities, and mental faculties. Not only are our hands, eyes, and brains distinctly hominid, but so are our lust, our love, our anger, and our social bonds. Within 200 years the combination of  biotechnology and AI might result in bodily, physical, and mental traits that completely break free of the hominid mold. For example, brain-computer interfaces could result in distributed bodies—beings whose organs are spread widely in space. Some believe that consciousness might be severed from any organic structure and could surf cyberspace free of traditional biological and physical constraints. On the other hand, we might witness the decoupling of intelligence from  consciousness.  Intelligence is the ability to solve problems. Consciousness is the ability to feel things, such as pain, joy, love, and anger. In mammals the two go together. Mammals solve problems by feeling things. But computers are very different. So far the amazing development of computer intelligence has not been accompanied by any development of computer consciousness. There might be several alternative ways leading to  superintelligence, only some of which pass through the straits of consciousness. For millions of years mammalian evolution has been slowly sailing along the conscious route. The evolution of inorganic life forms, however, may completely bypass these narrow straits, charting a different and much quicker course to superintelligence. We might end up with a world dominated by superintelligent but completely  nonconscious  entities.  Encyclopædia Britannica Anniversary Edition: 250 Years of Excellence (1768–2018).

					 Scientists familiar with insects realize the difficulty in attempting to estimate individual numbers of insects beyond areas of a few acres or a few square miles in extent. Figures soon become so large as to be incomprehensible. The large populations and great variety of insects are related to their small size, high rates of reproduction, and   of suitable food supplies. Insects abound in the tropics, both in numbers of different kinds and in numbers of individuals. If the insects (including the young and adults of all forms) are counted on a square yard (0.84 square metre) of rich moist surface soil, 500 are found easily and 2,000 are not unusual in soil samples in the north temperate zone. This amounts to roughly 4 million insects on one moist acre (0.41 hectare). In such an area only an occasional  ,  , or large  , supergiants among insects, probably would be noticed. Only a few thousand  , those that attack people’s crops, herds, and products and those that carry disease, interfere with   life seriously enough to require control measures. Insects are adapted to every land and freshwater habitat where food is available, from   to  , from glacial fields and cold mountain streams to  , lowland ponds and  . Many live in brackish water up to   the salinity of seawater, a few live on the surface of seawater, and some     can live in pools of crude  , where they eat other insects that fall in. Insects play many important roles in nature. They aid  ,  , and other organisms in the decomposition of organic matter and in soil formation. The decay of carrion, for example, brought about mainly by bacteria, is accelerated by the   of   and  . The activities of these larvae, which distribute and consume bacteria, are followed by those of moths and beetles, which break down hair and feathers. Insects and   have evolved together.

Content: Few animals strike as much fear into people as venomous  . Although the chances of running into a venomous snake, much less being bitten and dying from the toxin injected into one’s body, are miniscule compared to dying from cancer, heart disease, or an automobile accident, this seemingly unreasonable fear remains very real for many people. The snakes described here live primarily in tropical regions, but some might be living in research centers and zoos near you. The “black,” or black-mouthed,   (Dendroaspis polylepis) inhabits rocky savanna and can often be encountered on the ground, where it seems to be fond of termite mounds. Ranging in color from gray to dark brown, its name derives from the blackened inside of its mouth. The black mamba is feared because it is large and quick, and it possesses an extremely potent venom that kills most of its human victims. Despite its aggressive reputation, unprovoked attacks on humans have not been proved, and it is responsible for only a small number of deaths annually.  The venom of some species, including the Okinawa habu (T. flavoviridis), an aggressive snake that often enters human dwellings in the Ryukyu Islands, is mildly dangerous. On the other hand, the venom of the terciopelo (B. asper), the fer-de-lance of Central America is necrotizing, painful, and often deadly. Other dangerous   include the jararaca  (B. jararca) of Brazil and the wutu (Bothrops alternatus) of Argentina. The   ( ) hunts by extending the forward part of its body motionless from a tree, its form mimicking a branch. A rear-fanged snake, it delivers its venom by chewing on its victim until the victim succumbs to the toxins. The eastern   ( ) is the most widely distributed type of tiger snake, which inhabits the southern fringe of Australia and the region’s nearby islands. As it prepares to strike, it flattens its head and neck in a manner similar to Asian and African cobras. The   ( ) may be the deadliest of all snakes, since scientists believe it to be responsible for more human deaths than all other snake species combined. Its venom, however, is lethal in less than 10 percent of untreated victims, but the snake’s aggressiveness means it bites early and often. The   ( ) is a highly venomous relative of the cobra. Its venom is essentially a neurotoxin that induces paralysis. The   ( ) is the longest venomous snake in the world. Its bite delivers a tremendous amount of paralysis-inducing neurotoxins. The snake’s venom is so strong and so voluminous that it can kill an elephant in just a few hours. Death also results in at least 50 to 60 percent of untreated human cases. The coastal taipan ( ) produces venom that is nearly identical to that of its inland cousin. Its bite is lethal in more than 80 percent of untreated cases. The bite of an inland or  — , also called, appropriately, the fierce snake—delivers a veritable witch’s brew of toxins. The venom consists of taipoxin, a complex mix of neurotoxins, procoagulants, and myotoxins that paralyze muscles, inhibit breathing, cause hemorraging in blood vessels and tissues, and damage muscles.

In fact,   was the very name of  ’s 2014 documentary about our two contests. I defeated Deep Blue (4–2) in our first face-off in 1996. When the computer defeated me in the first of our six games, it marked the first time a machine had won a game against a world champion under classical tournament conditions. When the computer beat me in the decisive sixth game of our 1997 rematch, its 3.5–2.5 victory (winning two games, with three draws) marked the first time a computer had ever won a classical   against a world champion. When I lost the rematch, it was hailed by many as a momentous occasion for human progress on par with the Moon landing. I didn’t feel so enthusiastic about it myself, but I realized that while the era of intelligent machines was ending in  , it was only getting started in every other aspect of our lives. Real life—language, business, education, health—doesn’t have a tidy framework like chess. Artificial intelligence (AI) today begins with a huge amount of data and clever algorithms to analyze it, without strict pre-existing rules. Machine learning is pushing the frontier of what machines can do better than humans—medical diagnosis, legal research—and how it does it has limitless potential. This type of AI doesn’t care   something works,   it works. These machines even teach themselves better ways to learn, effectively coding themselves iteratively. Chess, still an AI bellwether, demonstrated this principle in astonishing fashion in late 2017, when the machine-learning algorithm   taught itself to play better than any existing program or human after four hours of playing against itself. Think about all the new ways of solving problems based on objective results instead of centuries of accumulated human dogma. This is a brave new world, one in which machines are doing things humans do not know how to teach them to do, one in which machines figure out the rules—and, if we are lucky, explain them to us. If this sounds threatening instead of amazing, you’ve been watching too many dystopian Hollywood movies. Humans will still set the goals and establish the priorities. We must ensure that our agnostic machines represent the best of our human morality. If we succeed, our new tools will make us smarter, enabling us to better understand our world and ourselves. Our real challenge is to avoid complacency, to keep thinking up new directions for AI to explore. And that’s one job that can never be done by a machine. One very real area of concern, however, is the political polarization of the world. Since I retired from professional chess, much of my life has been divided between   activism and investigations into human and machine  , and we are at a critical inflection point in both areas. The global rise of   threatens to roll back a half-century of democratic proliferation that was capped by the fall of the   in 1989 and the collapse of the   two years later. Today, freedom is under assault from all sides—geographically from the Americas to Europe to Asia, politically from both right and left, in regimes that have relatively little experience with democracy and in several of the world’s freest states. The political center is being hollowed out, with extremist positions leading to backlash and whiplash. Over half the world’s population lives under nondemocratic regimes today. Even more troubling, that percentage has been rising. Autocratic regimes like my native Russia have become full-blown dictatorships. A tide of illiberal nationalism is rising in eastern Europe, just one generation removed from life behind the  . Traditional defenders of the values of openness and liberty, the United Kingdom and the United States, were dealt shocking election results by the forces of isolation and nativism. If this trend against freedom is not combated and reversed, the world is headed into a new era of conflict between great powers, with all the human suffering that would entail. The free world is still ascendant—economically, politically, militarily—but if there is no will to leverage that power to make the world freer and safer for all, that   will continue to wane.

Content: These five thinkers transformed Western philosophy and shaped its development from antiquity through the Middle Ages and beyond.  (c. 470–399 BCE) is a founding figure in the history of  , revered for his single-minded dedication to   and virtue, for his great argumentative skill, and for his death, which came to be viewed as a martyrdom. As a result of his public philosophizing in Athens, he was sentenced to death by the city’s democratic government for “impiety” and “corrupting the youth.” He could have saved himself by promising to cease philosophizing or by escaping into exile, but he refused, preferring to drink the deadly hemlock out of respect for the law. Beyond his reputation as a philosophical hero, Socrates is important for reorienting Greek philosophy toward ethical concerns and indeed for insisting that the cultivation of virtue, the “care of the soul,” is overwhelmingly the most important obligation of every human being. He famously asserted at his trial, in defiance of his accusers, that the unexamined life is not worth living. His penetrating style of exploring philosophical questions in conversation, typically exposing contradictions in the positions of his interlocutors, is called the Socratic method. *Socrates wrote nothing. *What is known of his views is inferred from, among other sources, the early dialogues of  , in which “Socrates” is the main character. *Socrates held that virtue is a kind of knowledge and that anyone who knows what virtue is cannot help but act virtuously.  (c. 428–c. 348 BCE) was by far the most gifted and accomplished of Socrates’ students. His thought was systematic, wide-ranging, profound, and extraordinarily influential, providing the foundation of ancient   and, through that school, guiding the development of early medieval philosophy and    . In later ages Platonic ideas influenced the development of 19th-century German   and 20th-century  . Since the late 19th century, Plato’s influence has been most pronounced in the  , where mathematical Platonism is a well-established tradition with many contemporary adherents. Plato’s foremost contribution to philosophy was his theory of  , which posited a realm of ideal, perfect, and changeless entities standing behind the world of ordinary experience. In addition to being a great philosopher, Plato was also a literary artist of the highest rank: he is a major figure in the history of  . *Plato’s philosophical works were written as dialogues, in most of which the principal character and main speaker is “Socrates.” *Plato himself never appears as a character in any of the dialogues. *Plato’s philosophy is the source of many famous literary tropes and myths, including the notion of Platonic love, the  , and the metaphor of the Cave (the world of experience is like a shadow cast on a cave wall by real but unseen objects).  (384–322 BCE), who follows   and   as the third member of the great triumvirate of ancient Greek philosophers, is arguably the most important thinker who ever lived. He made fundamental and pioneering contributions to every major field of philosophy, especially  ,  ,  , the  , the  ,  ,  , and  . He created the field of  , devising a system of reasoning known as   that was not superseded until the mid-19th century. He was in addition the first genuine empirical scientist in history, being the first person to distinguish the major scientific fields (including biology, botany, chemistry, embryology, physics, and zoology) and performing in all of them theoretical and observational work of lasting importance. Following the translation into Latin of his major works beginning about the 12th century, Aristotle’s philosophy eventually became the intellectual framework of later Western  , eclipsing (though not eliminating) the influence of Neoplatonism as passed through   and the  . Following the  , interest in the scientific aspects of Aristotle’s philosophy declined, and other aspects of his philosophy were only intermittently influential. Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, the field of  , a self-conscious revival of Aristotelian   (the theory of well-being), promised an approach to ethics grounded in human nature and free of the counterintuitive consequences of action-based ethical theories. Studies of Aristotle’s writings in ethics, metaphysics, and other fields continue to yield new insights into his thought. *Aristotle briefly served as tutor to the 13-year-old Macedonian  , the future ruler of the entire Greek world as well as North Africa and the Middle East. *Upon Alexander’s death in 323, Aristotle, because of his Macedonian birth and connections, fled Athens, saying that he did not wish the city that had killed Socrates “to sin twice against philosophy.” *All of Aristotle’s finished philosophical treatises are lost. The surviving works attributed to him consist of lecture notes and draft manuscripts. Their compact and abbreviated style contributes to the difficulty of his philosophy.  (354–430) was the preeminent Christian philosopher and theologian of late antiquity. His writings adapted aspects of   to the exposition and defense of Christian orthodoxy, imbuing those religious doctrines with philosophical sophistication and influencing the character of Western philosophy and theology for more than 1,000 years. Among Augustine’s most original and influential contributions to philosophy was his egocentric, or first-person, approach to philosophical questions, reflected in his response to   (“If I am mistaken, I am”), which anticipated the famous   (“I think, therefore I am”) of  . Augustine was also the first philosopher to clearly identify will as a distinct faculty of  . He maintained that the human will is free, and therefore that humans are   for their choices, but he also held that God has foreknowledge of the choices that humans freely make. In the  , he developed an argument for the existence of God that is strikingly similar to the   formulated by   more than 600 years later. A bishop of the Christian church in Roman North Africa, where he was born and spent almost all of his life, St. Augustine is recognized as philosophically the most important of the   (the bishops and other teachers who influenced the development of Christian doctrine during the church’s early centuries). *For 13 years Augustine maintained a monogamous relationship with a woman he did not marry; their son was born when Augustine was about 18 years old. *Augustine’s life coincided with the last century of the Western  . He died during a siege of Hippo by invading Vandals. *One of the most prolific authors in the history of philosophy, Augustine wrote more than 100 books and some 500 sermons, the vast majority of which have survived.  (c. 1224–74) was the greatest of the medieval   philosophers. Responding, as did others of his era, to the rediscovery of  ’s philosophy in the West through Latin translations of Aristotle’s Greek texts, Aquinas produced a comprehensive system of Christianized   that encompassed  ,  , cosmology,  ,  , philosophy of nature,  , and  . While insisting upon, and indeed demonstrating, the compatibility of the “new philosophy” with Christian doctrine, Aquinas also famously distinguished   and   by their different starting points. Although both are rational enterprises, involving a search for   guided by  , philosophy begins from general first principles about the world that any reflective person would accept, whereas theology starts with truths about God or the divine as revealed in Scripture, which can be accepted only on the basis of religious  . During Aquinas’s lifetime, aspects of his philosophy were resisted by more traditional theologians and formally rejected by the church. Some 50 years later, however, he was canonized a saint, and during the Renaissance he was pronounced a doctor of the church. In the late 19th century Pope   called for a return to Aquinas in the face of modernizing trends in both philosophy and science.   (the philosophy of Aquinas and his later interpreters) became the official philosophy of   in 1917, following a revision of the Code of Canon Law that required Catholic teachers of philosophy and religion to adopt Aquinas’s methods and principles. Later in the 20th century Thomism represented an important school of thought even outside Catholic philosophy, especially in ethics, the  , and political philosophy. *Aquinas joined the recently founded mendicant order of   in 1244, when he was about 20 years old. *While journeying to Paris to study, he was kidnapped by his family, who disapproved of his decision to join the  , and was then held at home against his will for about two years. During his detention his brothers engaged a prostitute to seduce him, an effort that was unsuccessful. *Aquinas abruptly abandoned writing in 1273 after undergoing an experience during mass that led him to regard all of his written work as “like straw.” He died three months later.

Biotechnology is the use of   to solve problems and make useful products. The most prominent approach used is genetic engineering, which enables scientists to tailor an organism’s   at will. Biotechnology is particularly important in the field of medicine, where it facilitates the production of therapeutic proteins and other drugs. Synthetic   and synthetic   and diagnostic tests to detect various diseases are just some examples of how biotechnology is impacting medicine. Biotechnology has also proved helpful in refining industrial processes, in environmental cleanup, and in agricultural production. The first molecular and cellular tools of modern biotechnology emerged in the 1960s and ’70s. A fledgling “biotech”   began to coalesce in the mid- to late 1970s. Modern biotechnology stands in contrast to older forms of “biotechnology,” which emerged thousands of years ago, when humans began to domesticate plants and animals.

The most prominent area of biotechnology is the production of therapeutic proteins and other drugs through  . People have been harnessing biological processes to improve their   for some 10,000 years, beginning with the first agricultural  . Approximately 6,000 years ago, humans began to tap the biological processes of microorganisms in order to make bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese and to preserve dairy products. But such processes are not what is meant today by  , a term first widely applied to the molecular and cellular technologies that began to emerge in the 1960s and ’70s. A fledgling “biotech”   began to coalesce in the mid- to late 1970s, led by  , a   company established in 1976 by Robert A. Swanson and Herbert W. Boyer to commercialize the   pioneered by Boyer,  , and Stanley N. Cohen. Early companies such as Genentech, Amgen, Biogen, Cetus, and Genex began by   genetically engineered substances primarily for medical and environmental uses. For more than a decade, the biotechnology industry was dominated by      , or  . This technique consists of splicing the   for a useful   (often a human protein) into  production cells—such as yeast,  , or mammalian cells in culture—which then begin to produce the protein in volume. In the process of splicing a gene into a production  , a new organism is created. At first, biotechnology investors and researchers were uncertain about whether the courts would permit them to     on organisms; after all, patents were not allowed on new organisms that happened to be discovered and identified in nature. But, in 1980, the  , in the case of   v.  , resolved the matter by ruling that “a live human-made microorganism is patentable subject matter.” This decision spawned a wave of new biotechnology firms and the infant industry’s first investment boom. In 1982 recombinant   became the first product made through genetic engineering to secure approval from the U.S.   (FDA). Since then, dozens of genetically engineered protein medications have been commercialized around the world, including recombinant versions of  , clotting factors, proteins for   the production of red and white blood cells,  s, and clot-dissolving agents. In the early years, the main achievement of biotechnology was the ability to produce naturally occurring therapeutic molecules in larger quantities than could be derived from conventional sources such as  , animal organs, and human cadavers. Recombinant proteins are also less likely to be contaminated with pathogens or to provoke allergic reactions. Today, biotechnology researchers seek to discover the root molecular causes of disease and to intervene precisely at that level. Sometimes this means producing therapeutic proteins that augment the body’s own supplies or that make up for genetic deficiencies, as in the first generation of biotech medications. (Gene therapy—insertion of genes   a needed protein into a patient’s body or cells—is a related approach.) The biotechnology industry has also expanded its research into the development of traditional   and   that stop the progress of a disease. Successful production of monoclonal antibodies was one of the most important techniques of biotechnology to emerge during the last quarter of the 20th century. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies and their availability in quantity have made it possible to devise sensitive assays for an enormous range of biologically important substances and to distinguish cells from one another by identifying previously unknown marker molecules on their surfaces. Such advances were made possible through the study of genes ( ), the proteins that they   (proteomics), and the larger biological pathways in which they act.

Viewed zoologically, we humans are  , a  -bearing upright-walking   that lives on the ground and very likely first evolved in   about 315,000 years ago. We are now the only living members of what many zoologists refer to as the human tribe,  , but there is     evidence to indicate that we were preceded for millions of years by other hominins, such as  ,  , and other species of  , and that our species also lived for a time contemporaneously with at least one other member of our  ,   (the  ). In addition, we and our predecessors have always shared Earth with other apelike primates, from the modern-day   to the long-extinct  . That we and the extinct hominins are somehow related and that we and the  , both living and  , are also somehow related is accepted by anthropologists and biologists everywhere.   the exact nature of our   relationships has been the subject of debate and investigation since the great British naturalist   published his monumental books   (1859) and   (1871). Darwin never claimed, as some of his Victorian contemporaries insisted he had, that “man was descended from the  ,” and modern scientists would view such a statement as a useless simplification—just as they would dismiss any popular notions that a certain extinct species is the “ ” between humans and the apes. There is theoretically, however, a common ancestor that existed millions of years ago. This ancestral species does not   a “missing link” along a lineage but rather a node for divergence into separate lineages. This ancient primate has not been identified and may never be known with certainty, because fossil relationships are unclear even within the human lineage, which is more recent.

These scenarios are based on contextual information gleaned from localities where the fossils were collected.

The   and  , here classified as separate orders, sometimes are considered as suborders of an order Hemiptera. Both groups have piercing-sucking mouthparts; for this reason, they are thought to be closely related to each other. Some entomologists, however, consider distinguishing features other than the mouthparts sufficiently important to accord full ordinal status to each group. The term   frequently is used to describe three closely related groups, classified here as three distinct orders: Neuroptera (lacewings), Raphidiodea (snakeflies), and Megaloptera (dobsonflies and alderflies). Although the tendency has been to classify these groups as distinct orders, they sometimes are placed in the order Neuroptera. Among the lepidopterans, members of the family   are more   than existing trichopterans (caddisflies). Although some entomologists treat them as a distinct order (Zeugloptera), others place them in the order Lepidoptera.

Insect bodies have three segments: head, thorax (which bears three pairs of legs and usually two pairs of wings), and many-segmented abdomen. Many species undergo complete metamorphosis. There are two subclasses: Apterygota (primitive, wingless forms, including silverfish and bristletails) and Pterygota (more advanced, winged or secondarily wingless forms). The approximately 27 orders of Pterygota are generally classified by wing form: e.g., Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera ( ), Heteroptera (bugs).

The bioengineer must be well grounded in biology and have engineering knowledge that is broad, drawing upon electrical, chemical, mechanical, and other engineering  . The bioengineer may work in any of a large range of areas. One of these is the provision of   means to assist defective body functions—such as hearing aids, artificial limbs, and supportive or substitute organs. In another direction, the bioengineer may use engineering methods to achieve biosynthesis of animal or plant products—such as for fermentation processes. Before   the field of bioengineering was essentially unknown, and little communication or interaction existed between the engineer and the life scientist. A few exceptions, however, should be noted. The agricultural engineer and the chemical engineer, involved in fermentation processes, have always been bioengineers in the broadest sense of the definition since they deal with biological systems and work with biologists. The civil engineer, specializing in sanitation, has applied biological principles in the work. Mechanical engineers have worked with the medical profession for many years in the development of artificial limbs. Another area of   that falls in the field of bioengineering is the air-conditioning field. In the early 1920s engineers and physiologists were employed by the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers to study the effects of temperature and humidity on humans and to provide design   for heating and air-conditioning systems. Today there are many more examples of interaction between biology and engineering, particularly in the medical and life-support fields. In addition to an increased awareness of the need for communication between the engineer and the associate in the life sciences, there is an increasing recognition of the role the engineer can play in several of the biological fields, including human medicine, and, likewise, an awareness of the contributions biological   can make toward the solution of engineering problems. Much of the increase in bioengineering activity can be credited to electrical engineers. In the 1950s bioengineering meetings were dominated by sessions devoted to medical  . Medical instrumentation and medical electronics continue to be major areas of interest, but biological modeling, blood-flow  , prosthetics,   (dynamics of body motion and strength of materials), biological  , biomaterials, and other areas are now included in conference programs. Bioengineering developed out of specific desires or needs: the desire of surgeons to bypass the heart, the need for replacement organs, the requirement for life support in space, and many more. In most cases the early interaction and education were a result of personal contacts between physician, or physiologist, and engineer. Communication between the engineer and the life scientist was immediately recognized as a problem. Most engineers who wandered into the field in its early days probably had an exposure to biology through a high-school course and no further work. To overcome this problem, engineers began to study not only the subject matter but also the methods and techniques of their counterparts in medicine,  , psychology, and biology. Much of the information was self-taught or obtained through personal association and discussions. Finally, recognizing a need to assist in overcoming the communication barrier as well as to prepare engineers for the future, engineering schools developed courses and curricula in bioengineering.

					 It generally is agreed that insect   evolved as   insects gradually adopted different modes of life from those of  . The characters of larva and adult became genetically independent; in response to  , therefore, each was able to evolve independently of the other. Mouthparts, limbs, and other morphological features were modified in different directions and in higher groups. Where these differences were extreme, an intermediate pupal stage evolved to bridge the morphological gap between larva and adult. It seems quite probable that the development of metamorphosis occurred more than once during the   of insects. Insects did not evolve in a constant  . Throughout geological time there were prodigious changes in climate; in addition, evolution was continuous among all other animals and plants. Geologically the selection pressures among insects were changing continuously. At the end of the   the first   plants appeared. Insect evolution has paralleled that of the flowering plants; they have evolved together. As   (butterflies and moths),   (ants, bees, and wasps),   (true flies), and   (beetles) began to feed upon  ,  , or  , flowering plants came to rely more and more upon insects—rather than upon the wind—for transferring their  . Flowers evolved nectaries, scents, and   colours as attractants for those insects that could effect cross- . Insects likewise evolved appropriate mouthpart modifications for extracting nectar from flowers. During the Mesozoic warm-blooded animals (  and  ) first appeared; by the dawn of the  , they had become predominant among Earth’s large animals. The warm fermenting excrement and the decaying dead bodies of mammals furnished excellent nutrient media for many insect larvae, notably among the Diptera and Coleoptera. The adults in both groups found their nourishment in flowers. Some heteropterans (true bugs) and dipterans pierce the skin of birds and mammals and feed on their  . The   (sucking lice) and the   (fleas) have become so specialized for this type of parasitic existence that their relationships to other insects are not   known with certainty. Evolution is occurring among present-day insects. They exhibit a balanced genetic  ; in other words, in response to small environmental changes, one genetic form, more successful than another, will become more plentiful. Sometimes there is no visible difference between these forms, the advantage presumably lying in some physiological change. It is advantageous for a   to have a   from which favourable characters can be selected so that the species can respond to environmental changes. Changes within a species may occur progressively over a large geographical area. Such a progressive genetic change is called a cline; in some cases insects at the extremes of the cline are so unlike that they are taken as separate species and may be infertile when crossed. One well-known example of evolution in action among insects is   (accumulation of the black pigment  ); many butterflies   industrial areas have become almost black, the black forms being more tolerant of   and less conspicuous to predators. Another example of this  cline type of evolution is the development of insect strains resistant to an   that has been applied heavily in an area for several years. In many parts of the world houseflies became highly resistant to  . The class Insecta is divided into orders on the basis of the structure of the  , including eyes,  , and antennae; the  , including legs and wings; and the  , including segmentation, spiracles, and appendages (cerci, styli, furcula). The genitalia and their accessory structures, usually located in the ninth abdominal segment, are important in  . Other taxonomic   include bristles (their form and arrangement are known as chaetotaxy), sensory receptors (spines, hairs, sensilla, tympanal organs), pattern of wing venation, and position of mouthparts. In addition, type of   and form of larva and   are used to distinguish insects.

					 The insect   has many gaps. Among the primitive apterygotes, only the collembolans ( ) have been found as fossils in the   (about 419.2 million to 358.9 million years ago). Ten insect orders are known as fossils, mostly of Late   and   times (318 million to 251 million years ago). No fossils have yet been found from the Late Devonian (about 382.7 million to 358.9 million years ago) or Early Carboniferous (about 358.9 million to 318 million years ago) period, when the key characters of present-day insects are believed to have evolved; thus, early evolution must be inferred from the   of   insects. It has become evident that insect  , like that of other animals, was far more active at some periods than at others. There have been geological epochs of “explosive” evolution during which many new forms have appeared. Those epochs may have followed some modification or   in body function, or new developments favoured by climatic changes or evolutionary advances of other   and  . During those periods of evolutionary change, new methods of feeding and living led to   of insect   and limbs, the origin of  , and other changes. The simplified family tree shown here illustrates the presumed evolutionary history of winged insects ( ) throughout the geological periods from the Devonian to the Recent. The apterygotes, which are regarded as survivors of primitive insect stock, are omitted from the family tree. Dark lines indicate the periods during which the various orders have been found as fossils. Some lines stop at the names of orders now extinct and known only as fossils. Light lines indicate the   origin of various orders. Many insect types, traces of which have not yet been discovered, must have been produced during the explosive periods of evolution in   and Permian times. The primitive wingless insects gave rise to a paleopterous stock. Descendants of this stock included ancient fossil types that flourished in Permian times, such as the giant dragonflies or   (some of which had a wing span of more than half a metre) and the dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) and mayflies (Ephemeroptera), both of which have   with little change to the present. The primitive insect stock also gave rise to a neopterous stock, believed to include the progenitors of the remaining insect orders. The Orthoptera (grasshoppers) and the   ( ) have been found as fossils even in late Carboniferous times. The   ( , sometimes placed in the order Blattodea),   ( ), and   ( ), though doubtless of ancient origin, have not been found yet as fossils dated earlier than the   (252 million to 66 million years ago). The evolutionary radiation believed to have given rise to the orders listed above in the Middle Carboniferous Period is thought to have also produced a paraneopterous stock, which formed the base for a new evolutionary radiation during the  . Present-day derivatives of this stock evolved into the   ( ),   ( ),   or Siphunculata ( ), Thysanoptera ( ),   (true bugs), and   (e.g., aphids). Several phylogenetic lines are exopterygote—i.e., insects with simple  , some of which, such as Mallophaga and Anoplura, are secondarily wingless. The remaining orders are endopterygote (insects with complete metamorphosis). They are shown in the family tree as derivatives of an oligoneopterous stock, which gave rise to   ( ),   (ants, wasps, and bees), and   (beetles) in the Early Permian Period (298.9 million to 272.3 million years ago); the early ancestry of these orders is obscure, however, and the earliest fossils closely resemble present-day forms. One line from the evolutionary radiation at the beginning of the Permian gave rise to a mecopteroid stock, and there is good evidence that a sub-radiation of these mecopteroid orders (sometimes called the panorpoid complex) provided the origin for the present   ( ),   (true flies),   (fleas),   (caddisflies), and   (butterflies and moths). Insect wings develop as paired outgrowths from the  , stiffened by ribs, or veins, in which run tracheae. These tracheae follow a consistent pattern throughout the Pterygota, and their specific modifications (known as  ) are important in   and in estimations of the degree of relationship between groups. The basic consistency of venation suggests that wings have been evolved only once among the insects; that is, all the Pterygota arose from a single stem in the family tree. By the time fossil insects are found (toward the end of the Carboniferous), wings are developed fully. In the   the wings are held aloft above the back, as in mayflies, or held extended permanently on each side of the body, as in dragonflies. Throughout the   there is a wing-flexing mechanism (secondarily lost in butterflies) that enables the wings to be folded back to rest on the surface of the  . Winged insects must have made their appearance very early in the Carboniferous, but there is no fossil evidence to show the way they evolved. One   is that wings arose as fixed planes extending sideways from the thorax and that these planes were used, perhaps in some large leaping insect, for gliding. Later muscles developed, first to control inclination and then to move the wings in flapping flight. Another hypothesis is that wings may have originated from large thoracic    , similar to the movable tracheal gills along the abdomen of some    . Such outgrowths could have been useful to insects exposed by the drying up of a temporary aquatic habitat and might have carried them in rain-bearing winds to a new watery home. It is likely that the most primitive symphylan-like insects were terrestrial. Throughout insect evolution, however, independent   to aquatic habitats have occurred. Usually the pattern is one in which the adults leave the water and disperse. Many pterygote insects have become secondarily wingless, sometimes as single   or groups of species within large orders and sometimes as entire orders (the parasitic  , Mallophaga and Anoplura, and the fleas, Siphonaptera).

Content:  Within the next century or two, we  humans are likely to upgrade ourselves into gods and change the most basic principles of the evolution of life. Traditional mythologies depicted gods as powerful beings that could design and create life according to their wishes. In the coming two centuries we will probably learn how to engineer and manufacture various life forms according to our wishes. We will use  bioengineering in order to create new kinds of organic beings; we will use direct brain-computer interfaces in order to create cyborgs (beings that combine organic and inorganic parts); and advances in machine learning and   might even allow us to set in motion the creation of completely inorganic beings. The main products of the future economy will not be food, textiles, and vehicles but rather bodies, brains, and minds. This will be not just the greatest revolution in history but the greatest revolution in biology since the appearance of life on Earth. For four billion years life was governed by the laws of natural selection. During all these eons, whether you were a virus or a dinosaur, you evolved according to the principles of natural selection. In addition, no matter what strange and bizarre shapes life took, it remained confined to the organic realm. Whether a cactus or a whale, you were made of organic compounds and you remained subject to the laws of organic chemistry. In the next two centuries, however, science could be ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds—but   intelligent design and the intelligent design of our cloud computing. In the process,   itself will likely disappear. In 200 years Earth will probably be dominated by entities more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals or chimpanzees. Today we still share with Neanderthals and chimpanzees most of our bodily structures, physical abilities, and mental faculties. Not only are our hands, eyes, and brains distinctly hominid, but so are our lust, our love, our anger, and our social bonds. Within 200 years the combination of  biotechnology and AI might result in bodily, physical, and mental traits that completely break free of the hominid mold. For example, brain-computer interfaces could result in distributed bodies—beings whose organs are spread widely in space. Some believe that consciousness might be severed from any organic structure and could surf cyberspace free of traditional biological and physical constraints. On the other hand, we might witness the decoupling of intelligence from  consciousness.  Intelligence is the ability to solve problems. Consciousness is the ability to feel things, such as pain, joy, love, and anger. In mammals the two go together. Mammals solve problems by feeling things. But computers are very different. So far the amazing development of computer intelligence has not been accompanied by any development of computer consciousness. There might be several alternative ways leading to  superintelligence, only some of which pass through the straits of consciousness. For millions of years mammalian evolution has been slowly sailing along the conscious route. The evolution of inorganic life forms, however, may completely bypass these narrow straits, charting a different and much quicker course to superintelligence. We might end up with a world dominated by superintelligent but completely  nonconscious  entities.  Encyclopædia Britannica Anniversary Edition: 250 Years of Excellence (1768–2018).

					 The   consists of a series of   that supply nerves to successive segments of the body. The three main ganglia in the   (protocerebrum, deutocerebrum, and tritocerebrum) commonly are fused to form the  , or supraesophageal ganglion. The rest of the ganglionic chain lies below the   against the ventral body surface. The brain is joined by paired connectives to the subesophageal ganglion, which is linked in turn by paired connectives to the three thoracic and eight abdominal ganglia (numbered according to segment). In most insects the number of separate ganglia has been reduced by  . The last abdominal ganglion always serves several segments. In homopterans and heteropterans all the abdominal ganglia usually fuse with mesothoracic and metathoracic ganglia; and in the   of higher flies (Cyclorrhapha), the ganglia of the brain,  , and   form one mass. Each ganglion is made up of   bodies that lie on the   and a mass of nerve fibres, the neuropile, that occupies the centre. There are two types of nerve cells,   and  association neurons. Motor neurons have main processes, or  , that extend from the ganglia to contractile muscles, and minor processes, or  , that connect with the  . Association neurons, usually smaller than motor neurons, are linked with other parts of the   by way of the neuropile. Cell bodies of the sense organs, called  , lie at the periphery of the body just below the  . Sensory neurons occur as single cells or small   of cells; the distal process, or dendrite, of each cell extends to a cuticular sense organ ( ). The sensilla are usually small hairs modified for perception of specific stimuli (e.g., touch, smell, taste, heat, cold); each sensillum consists of one sense cell and one  . Although these small sense organs occur all over the body, they are particularly abundant in  , palps, and cerci. The sense cell of each sensillum gives off a proximal process, or sensory axon, which runs inward to the central nervous system, where it enters the neuropile and makes contact with the endings of association neurons. Bundles of both sensory axons and motor axons, which are enclosed in protective membranous sheaths,   the nerves.    may be sensitive enough to perceive air vibrations and thus serve as organs for  . Tympanal organs (eardrums) are present in certain butterflies and grasshoppers. Mechanical sensilla (chordotonal organs) below the surface of the cuticle serve for perception of internal strains and body movements. The eyes are of two kinds, simple eyes, or  , and  . In the adults of higher insects both types are present. The visual sense cells are derived from the epidermis, as are those of other sense organs, and are connected to the optic ganglia (a part of the brain) by sensory axons. Each visual sense cell has a zone at its surface, which, on exposure to  , gives rise to chemical products that stimulate the sense cell, called the  retinula cell, and initiate the nerve impulse in the sensory axon. The light-receptive zone, or  , of the retinula cell commonly has a rodlike form; because it lies perpendicular to the surface, light passes lengthwise along it. In the simple eyes (ocelli) a lens-shaped area of cuticle lies over the group of retinula cells that form the  . Since the optical structure is primitive, the visual image received is crude; ocelli can perceive only light, darkness, and movement. The   eye, made up of a number of facets, resembles a honeycomb; each facet overlies a group of six or seven retinal cells that surround the rhabdom. Each of the retinal units below a single facet is termed an ommatidium. The number of facets varies. For example, there are only a few dozen facets in the eye of the primitive    , while the eye of the     has some 4,000, and the highly developed eye of the   may contain up to 28,000. During  , rays from a small area of the field of view fall on a single facet and are concentrated upon the rhabdom of the retinula cells below. Since each point of light differs in brightness, all the   that form the retina receive a crude mosaic of the field of view. Unlike the image in a   or in  , the mosaic image in the compound eye is not inverted but erect. The fineness of the mosaic and, therefore, the degree of   improves with increasing numbers of facets. It is estimated that the eye of the   has visual   equal to 1 percent that of humans. Each ommatidium commonly is shielded by a curtain of pigmented cells that prevent the spread of light to neighbouring ommatidia. This is called an  . In the eyes of insects that   at night or in twilight, however, the pigment can be withdrawn so that light received from neighbouring facets overlaps to some extent. This is called a  . The image formed is brighter but not as sharp as that formed by the apposition eye. In addition to perceiving brightness, the eyes of insects can perceive colour as well as some other properties of light. The most   insects known are found as   in rocks of the Middle   (393.3 million to 382.7 million years ago). The bodies of those insects were divided then, as now, into a head bearing one pair of antennae, a thorax with three pairs of legs, and a segmented abdomen. Those insects originated with the terrestrial branch of the phylum  . The Arthropoda, whose origin is thus far unknown, probably arose in  , perhaps as many as 1 billion years ago. Some arthropods colonized the open sea and have become the present-day class   (crabs, shrimps) and the now-extinct Trilobita. Other arthropods colonized the land. This   line persists chiefly as the classes Onychophora,   (spiders, scorpions, ticks), the   (consisting of   [millipedes],  ,  , and  , or centipedes), and finally the class Insecta. The most primitive insects today are found among the wingless (apterous) hexapods; sometimes known collectively as  , they include  , thysanurans,  , and collembolans. It is agreed generally that insects are related most closely to the   group, among which the Symphyla exhibit most of the essential features required for the ancestral insect form (i.e., a Y-shaped epicranial suture, two pairs of maxillae, a single pair of antennae, styli and sacs on the abdominal segments, cerci, and malpighian tubules). There is, therefore, general agreement that the insects probably arose from an early symphylan-like form.

					 The   into orders presented above is acceptable to most entomologists. Nonetheless, the classification of some groups remains  , and evolutionary relationships remain unclear. The   and  , here classified as separate orders, sometimes are considered as suborders of an order Hemiptera. Both groups have piercing-sucking mouthparts; for this reason, they are thought to be closely related to each other. Some entomologists, however, consider distinguishing features other than the mouthparts sufficiently important to accord full ordinal status to each group. The term   frequently is used to describe three closely related groups, classified here as three distinct orders: Neuroptera (lacewings), Raphidiodea (snakeflies), and Megaloptera (dobsonflies and alderflies). Although the tendency has been to classify these groups as distinct orders, they sometimes are placed in the order Neuroptera. Among the lepidopterans, members of the family   are more   than existing trichopterans (caddisflies). Although some entomologists treat them as a distinct order (Zeugloptera), others place them in the order Lepidoptera.

					 The   is an open one, with most of the body fluid, or hemolymph, occupying cavities of the body and its appendages. The one closed organ, called the dorsal  , extends from the hind end through the   to the head; it is a continuous tube with two regions, the   or pumping organ, which is restricted to the  , and the  , or conducting vessel, which extends forward through the thorax to the  . Hemolymph, pumped forward from the hind end and the sides of the body along the dorsal vessel, passes through a series of valved chambers, each containing a pair of lateral openings called  , to the aorta and is discharged in the front of the head. Accessory pumps carry the hemolymph through the wings and along the   and legs before it flows backward again to the abdomen. The circulating hemolymph, or  , is not important in respiration but functions in transporting nutrients to all parts of the body and metabolic waste products from the organs to the malpighian tubules for  . It contains free cells called hemocytes, most of which are phagocytes that help to protect the insect by devouring microorganisms. An important tissue bathed by the hemolymph is the  fat body, the main organ of intermediary metabolism. It serves for the storage of  ,  , and  , particularly during  . These materials are set free as required by the tissues for energy production or for growth and reproduction. The   consists of air-filled tubes or  tracheae, which open at the surface of the thorax and abdomen through paired  . The muscular valves of the spiracles, closed most of the time, open only to allow the uptake of   and the escape of  . The tracheal tubes are   with the   of the body surface. The tracheae are stiffened by spiral thickenings or threadlike ridges called taenidia, which branch repeatedly, becoming reduced in   and ending in fine thin-walled  tracheoles less than one micron in diameter. The tracheoles insinuate themselves between cells, sometimes appearing to penetrate into them, and push deeply into the  . Although movements of oxygen and carbon dioxide occur solely by gaseous   in sedentary insects, the system is ventilated mechanically in active  . Pumping movements of the abdomen provide the force necessary to drive out streams of air at some spiracles and suck them in at others. The taenidia keep the tracheae distended, thus allowing free passage of air. In addition, the most active insects have large thin-walled dilatations of the tracheae called  , which serve to increase the volume of air displaced during respiratory movements. Both   of oxygen and accumulation of carbon dioxide provide   to nerve centres that induce increased respiration during muscular activity. The reproductive system consists of the sex glands, or   (male   and female  ), the ducts through which the sexual products are carried to the exterior, and the accessory glands. The two testes are made up of a variable number of follicles in which the   mature and form packets of elongated spermatozoa. Spermatozoa, liberated in bundles with heads held in a cap of gelatinous material, accumulate in the vesicula seminalis, a dilated section of the male sexual duct (vas deferens). Each of the two ovaries consists of a number of  ovarioles. The ovarioles converge upon the two  , and the oviducts unite to form a common oviduct down which the ripe   are  . Each ovariole consists of a  germarium and a series of ovarial follicles. The germarium is a mass of undifferentiated cells that form  ,  nurse cells, and  . The nurse cells provide nourishment for the oocytes during the early stages of their growth; follicular cells, which invest the enlarging oocyte as a continuous epithelium, provide the materials for yolk formation and, in the final stages, lay down the eggshell or chorion. The ovarial follicles increase progressively in size as the oocytes grow to form ripe eggs. During  ,   of spermatozoa are sometimes introduced directly into the female vagina by means of the male copulatory organ, or  . Secretions from the accessory glands of the female activate the  , the sperm bundles disperse, and the free spermatozoa make their way up to the receptaculum seminis, or  , where they are stored, ready to fertilize the eggs. In most insects, the male accessory glands secrete materials that form a tough capsule, or  ; spermatozoa are encased in this spermatophore, which is inserted into the entrance of the vagina. The spermatophore walls commonly contain a gelatinous substance that swells upon exposure to secretions of the female and forces out the spermatozoa. The vagina serves both for receiving sperm and for laying eggs. The   segments of the abdomen of females sometimes are modified to form an   used for depositing eggs. In butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) a second copulatory canal independent of the vagina has been evolved, so that the sperm enter by one route, and the eggs are deposited by another. The  , or  , commonly provided with an air-filled meshwork, provides for respiration of the developing  . The chorion is also pierced by  , fine canals that permit entry of one or more spermatozoa for  . As the   passes down the oviduct before egg laying, the micropyles come to lie opposite the duct of the spermatheca; at this stage fertilization occurs. Eggs must be waterproof to prevent desiccation; each egg has a layer of waterproofing  , sometimes over the entire shell surface, more often lining the inside.

					 It generally is agreed that insect   evolved as   insects gradually adopted different modes of life from those of  . The characters of larva and adult became genetically independent; in response to  , therefore, each was able to evolve independently of the other. Mouthparts, limbs, and other morphological features were modified in different directions and in higher groups. Where these differences were extreme, an intermediate pupal stage evolved to bridge the morphological gap between larva and adult. It seems quite probable that the development of metamorphosis occurred more than once during the   of insects. Insects did not evolve in a constant  . Throughout geological time there were prodigious changes in climate; in addition, evolution was continuous among all other animals and plants. Geologically the selection pressures among insects were changing continuously. At the end of the   the first   plants appeared. Insect evolution has paralleled that of the flowering plants; they have evolved together. As   (butterflies and moths),   (ants, bees, and wasps),   (true flies), and   (beetles) began to feed upon  ,  , or  , flowering plants came to rely more and more upon insects—rather than upon the wind—for transferring their  . Flowers evolved nectaries, scents, and   colours as attractants for those insects that could effect cross- . Insects likewise evolved appropriate mouthpart modifications for extracting nectar from flowers. During the Mesozoic warm-blooded animals (  and  ) first appeared; by the dawn of the  , they had become predominant among Earth’s large animals. The warm fermenting excrement and the decaying dead bodies of mammals furnished excellent nutrient media for many insect larvae, notably among the Diptera and Coleoptera. The adults in both groups found their nourishment in flowers. Some heteropterans (true bugs) and dipterans pierce the skin of birds and mammals and feed on their  . The   (sucking lice) and the   (fleas) have become so specialized for this type of parasitic existence that their relationships to other insects are not   known with certainty. Evolution is occurring among present-day insects. They exhibit a balanced genetic  ; in other words, in response to small environmental changes, one genetic form, more successful than another, will become more plentiful. Sometimes there is no visible difference between these forms, the advantage presumably lying in some physiological change. It is advantageous for a   to have a   from which favourable characters can be selected so that the species can respond to environmental changes. Changes within a species may occur progressively over a large geographical area. Such a progressive genetic change is called a cline; in some cases insects at the extremes of the cline are so unlike that they are taken as separate species and may be infertile when crossed. One well-known example of evolution in action among insects is   (accumulation of the black pigment  ); many butterflies   industrial areas have become almost black, the black forms being more tolerant of   and less conspicuous to predators. Another example of this  cline type of evolution is the development of insect strains resistant to an   that has been applied heavily in an area for several years. In many parts of the world houseflies became highly resistant to  . The class Insecta is divided into orders on the basis of the structure of the  , including eyes,  , and antennae; the  , including legs and wings; and the  , including segmentation, spiracles, and appendages (cerci, styli, furcula). The genitalia and their accessory structures, usually located in the ninth abdominal segment, are important in  . Other taxonomic   include bristles (their form and arrangement are known as chaetotaxy), sensory receptors (spines, hairs, sensilla, tympanal organs), pattern of wing venation, and position of mouthparts. In addition, type of   and form of larva and   are used to distinguish insects.

Content: These five thinkers transformed Western philosophy and shaped its development from antiquity through the Middle Ages and beyond.  (c. 470–399 BCE) is a founding figure in the history of  , revered for his single-minded dedication to   and virtue, for his great argumentative skill, and for his death, which came to be viewed as a martyrdom. As a result of his public philosophizing in Athens, he was sentenced to death by the city’s democratic government for “impiety” and “corrupting the youth.” He could have saved himself by promising to cease philosophizing or by escaping into exile, but he refused, preferring to drink the deadly hemlock out of respect for the law. Beyond his reputation as a philosophical hero, Socrates is important for reorienting Greek philosophy toward ethical concerns and indeed for insisting that the cultivation of virtue, the “care of the soul,” is overwhelmingly the most important obligation of every human being. He famously asserted at his trial, in defiance of his accusers, that the unexamined life is not worth living. His penetrating style of exploring philosophical questions in conversation, typically exposing contradictions in the positions of his interlocutors, is called the Socratic method. *Socrates wrote nothing. *What is known of his views is inferred from, among other sources, the early dialogues of  , in which “Socrates” is the main character. *Socrates held that virtue is a kind of knowledge and that anyone who knows what virtue is cannot help but act virtuously.  (c. 428–c. 348 BCE) was by far the most gifted and accomplished of Socrates’ students. His thought was systematic, wide-ranging, profound, and extraordinarily influential, providing the foundation of ancient   and, through that school, guiding the development of early medieval philosophy and    . In later ages Platonic ideas influenced the development of 19th-century German   and 20th-century  . Since the late 19th century, Plato’s influence has been most pronounced in the  , where mathematical Platonism is a well-established tradition with many contemporary adherents. Plato’s foremost contribution to philosophy was his theory of  , which posited a realm of ideal, perfect, and changeless entities standing behind the world of ordinary experience. In addition to being a great philosopher, Plato was also a literary artist of the highest rank: he is a major figure in the history of  . *Plato’s philosophical works were written as dialogues, in most of which the principal character and main speaker is “Socrates.” *Plato himself never appears as a character in any of the dialogues. *Plato’s philosophy is the source of many famous literary tropes and myths, including the notion of Platonic love, the  , and the metaphor of the Cave (the world of experience is like a shadow cast on a cave wall by real but unseen objects).  (384–322 BCE), who follows   and   as the third member of the great triumvirate of ancient Greek philosophers, is arguably the most important thinker who ever lived. He made fundamental and pioneering contributions to every major field of philosophy, especially  ,  ,  , the  , the  ,  ,  , and  . He created the field of  , devising a system of reasoning known as   that was not superseded until the mid-19th century. He was in addition the first genuine empirical scientist in history, being the first person to distinguish the major scientific fields (including biology, botany, chemistry, embryology, physics, and zoology) and performing in all of them theoretical and observational work of lasting importance. Following the translation into Latin of his major works beginning about the 12th century, Aristotle’s philosophy eventually became the intellectual framework of later Western  , eclipsing (though not eliminating) the influence of Neoplatonism as passed through   and the  . Following the  , interest in the scientific aspects of Aristotle’s philosophy declined, and other aspects of his philosophy were only intermittently influential. Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, the field of  , a self-conscious revival of Aristotelian   (the theory of well-being), promised an approach to ethics grounded in human nature and free of the counterintuitive consequences of action-based ethical theories. Studies of Aristotle’s writings in ethics, metaphysics, and other fields continue to yield new insights into his thought. *Aristotle briefly served as tutor to the 13-year-old Macedonian  , the future ruler of the entire Greek world as well as North Africa and the Middle East. *Upon Alexander’s death in 323, Aristotle, because of his Macedonian birth and connections, fled Athens, saying that he did not wish the city that had killed Socrates “to sin twice against philosophy.” *All of Aristotle’s finished philosophical treatises are lost. The surviving works attributed to him consist of lecture notes and draft manuscripts. Their compact and abbreviated style contributes to the difficulty of his philosophy.  (354–430) was the preeminent Christian philosopher and theologian of late antiquity. His writings adapted aspects of   to the exposition and defense of Christian orthodoxy, imbuing those religious doctrines with philosophical sophistication and influencing the character of Western philosophy and theology for more than 1,000 years. Among Augustine’s most original and influential contributions to philosophy was his egocentric, or first-person, approach to philosophical questions, reflected in his response to   (“If I am mistaken, I am”), which anticipated the famous   (“I think, therefore I am”) of  . Augustine was also the first philosopher to clearly identify will as a distinct faculty of  . He maintained that the human will is free, and therefore that humans are   for their choices, but he also held that God has foreknowledge of the choices that humans freely make. In the  , he developed an argument for the existence of God that is strikingly similar to the   formulated by   more than 600 years later. A bishop of the Christian church in Roman North Africa, where he was born and spent almost all of his life, St. Augustine is recognized as philosophically the most important of the   (the bishops and other teachers who influenced the development of Christian doctrine during the church’s early centuries). *For 13 years Augustine maintained a monogamous relationship with a woman he did not marry; their son was born when Augustine was about 18 years old. *Augustine’s life coincided with the last century of the Western  . He died during a siege of Hippo by invading Vandals. *One of the most prolific authors in the history of philosophy, Augustine wrote more than 100 books and some 500 sermons, the vast majority of which have survived.  (c. 1224–74) was the greatest of the medieval   philosophers. Responding, as did others of his era, to the rediscovery of  ’s philosophy in the West through Latin translations of Aristotle’s Greek texts, Aquinas produced a comprehensive system of Christianized   that encompassed  ,  , cosmology,  ,  , philosophy of nature,  , and  . While insisting upon, and indeed demonstrating, the compatibility of the “new philosophy” with Christian doctrine, Aquinas also famously distinguished   and   by their different starting points. Although both are rational enterprises, involving a search for   guided by  , philosophy begins from general first principles about the world that any reflective person would accept, whereas theology starts with truths about God or the divine as revealed in Scripture, which can be accepted only on the basis of religious  . During Aquinas’s lifetime, aspects of his philosophy were resisted by more traditional theologians and formally rejected by the church. Some 50 years later, however, he was canonized a saint, and during the Renaissance he was pronounced a doctor of the church. In the late 19th century Pope   called for a return to Aquinas in the face of modernizing trends in both philosophy and science.   (the philosophy of Aquinas and his later interpreters) became the official philosophy of   in 1917, following a revision of the Code of Canon Law that required Catholic teachers of philosophy and religion to adopt Aquinas’s methods and principles. Later in the 20th century Thomism represented an important school of thought even outside Catholic philosophy, especially in ethics, the  , and political philosophy. *Aquinas joined the recently founded mendicant order of   in 1244, when he was about 20 years old. *While journeying to Paris to study, he was kidnapped by his family, who disapproved of his decision to join the  , and was then held at home against his will for about two years. During his detention his brothers engaged a prostitute to seduce him, an effort that was unsuccessful. *Aquinas abruptly abandoned writing in 1273 after undergoing an experience during mass that led him to regard all of his written work as “like straw.” He died three months later.

					 The insect thorax consists of three segments (called the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax), which may be fused but are usually recognizable. Each segment has four groups of hard plates (sclerites); the groups are the notum (upper), the pleura (sides), and the sternum (underside). Thoracic sclerites are located on a given segment by using an appropriate prefix (pro-, meso-, meta-); for example, the notum (upper sclerite) of the prothorax is the pronotum. Each segment bears a pair of legs, and, in the mature insect, the mesothorax and metathorax typically carry a pair of wings. Each leg always consists of five parts: a coxa   to the thorax, a small trochanter, a femur, a tibia, and a tarsus with one to five segments. The tarsal segments often carry claws with adhesive pads between them (arolia or pulvilli); these enable the insect to hold onto smooth surfaces. The legs may be modified for leaping, burrowing, grasping  , or swimming in various ways. The wings at rest may be extended permanently on each side, as in some   (Odonata), or held erect above the body, as in mayflies (Ephemeroptera); in most insects, however, they are folded against the abdomen. The wing consists of cuticular sacs that bud out from the wall of the thorax; the sacs become flattened during development, and the two membranes, pressed together, are stiffened by thickenings of the   that form cylindrical veins carrying tracheae, nerves, and circulating   to all parts of the wing. Wings   for flight commonly are made of thin membranous cuticle. In some insects, notably beetles (Coleoptera), the wings of the middle segment of the thorax have become thick and horny and serve as protective sheaths (elytra) of the membranous hindwings. The locomotion of insects is effected by   acting on the external skeleton. In leaping insects (e.g., grasshoppers, fleas) the force of muscle contraction is used to compress a pad of an elastic  ,  ; when the catch mechanism is released, the   in the protein molecule is used to project the insect into the air. Insect flight is achieved by flapping the wings; during these movements the wing blade, twisted as it passes from elevation to depression, produces the same effect as the rotating propeller of an aircraft. Muscles capable of changing this   control the direction of flight. The chief flight muscles control flight in one of two ways: in dragonflies, directly on a lever at the base of each wing; but, in most insects, indirectly by deforming the shape of the thorax. The longitudinal muscles of the thorax depress the wings that are articulated with it; the vertical muscles elevate them. In butterflies, the number of wing beats per second may be as low as 8 to 12, while the rate in mosquitoes may exceed 600. These rates can exceed the frequency of contraction and relaxation of muscles responding to nerves because the muscles, after they have begun contracting and relaxing, respond to the   elastic tension in the thoracic wall, where the frequency is determined by the natural periodic oscillation of the thorax. The flight of insects, despite their small size, conforms to the   laws that regulate the flight of aircraft. The abdomen consists of a maximum of 11 segments, although this number commonly is reduced by  . Appendages are usually absent except in caterpillars, which use up to five pairs of abdominal prolegs in walking, and in   insects where the appendages at the hind end have become transformed into external genitalia. In the male these genitalia are paired claspers used to hold the female; in the female, three pairs of valvulae are used to   eggs during oviposition. In some insects, notably crickets and cockroaches, two feelers, or cerci, at the hind end of the abdomen bear sense organs. The  requirements of insects are much the same as those of  —water, inorganic ions, and essential   (i.e., those that cannot be synthesized by the animal). The requirements for preformed   and   vary with the  . Although   of the B group are needed by insects, neither vitamins A nor D are required, and many insects can synthesize ascorbic acid ( ). On the other hand, insects cannot synthesize adequate quantities of  ; thus, in effect, cholesterol can be defined as a vitamin for insects. Insects that feed solely on some restricted diet (e.g.,   blood,   juices, refined flour) have special cells called  mycetocytes that harbour   microorganisms; these organisms, transmitted through the   to the next generation, benefit their host by furnishing it with an internal source of vitamins and perhaps other essential nutrients. If the symbiotic microorganisms are removed experimentally, an insect fails to grow if not provided with a diet rich in vitamins. The digestive system consists of a   formed from the   region (stomodaeum), a   formed similarly from the anal region (proctodaeum), and a   (mesenteron). The foregut and hindgut are lined by cuticle   with that on the body surface. The mouth is followed by the muscular  , which functions in sucking and swallowing, and the  , which may be enlarged to form a  . The crop discharges into the midgut, sometimes, as in cockroaches, by way of a muscular gizzard or proventriculus. The termination of the midgut is marked by the attachment of the  , the chief organs of  . The hindgut commonly consists of a narrow ileum followed by a larger and often thick-walled  , which discharges at the  . Digestive  , secreted not only by the   but also by the cells of the midgut and its  , vary with the diet of the insect. The most important     by the salivary glands is  ; the midgut secretes several enzymes including protease,  , amylase, and invertase. The products of   are absorbed chiefly in the midgut. The hindgut receives food residues from the midgut as well as waste products from the malpighian tubules. The end products of   metabolism are  , small amounts of amino acids, and  ; in aquatic insects, ammonium salts may be a major form for nitrogen excretion. In the rectum, the epithelial cells lining the gut wall often are enlarged, particularly in restricted areas where they form rectal glands. The epithelial cells of these glands are supplied richly with tracheae and function in the reabsorption of water and  . The rectal contents of insects that inhabit dry   commonly are reduced to dry fecal pellets prior to discharge. In many insects, particularly those which feed on relatively dry foods (e.g., beetles infesting stored grain), the upper segments of the malpighian tubules are bound by a sheath to the rectal surface and form a cryptonephridial system that serves to increase the capacity of the rectum for reabsorbing water and salts. The products of digestion, discharged into the hemocoele, or general body cavity, are transported by the circulatory fluid, or  , to the organs.

According to some early modern philosophical theories and commonsense views, minds are not   to scientific study because they are immaterial or supernatural, as are   and spirits (   ). Cognitive science, in contrast, treats the   as wholly material. It aims to collect   bearing on mental processes and phenomena and to develop theories that explain that evidence, which can come from many  . Psychologists, for example, collect behavioral evidence in studies of language comprehension,   making, social interaction, and emotional experience. Linguists systematically gather evidence about how people produce and understand sentences that are well-structured and meaningful. Neuroscientists use   and other techniques to investigate the neural activity that accompanies different kinds of thought. And anthropologists study the nature of cognition as it occurs in many different cultural  . The contributions of   and computer science to the investigation of cognition are primarily theoretical. Philosophy asks very general questions about the nature of knowledge ( ), reality ( ), and   ( ), among other topics. Many of these questions are directly relevant to how the mind works or to how it might work better. For example, a central epistemological question is how minds gain knowledge of the external world, and a central   question is whether mind and body are fundamentally different kinds of things.  has been very important in cognitive science for two reasons. First, the notion of computation has been invaluable for developing ideas about how thinking might be a natural process. Previously, scientific theories of the mind relied on clumsy and unproductive   with mechanical devices such as   and electronic  . The advent of   made it possible to see how a mechanical device could solve complex problems by manipulating symbols, or representations, according to algorithmic procedures (computations), generating productive analogies for how minds might work in similar ways.  Standard programming languages, for example, allowed for sequences of “IF…THEN…” instructions, which suggest a model of how people make plans (   ).  Second, computers themselves have been useful for testing scientific   about mental organization and functioning. A given   is modeled in a program by constructing   that mimic the entities and processes the hypothesis proposes. The program is then run on a computer, and if the computer’s output is similar in appropriate ways to real human performance, the hypothesis is considered to be supported.  theories of the mind are invaluable for guiding practice in many applied domains, including  , or   (   );   and  ; and  , in particular the design of tools and other devices that can be used effectively without placing excessive demands on people’s mental capacities (   ). Legal and medical reasoning (the reasoning involved in diagnosing and treating illness) also have been investigated by means of both psychological experiments and computational models. Cognitive science is particularly central to   because of the importance of   such as   and  , whose explanation and treatment require an understanding of the cognitive and neural processes that underlie the operations of healthy minds. Attempts to understand the mind can be traced to the ancient Greeks, most notably to   and  . Of the two, Aristotle was the more scientific, tying his theories about mental processes more closely to observation than to abstract speculation. With the rise of   in the 17th and 18th centuries, philosophers such as   and   attempted to develop accounts of mental operations that would be as objective as    , but their efforts were hampered by a lack of   experimental methods and theoretical ideas. Scientific psychology did not arise until the mid-19th century, when the German physiologist   and others developed more rigorous methods for conducting psychological experiments. In the 1920s and ’30s, much research in psychology and linguistics, among other  , was dominated by an ultraexperimental approach called  , which rejected theorizing about “invisible” mental processes and emphasized the formulation of general laws that govern observable  . By the late 1950s, however, it had become clear that behaviourists could not even explain how rats learn to run mazes much less how humans learn complex behaviours such as those involved in language use. The modern origins of cognitive science lie in the mid-1950s, when a brilliant group of interdisciplinary thinkers began to apply ideas from the theory of computation to the scientific explanation of human thought. The computer scientists and psychologists  ,  ,  , and   pioneered the new field of  , which was founded at an academic conference at   in 1956 with the ultimate aim of building computers and   that could perform tasks commonly associated with  . The psychologist   and the theoretical linguist   also developed computational   to behaviourist theories in their fields. These six figures have since been recognized as the founders of cognitive science. The term itself, however, was not coined until the 1970s, when the interdisciplinary field became more formally organized. During this period the Cognitive Science Society and the journal   were founded, and programs and departments of cognitive science were established at many universities. By the late 20th century, cognitive science had become a flourishing academic enterprise with hundreds of departments throughout the world and numerous international societies, journals, and conferences.

					 The insect   has many gaps. Among the primitive apterygotes, only the collembolans ( ) have been found as fossils in the   (about 419.2 million to 358.9 million years ago). Ten insect orders are known as fossils, mostly of Late   and   times (318 million to 251 million years ago). No fossils have yet been found from the Late Devonian (about 382.7 million to 358.9 million years ago) or Early Carboniferous (about 358.9 million to 318 million years ago) period, when the key characters of present-day insects are believed to have evolved; thus, early evolution must be inferred from the   of   insects. It has become evident that insect  , like that of other animals, was far more active at some periods than at others. There have been geological epochs of “explosive” evolution during which many new forms have appeared. Those epochs may have followed some modification or   in body function, or new developments favoured by climatic changes or evolutionary advances of other   and  . During those periods of evolutionary change, new methods of feeding and living led to   of insect   and limbs, the origin of  , and other changes. The simplified family tree shown here illustrates the presumed evolutionary history of winged insects ( ) throughout the geological periods from the Devonian to the Recent. The apterygotes, which are regarded as survivors of primitive insect stock, are omitted from the family tree. Dark lines indicate the periods during which the various orders have been found as fossils. Some lines stop at the names of orders now extinct and known only as fossils. Light lines indicate the   origin of various orders. Many insect types, traces of which have not yet been discovered, must have been produced during the explosive periods of evolution in   and Permian times. The primitive wingless insects gave rise to a paleopterous stock. Descendants of this stock included ancient fossil types that flourished in Permian times, such as the giant dragonflies or   (some of which had a wing span of more than half a metre) and the dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) and mayflies (Ephemeroptera), both of which have   with little change to the present. The primitive insect stock also gave rise to a neopterous stock, believed to include the progenitors of the remaining insect orders. The Orthoptera (grasshoppers) and the   ( ) have been found as fossils even in late Carboniferous times. The   ( , sometimes placed in the order Blattodea),   ( ), and   ( ), though doubtless of ancient origin, have not been found yet as fossils dated earlier than the   (252 million to 66 million years ago). The evolutionary radiation believed to have given rise to the orders listed above in the Middle Carboniferous Period is thought to have also produced a paraneopterous stock, which formed the base for a new evolutionary radiation during the  . Present-day derivatives of this stock evolved into the   ( ),   ( ),   or Siphunculata ( ), Thysanoptera ( ),   (true bugs), and   (e.g., aphids). Several phylogenetic lines are exopterygote—i.e., insects with simple  , some of which, such as Mallophaga and Anoplura, are secondarily wingless. The remaining orders are endopterygote (insects with complete metamorphosis). They are shown in the family tree as derivatives of an oligoneopterous stock, which gave rise to   ( ),   (ants, wasps, and bees), and   (beetles) in the Early Permian Period (298.9 million to 272.3 million years ago); the early ancestry of these orders is obscure, however, and the earliest fossils closely resemble present-day forms. One line from the evolutionary radiation at the beginning of the Permian gave rise to a mecopteroid stock, and there is good evidence that a sub-radiation of these mecopteroid orders (sometimes called the panorpoid complex) provided the origin for the present   ( ),   (true flies),   (fleas),   (caddisflies), and   (butterflies and moths). Insect wings develop as paired outgrowths from the  , stiffened by ribs, or veins, in which run tracheae. These tracheae follow a consistent pattern throughout the Pterygota, and their specific modifications (known as  ) are important in   and in estimations of the degree of relationship between groups. The basic consistency of venation suggests that wings have been evolved only once among the insects; that is, all the Pterygota arose from a single stem in the family tree. By the time fossil insects are found (toward the end of the Carboniferous), wings are developed fully. In the   the wings are held aloft above the back, as in mayflies, or held extended permanently on each side of the body, as in dragonflies. Throughout the   there is a wing-flexing mechanism (secondarily lost in butterflies) that enables the wings to be folded back to rest on the surface of the  . Winged insects must have made their appearance very early in the Carboniferous, but there is no fossil evidence to show the way they evolved. One   is that wings arose as fixed planes extending sideways from the thorax and that these planes were used, perhaps in some large leaping insect, for gliding. Later muscles developed, first to control inclination and then to move the wings in flapping flight. Another hypothesis is that wings may have originated from large thoracic    , similar to the movable tracheal gills along the abdomen of some    . Such outgrowths could have been useful to insects exposed by the drying up of a temporary aquatic habitat and might have carried them in rain-bearing winds to a new watery home. It is likely that the most primitive symphylan-like insects were terrestrial. Throughout insect evolution, however, independent   to aquatic habitats have occurred. Usually the pattern is one in which the adults leave the water and disperse. Many pterygote insects have become secondarily wingless, sometimes as single   or groups of species within large orders and sometimes as entire orders (the parasitic  , Mallophaga and Anoplura, and the fleas, Siphonaptera).

					 Both in complexity of behaviour and learning capacity,   wasps and bees are the equals of social wasps or honeybees. Social insects, however, have developed a   in which the members must do the work required at the proper time. If the society is to succeed, its needs must be communicated to the individual members, and those individuals must act accordingly. These needs may be met by a temporary change in the behaviour of existing individuals, or they may result in developmental changes that vary the number of individuals in the various castes (e.g., new queens, males, workers, or soldiers). Commonly, both behavioral and developmental changes are initiated by  , chemical messengers that   information from one member of a colony to another. Insect societies are gigantic families, with all individuals being the offspring of a single female. In the   the single   in the hive secretes a   known as the   (oxodecenoic acid), which is taken up by the workers and passed throughout the colony by food sharing. So long as the queen substance is present, all members are informed that the queen is healthy. If the workers are deprived of queen substance, they proceed at once to build queen cells and feed the young   with a special   known as   that results in the production of new queens. All termites and ants and some   of wasps and bees are the only insect groups containing truly social species. However, there are many other species that exhibit some lesser degree of interaction among individuals. Insects feed on every sort of organic matter, and their methods of feeding and   have become modified accordingly. The major climatic   faced by terrestrial insects are   extremes and desiccation. Different species function best at various optimal temperatures. If conditions are too hot, an insect seeks out a cool, moist, and shady spot. If exposed to the sun on a hot day, an insect will position itself so as to present the smallest amount of body surface to the heat. If conditions are too cool, insects will remain in the sun to warm themselves. Many butterflies must spread their wings and expose the large surface to the sun like solar collectors to warm the flight muscles before they can  . Many moths can raise their temperature by vibrating their wings or “shivering” before taking flight. The heat generated in this way is conserved by   or scales that maintain an insulating layer of air around the body. The optimum muscle temperature for flight is from 38 to 40 °C (100 to 104 °F). In extremely cold weather the danger for insects is freezing, and insects that survive winters in cold latitudes are called cold hardy. A few insects (e.g., some caterpillars and aquatic   larvae) tolerate   in body fluids, although it is probable that the cell contents do not freeze. In most insects, however, cold hardiness means resistance to freezing. This resistance results partly from accumulation of large quantities of   as an antifreeze and partly from physical changes in the   that permit supercooling to temperatures far below the   of water without the blood freezing. Preventing water loss is another important aspect of life in terrestrial  . All insects have a waxy ( ) layer that coats the outer surface of the   to prevent water loss from the body wall. In addition, most terrestrial insects also have   to avoid water loss through respiration and waste  . Major changes required for life in an aquatic habitat include modifications of the legs for swimming and adaptations for respiration. Most aquatic insects swim using the second or third (or both) pairs of legs. In some, the distal (away from the body) leg segments may simply be flattened and serve as oars. In others, there is a row of movable hairs on these segments that fold against the leg to offer less resistance during the forward stroke and then extend out, forming an oarlike surface during the power stroke. In some, like the water striders (Gerridae), long thin legs allow them to “walk” on the surface film of ponds and streams. To breathe, some insects simply rise to the water surface and take atmospheric air into their tracheal systems. Mosquito larvae use only the last pair of abdominal spiracles, which open at the tip of a respiratory  .   (e.g.,  ) have converted the space between the protective sheaths on the hind wings (elytra) and the   into an air-storage chamber. Air-breathing insects can prolong the period of submergence by trapping air among their surface hairs. This air film acts as a physical   and makes possible oxygen uptake from water. Other adaptations to an aquatic   have occurred in larvae that obtain all their   directly from the water. In midge larvae, abundant   (breathing tubes) contact the entire thin cuticle.   (Trichoptera) and   (Ephemeroptera) larvae have tracheal gills on the abdomen or  . In   larvae, the gills are inside the rectum, and the water is pumped in and out through the  , whereas   have external rectal gills. Insects may   some protection from the horny or leathery cuticle but may also have various chemical defenses. Some caterpillars have special irritating hairs, which break up into barbed fragments that contain a   substance that causes intense itching and serves as a protection against many  . Dermal glands of many insects discharge repellent or poisonous secretions over the cuticle, whereas others are protected by poisons that are present continuously in the blood and tissues. Such poisons often are derived from the plants on which the insects feed. In many hymenopterans (ants, bees, wasps) accessory glands in the female reproductive system have become modified to produce toxic proteins. These poisons, injected into the   of the  , paralyze it. In this state the prey serves as food for the   larva. Stings are also used by hymenopterans, including ants, wasps, and bees, for self-defense. Concealment is an important protective device for insects. For some, this may be accomplished by simply hiding beneath stones or the bark of  . However, many species rely on some forms of protective  . Protective coloration may take the form of   (cryptic coloration) in which the insect blends into its background. The coloration of many insects copies a specific background with extraordinary detail. Stick insects ( ) can change their colour to match that of the background by moving pigment granules in their epidermal cells. Some caterpillars also have patterns that develop in response to a background, although these are irreversible. Insects such as caterpillars, which rely on cryptic coloration, often combine it with a rigid deathlike position. Alternatively, insects that have well-developed chemical defenses generally show   warning (aposematic) coloration. Experiments have proved that predators such as birds quickly learn to associate such coloration “labels” with nauseous or dangerous prey. Finally, insects without nauseous qualities may gain protection by  —developing a conspicuous colour pattern similar to that found in distasteful species. The factors that limit the numbers of insect species are complex. Experimental studies of a population of grain beetles in a container of   show that the complexities increase if a second species is added. With insects in natural habitats,   not only with members of their own species but with numerous other species as well, the obstacles to survival become increasingly great. Competition among species is reduced to some extent by specialization of species to  , or habitats, for which other insects do not compete. Formerly, controversy arose over whether numbers were always density dependent (i.e., limited by the density of the species itself) or whether catastrophic actions, notably the vagaries of weather, were of prime importance. It has since become generally thought that the ultimate factor in the control of numbers is competition within the species for food and other needs. However, in many circumstances, before competition for food becomes significant, numbers are reduced by external factors. Competition within a species is often reduced by wholesale   to new localities. Migration may occur by active flight or, as in aphids and locusts, largely directed by the wind. Another important factor in the regulation of populations is balanced   of species, in which the prevalence of individuals with given characteristics changes according to the action of   as the state of the   changes. The insect is covered by the cuticle, a layer of inert material laid down by a single sheet of epidermal cells. It consists mainly of  , a carbohydrate also known as polyacetylglucosamine, and  , a hard substance composed of   tanned by  . The cuticle, which has an outer layer of waterproofing   to prevent loss of water by  , also serves as the   to which the   are attached. In insects such as caterpillars, in which the cuticle is soft and flexible, the skeleton is of the hydrostatic type. In this type, body fluid pressure, maintained by muscle   beneath the body wall, provides the firmness necessary for the function of muscles involved in movement. In insects with hard bodies, the cuticle is made up of hardened areas called   that are connected by flexible joints. At the back of the head and in the thorax, hardened ingrowths of the cuticle, known as apodemes, furnish a kind of internal skeleton for muscular attachment. Insect colours depend partly on   incorporated in the cuticle. However, the most important pigments often occur in epidermal cells below the cuticle. In butterflies and moths, pigments may be deposited in flattened hairs, or scales, covering the wings. Some of the most brilliant insect colours are not the result of pigmentation but are physical interference colours produced by fine laminae (grooves or pits) in the surface of the wing scales or the cuticle itself. The ancestors of insects most likely had bodies consisting of many similar segments with only minor aggregation of the nervous system in the   (head) segment. These primitive insect ancestors probably looked something like modern  , with a pair of appendages on each body segment but without a well-developed head. In present-day insects the primitive segments are grouped into three regions known as the head, thorax, and abdomen. The first six primitive segments have fused to form the head, and the appendages of these segments have become modified into antennae that bear numerous sense organs and   that convey food to the mouth. Eyes also are prominent on the head. In most insects the mouthparts, adapted for  , consist of several parts; behind the upper lip or labrum is a pair of hard, toothed  . These are followed by a pair of structures called first  , each consisting of a bladelike lacinia, a hoodlike galea, and a segmented palp   sense organ. The paired second maxillae are partly fused in the midline to form the lower lip, or  . Sometimes a median tonguelike structure, called the  , arises from the floor of the mouth. Insect mouthparts have been modified strikingly and reflect particular methods of feeding. The dipterans (true flies) provide instructive examples. In the primitive bloodsucking flies (e.g., the    ) the mandibles and maxillae form serrated blades that cut through the skin and   of the host  . The  epipharynx and hypopharynx are elongated and grooved so that, when apposed, they form a tube for sucking blood. The tonguelike labium is used for   exposed fluids. Dipteran mouthparts have evolved in two directions. In the   (Culicidae) the mandibles, maxillae, epipharynx, and hypopharynx have become exceedingly slender stylets that form a fine bundle and are used for piercing skin and entering blood vessels. The labium, elongated and deeply grooved, serves only as a sheath for the stylet bundle. In the    , however, mandibles and maxillae have been lost; the tonguelike labium alone remains and serves for feeding on exposed surfaces. Certain flies related to   have reacquired a capacity to suck blood; however, since they have lost both mandibles and maxillae, a new bloodsucking mechanism has developed. Labial teeth have evolved for cutting through the skin, and the labium itself is plunged into the tissues. The     has an arrangement of this kind. In the    , the labium has become a fine, needlelike structure normally protected by a sheath formed from the palps of the lost maxillae. Other mouthpart modifications of the mouthpart components provide the cutting and sucking mouthparts of fleas (Siphonaptera), plant-sucking insects (Homoptera), bloodsucking bugs (Heteroptera), honeybees (Hymenoptera), and nectar-feeding butterflies (Lepidoptera).

					 The   consists of a series of   that supply nerves to successive segments of the body. The three main ganglia in the   (protocerebrum, deutocerebrum, and tritocerebrum) commonly are fused to form the  , or supraesophageal ganglion. The rest of the ganglionic chain lies below the   against the ventral body surface. The brain is joined by paired connectives to the subesophageal ganglion, which is linked in turn by paired connectives to the three thoracic and eight abdominal ganglia (numbered according to segment). In most insects the number of separate ganglia has been reduced by  . The last abdominal ganglion always serves several segments. In homopterans and heteropterans all the abdominal ganglia usually fuse with mesothoracic and metathoracic ganglia; and in the   of higher flies (Cyclorrhapha), the ganglia of the brain,  , and   form one mass. Each ganglion is made up of   bodies that lie on the   and a mass of nerve fibres, the neuropile, that occupies the centre. There are two types of nerve cells,   and  association neurons. Motor neurons have main processes, or  , that extend from the ganglia to contractile muscles, and minor processes, or  , that connect with the  . Association neurons, usually smaller than motor neurons, are linked with other parts of the   by way of the neuropile. Cell bodies of the sense organs, called  , lie at the periphery of the body just below the  . Sensory neurons occur as single cells or small   of cells; the distal process, or dendrite, of each cell extends to a cuticular sense organ ( ). The sensilla are usually small hairs modified for perception of specific stimuli (e.g., touch, smell, taste, heat, cold); each sensillum consists of one sense cell and one  . Although these small sense organs occur all over the body, they are particularly abundant in  , palps, and cerci. The sense cell of each sensillum gives off a proximal process, or sensory axon, which runs inward to the central nervous system, where it enters the neuropile and makes contact with the endings of association neurons. Bundles of both sensory axons and motor axons, which are enclosed in protective membranous sheaths,   the nerves.    may be sensitive enough to perceive air vibrations and thus serve as organs for  . Tympanal organs (eardrums) are present in certain butterflies and grasshoppers. Mechanical sensilla (chordotonal organs) below the surface of the cuticle serve for perception of internal strains and body movements. The eyes are of two kinds, simple eyes, or  , and  . In the adults of higher insects both types are present. The visual sense cells are derived from the epidermis, as are those of other sense organs, and are connected to the optic ganglia (a part of the brain) by sensory axons. Each visual sense cell has a zone at its surface, which, on exposure to  , gives rise to chemical products that stimulate the sense cell, called the  retinula cell, and initiate the nerve impulse in the sensory axon. The light-receptive zone, or  , of the retinula cell commonly has a rodlike form; because it lies perpendicular to the surface, light passes lengthwise along it. In the simple eyes (ocelli) a lens-shaped area of cuticle lies over the group of retinula cells that form the  . Since the optical structure is primitive, the visual image received is crude; ocelli can perceive only light, darkness, and movement. The   eye, made up of a number of facets, resembles a honeycomb; each facet overlies a group of six or seven retinal cells that surround the rhabdom. Each of the retinal units below a single facet is termed an ommatidium. The number of facets varies. For example, there are only a few dozen facets in the eye of the primitive    , while the eye of the     has some 4,000, and the highly developed eye of the   may contain up to 28,000. During  , rays from a small area of the field of view fall on a single facet and are concentrated upon the rhabdom of the retinula cells below. Since each point of light differs in brightness, all the   that form the retina receive a crude mosaic of the field of view. Unlike the image in a   or in  , the mosaic image in the compound eye is not inverted but erect. The fineness of the mosaic and, therefore, the degree of   improves with increasing numbers of facets. It is estimated that the eye of the   has visual   equal to 1 percent that of humans. Each ommatidium commonly is shielded by a curtain of pigmented cells that prevent the spread of light to neighbouring ommatidia. This is called an  . In the eyes of insects that   at night or in twilight, however, the pigment can be withdrawn so that light received from neighbouring facets overlaps to some extent. This is called a  . The image formed is brighter but not as sharp as that formed by the apposition eye. In addition to perceiving brightness, the eyes of insects can perceive colour as well as some other properties of light. The most   insects known are found as   in rocks of the Middle   (393.3 million to 382.7 million years ago). The bodies of those insects were divided then, as now, into a head bearing one pair of antennae, a thorax with three pairs of legs, and a segmented abdomen. Those insects originated with the terrestrial branch of the phylum  . The Arthropoda, whose origin is thus far unknown, probably arose in  , perhaps as many as 1 billion years ago. Some arthropods colonized the open sea and have become the present-day class   (crabs, shrimps) and the now-extinct Trilobita. Other arthropods colonized the land. This   line persists chiefly as the classes Onychophora,   (spiders, scorpions, ticks), the   (consisting of   [millipedes],  ,  , and  , or centipedes), and finally the class Insecta. The most primitive insects today are found among the wingless (apterous) hexapods; sometimes known collectively as  , they include  , thysanurans,  , and collembolans. It is agreed generally that insects are related most closely to the   group, among which the Symphyla exhibit most of the essential features required for the ancestral insect form (i.e., a Y-shaped epicranial suture, two pairs of maxillae, a single pair of antennae, styli and sacs on the abdominal segments, cerci, and malpighian tubules). There is, therefore, general agreement that the insects probably arose from an early symphylan-like form.

					 Most insects begin their lives as fertilized eggs. The  , or  , is commonly pierced by respiratory openings that lead to an air-filled meshwork inside the shell. For some insects (e.g.,   and  ) a batch of eggs is cemented together to form an   or ootheca. Insects may pass unfavourable seasons in the egg stage. Eggs of the     (Collembola) and of some grasshoppers (Orthoptera) pass summer   in a dry shrivelled state and resume development when moistened. Most eggs, however, retain their water although they may pass the winter in a state of arrested development, or  , usually at some early stage in embryonic development. However, dried eggs of   mosquitoes enter a state of dormancy after development is complete and quickly hatch when placed in water. The hatching of young   is achieved in several ways. Some, such as  , bite their way out of the egg. Many, such as the  , have   spines with which they cut a slit in the shell. Some insect eggs have a preformed “escape cap” that the larva pops from the shell by increasing the pressure inside the egg. Depending on the  , this may be accomplished either by swallowing air and then constricting   in the body to   pressure on the cap or by having an expandable region on the   (many   have a ptilinum) that can be extended by hydraulic (blood) pressure. After hatching, the larva continues to distend itself in this way, although the ptilinum collapses back into the body, until the   hardens. Once formed, the insect cuticle cannot grow. Growth can occur only by a series of molts ( ) during which new and larger cuticles form and old cuticles are shed. Molting makes possible large changes in body form. In the most primitive wingless insects ( ) such as the    , there is almost no change in form throughout growth to the  . These are known as   insects. Among insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), true bugs (Heteroptera), and homopterans (e.g.,  , scale insects), the general form is constant until the final  , when the larva undergoes substantial changes in body form to become a winged adult with fully developed genitalia. These insects, called hemimetabolous, are said to undergo  . The higher orders of insects, including   (butterflies and moths),   (beetles),   (ants, wasps, and bees), Diptera (true flies), and several others, are called   because larvae are totally unlike adults. These larvae undergo a series of molts with little change in form before they enter into complete  , which includes molting first into   and then into fully winged adults. Larvae, which vary considerably in shape, are classified in five forms:  eruciform (caterpillar-like),  scarabaeiform (grublike),  campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active),  elateriform (wireworm-like), and   (maggot-like). The three types of pupae are:  , with appendages more or less glued to the body;  , with the appendages free and not glued to the body; and  coarctate, which is essentially exarate but remaining covered by the cast skins (exuviae) of the next to the last larval instar (name given to the form of an insect between molts).

					 The   is an open one, with most of the body fluid, or hemolymph, occupying cavities of the body and its appendages. The one closed organ, called the dorsal  , extends from the hind end through the   to the head; it is a continuous tube with two regions, the   or pumping organ, which is restricted to the  , and the  , or conducting vessel, which extends forward through the thorax to the  . Hemolymph, pumped forward from the hind end and the sides of the body along the dorsal vessel, passes through a series of valved chambers, each containing a pair of lateral openings called  , to the aorta and is discharged in the front of the head. Accessory pumps carry the hemolymph through the wings and along the   and legs before it flows backward again to the abdomen. The circulating hemolymph, or  , is not important in respiration but functions in transporting nutrients to all parts of the body and metabolic waste products from the organs to the malpighian tubules for  . It contains free cells called hemocytes, most of which are phagocytes that help to protect the insect by devouring microorganisms. An important tissue bathed by the hemolymph is the  fat body, the main organ of intermediary metabolism. It serves for the storage of  ,  , and  , particularly during  . These materials are set free as required by the tissues for energy production or for growth and reproduction. The   consists of air-filled tubes or  tracheae, which open at the surface of the thorax and abdomen through paired  . The muscular valves of the spiracles, closed most of the time, open only to allow the uptake of   and the escape of  . The tracheal tubes are   with the   of the body surface. The tracheae are stiffened by spiral thickenings or threadlike ridges called taenidia, which branch repeatedly, becoming reduced in   and ending in fine thin-walled  tracheoles less than one micron in diameter. The tracheoles insinuate themselves between cells, sometimes appearing to penetrate into them, and push deeply into the  . Although movements of oxygen and carbon dioxide occur solely by gaseous   in sedentary insects, the system is ventilated mechanically in active  . Pumping movements of the abdomen provide the force necessary to drive out streams of air at some spiracles and suck them in at others. The taenidia keep the tracheae distended, thus allowing free passage of air. In addition, the most active insects have large thin-walled dilatations of the tracheae called  , which serve to increase the volume of air displaced during respiratory movements. Both   of oxygen and accumulation of carbon dioxide provide   to nerve centres that induce increased respiration during muscular activity. The reproductive system consists of the sex glands, or   (male   and female  ), the ducts through which the sexual products are carried to the exterior, and the accessory glands. The two testes are made up of a variable number of follicles in which the   mature and form packets of elongated spermatozoa. Spermatozoa, liberated in bundles with heads held in a cap of gelatinous material, accumulate in the vesicula seminalis, a dilated section of the male sexual duct (vas deferens). Each of the two ovaries consists of a number of  ovarioles. The ovarioles converge upon the two  , and the oviducts unite to form a common oviduct down which the ripe   are  . Each ovariole consists of a  germarium and a series of ovarial follicles. The germarium is a mass of undifferentiated cells that form  ,  nurse cells, and  . The nurse cells provide nourishment for the oocytes during the early stages of their growth; follicular cells, which invest the enlarging oocyte as a continuous epithelium, provide the materials for yolk formation and, in the final stages, lay down the eggshell or chorion. The ovarial follicles increase progressively in size as the oocytes grow to form ripe eggs. During  ,   of spermatozoa are sometimes introduced directly into the female vagina by means of the male copulatory organ, or  . Secretions from the accessory glands of the female activate the  , the sperm bundles disperse, and the free spermatozoa make their way up to the receptaculum seminis, or  , where they are stored, ready to fertilize the eggs. In most insects, the male accessory glands secrete materials that form a tough capsule, or  ; spermatozoa are encased in this spermatophore, which is inserted into the entrance of the vagina. The spermatophore walls commonly contain a gelatinous substance that swells upon exposure to secretions of the female and forces out the spermatozoa. The vagina serves both for receiving sperm and for laying eggs. The   segments of the abdomen of females sometimes are modified to form an   used for depositing eggs. In butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) a second copulatory canal independent of the vagina has been evolved, so that the sperm enter by one route, and the eggs are deposited by another. The  , or  , commonly provided with an air-filled meshwork, provides for respiration of the developing  . The chorion is also pierced by  , fine canals that permit entry of one or more spermatozoa for  . As the   passes down the oviduct before egg laying, the micropyles come to lie opposite the duct of the spermatheca; at this stage fertilization occurs. Eggs must be waterproof to prevent desiccation; each egg has a layer of waterproofing  , sometimes over the entire shell surface, more often lining the inside.

A common goal in defining any   concept is a statement that corresponds to common usage. Acceptance of that aim, however, entails some peril. It implicitly assumes that common language categorizes in scientifically meaningful ways; that the word  , for example, corresponds to a definite psychological process. However, there appears to be good reason to doubt the validity of this assumption. The phenomena of learning are so varied and   that their inclusion in a single category may not be warranted. Recognizing this danger (and the   that no definition of learning is likely to be totally satisfactory) a definition proposed in 1961 by G.A.  Kimble may be considered representative: Learning is a relatively permanent change in a behavioral   that occurs as a result of reinforced practice. Although the definition is useful, it still leaves problems. The definition may be helpful by indicating that the change need not be an improvement; addictions and   are learned as well as high-level skills and useful knowledge. The phrase relatively permanent serves to exclude temporary behavioral changes that may depend on such factors as fatigue, the effects of drugs, or alterations in motives. The word potentiality covers effects that do not appear at once; one might learn about tourniquets by reading a first-aid manual and put the information to use later. To say that learning occurs as a result of practice excludes the effects of physiological development, aging, and brain damage. The stipulation that practice must be   serves to distinguish learning from the opposed loss of unreinforced habits. Reinforcement objectively refers to any condition—often reward or punishment—that may promote learning. However, the definition raises difficulties. How permanent is relatively permanent? Suppose one looks up an address, writes it on an envelope, but five minutes later has to look it up again to be sure it is correct. Does this qualify as relatively permanent? While commonly accepted as learning, it seems to violate the definition. What exactly is the result that occurs with practice? Is it a change in the  ? Is it a matter of providing stimuli that can evoke responses they previously would not? Does it mean developing associations, gaining insights, or gaining new perspective? Such questions serve to distinguish Kimble’s descriptive definition from theoretical attempts to define learning by identifying the nature of its underlying process. These may be neurophysiological, perceptual, or associationistic; they begin to   theoretical issues and to identify the bases for and   of learning. (The processes of perceptual learning are treated in the article  .) Even the simplest animals display such primitive forms of adaptive activity as  , the elimination of practiced responses. For example, a paramecium can learn to escape from a narrow glass tube to get to food. Learning in this case consists of the elimination (habituation) of unnecessary movements. Habituation also has been demonstrated for mammals in which control normally exercised by higher (brain) centres has been impaired by severing the  . For example, repeated application of   to the paw of a cat so treated leads to habituation of the reflex   reaction. Whether single-celled animals or cats that function only through the spinal cord are capable of higher forms of learning is a matter of controversy. Sporadic reports that conditioned responses may be possible among such animals have been sharply debated. At higher evolutionary levels the range of phenomena called learning is more extensive. Many mammalian species display the following varieties of learning. This is the form of learning studied by   (1849–1936). Some neutral  , such as a bell, is presented just before delivery of some effective stimulus (say, food or acid placed in the mouth of a dog). A response such as salivation, originally   only by the effective stimulus, eventually appears when the initially neutral stimulus is presented. The response is said to have become conditioned. Classical conditioning seems easiest to establish for involuntary reactions mediated by the  . This indicates learning to obtain reward or to avoid punishment. Laboratory examples of such conditioning among small mammals or birds are common. Rats or pigeons may be taught to press levers for food; they also learn to avoid or terminate electric shock. In the form of learning called chaining the subject is required to make a series of responses in a definite order. For example, a sequence of correct turns in a maze is to be mastered, or a list of words is to be learned in specific sequence. Within limits, laboratory animals can be taught to regulate the force with which they press a lever or to control the speed at which they run down an alley. Such skills are learned when a reward is made   on quantitatively constrained performance. Among human learners complex, precise skills (  tying shoelaces) are routine. In   learning the subject is reinforced to respond only to selected sensory characteristics of stimuli.   that can be established in this way may be quite subtle. Pigeons, for example, can learn to discriminate differences in colours that are indistinguishable to human beings without the use of special devices. An organism is said to have learned a concept when it responds uniquely to all objects or events in a given logical class as distinct from other classes. Even geese can master such concepts as roundness and triangularity; after training, they can respond appropriately to round or triangular figures they have never seen before.

According to some early modern philosophical theories and commonsense views, minds are not   to scientific study because they are immaterial or supernatural, as are   and spirits (   ). Cognitive science, in contrast, treats the   as wholly material. It aims to collect   bearing on mental processes and phenomena and to develop theories that explain that evidence, which can come from many  . Psychologists, for example, collect behavioral evidence in studies of language comprehension,   making, social interaction, and emotional experience. Linguists systematically gather evidence about how people produce and understand sentences that are well-structured and meaningful. Neuroscientists use   and other techniques to investigate the neural activity that accompanies different kinds of thought. And anthropologists study the nature of cognition as it occurs in many different cultural  . The contributions of   and computer science to the investigation of cognition are primarily theoretical. Philosophy asks very general questions about the nature of knowledge ( ), reality ( ), and   ( ), among other topics. Many of these questions are directly relevant to how the mind works or to how it might work better. For example, a central epistemological question is how minds gain knowledge of the external world, and a central   question is whether mind and body are fundamentally different kinds of things.  has been very important in cognitive science for two reasons. First, the notion of computation has been invaluable for developing ideas about how thinking might be a natural process. Previously, scientific theories of the mind relied on clumsy and unproductive   with mechanical devices such as   and electronic  . The advent of   made it possible to see how a mechanical device could solve complex problems by manipulating symbols, or representations, according to algorithmic procedures (computations), generating productive analogies for how minds might work in similar ways.  Standard programming languages, for example, allowed for sequences of “IF…THEN…” instructions, which suggest a model of how people make plans (   ).  Second, computers themselves have been useful for testing scientific   about mental organization and functioning. A given   is modeled in a program by constructing   that mimic the entities and processes the hypothesis proposes. The program is then run on a computer, and if the computer’s output is similar in appropriate ways to real human performance, the hypothesis is considered to be supported.  theories of the mind are invaluable for guiding practice in many applied domains, including  , or   (   );   and  ; and  , in particular the design of tools and other devices that can be used effectively without placing excessive demands on people’s mental capacities (   ). Legal and medical reasoning (the reasoning involved in diagnosing and treating illness) also have been investigated by means of both psychological experiments and computational models. Cognitive science is particularly central to   because of the importance of   such as   and  , whose explanation and treatment require an understanding of the cognitive and neural processes that underlie the operations of healthy minds. Attempts to understand the mind can be traced to the ancient Greeks, most notably to   and  . Of the two, Aristotle was the more scientific, tying his theories about mental processes more closely to observation than to abstract speculation. With the rise of   in the 17th and 18th centuries, philosophers such as   and   attempted to develop accounts of mental operations that would be as objective as    , but their efforts were hampered by a lack of   experimental methods and theoretical ideas. Scientific psychology did not arise until the mid-19th century, when the German physiologist   and others developed more rigorous methods for conducting psychological experiments. In the 1920s and ’30s, much research in psychology and linguistics, among other  , was dominated by an ultraexperimental approach called  , which rejected theorizing about “invisible” mental processes and emphasized the formulation of general laws that govern observable  . By the late 1950s, however, it had become clear that behaviourists could not even explain how rats learn to run mazes much less how humans learn complex behaviours such as those involved in language use. The modern origins of cognitive science lie in the mid-1950s, when a brilliant group of interdisciplinary thinkers began to apply ideas from the theory of computation to the scientific explanation of human thought. The computer scientists and psychologists  ,  ,  , and   pioneered the new field of  , which was founded at an academic conference at   in 1956 with the ultimate aim of building computers and   that could perform tasks commonly associated with  . The psychologist   and the theoretical linguist   also developed computational   to behaviourist theories in their fields. These six figures have since been recognized as the founders of cognitive science. The term itself, however, was not coined until the 1970s, when the interdisciplinary field became more formally organized. During this period the Cognitive Science Society and the journal   were founded, and programs and departments of cognitive science were established at many universities. By the late 20th century, cognitive science had become a flourishing academic enterprise with hundreds of departments throughout the world and numerous international societies, journals, and conferences.

					 Insects are responsible for two major kinds of damage to growing crops. First is direct injury done to the   by the feeding insect, which eats leaves or burrows in stems,  , or roots. There are hundreds of     of this type, both in   and adults, among  , homopterans,  , coleopterans, lepidopterans, and dipterans. The second type is indirect damage in which the insect itself does little or no harm but transmits a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection into a crop. Examples include the viral diseases of sugar   and potatoes, carried from plant to plant by  . Although most insects grow and multiply in the crop they damage, certain grasshoppers are well-known exceptions. They can exist in a relatively harmless solitary phase for a number of years, during which time their numbers may increase. They then enter a   phase, forming gigantic migratory swarms, which are transported by winds or flight for hundreds or thousands of miles. These swarms may completely destroy crops in an invaded region. The   ( ) and   ( ) are two examples of this type of life cycle. Insect damage to humans and   also may be direct or indirect. Direct   injury by   is of relatively minor importance, although swarms of biting   and   often make life almost intolerable, as do   ( ) and salt-marsh mosquitoes.

An example of an insect that causes this condition is the   ( ) of the southern   and  . In many parts of the world, various blowflies infest the fleece and skin of  . This infestation, called  sheep-strike, causes severe economic damage. Many major human diseases are produced by microorganisms conveyed by insects, which serve as   of pathogens.   is caused by the protozoan  , which spends part of its developmental cycle in   mosquitoes.    , caused by  , is transmitted by the    .  , caused by the protozoan  , is carried by the sand fly  .   in humans and a group of cattle diseases that are widespread in Africa and known as   are caused by protozoan   transmitted by the bites of   ( ). Under nonsanitary conditions the common     can play an incidental role in the spread of human intestinal infections (e.g.,  , bacillary and amebic  ) by contamination of food. The   bacillus can be spread by deerfly bites, the bubonic   bacillus by fleas, and the epidemic   rickettsia by the louse  . Various mosquitoes spread viral diseases (e.g., several   diseases;   and   in humans and other animals). The relationships among the various organisms are complex. Malaria, for example, has a different   in almost every country in which it occurs, with different   species responsible for its spread. These same   affect the spread of sleeping sickness. Some relationships are indirect. Plague, a disease of   transmitted by   bites, is dangerous to humans only when heavy mortality among domestic   forces their infected fleas to attack people, thereby causing an outbreak of plague. Typhus, tularemia, encephalitis, and yellow fever also are maintained in   reservoirs and spread occasionally to humans. The historical objective of the entomologist was primarily to develop and introduce modifications into the   in such ways that diseases will not be spread by insects and crops will not be damaged by them. This objective has been achieved in numerous cases. For example, in many cities flies no longer play a major role in spreading intestinal infections, and land drainage, improved housing, and   use have eliminated malaria in many parts of the world. Massive outbreaks of the   in the 1860s led to the first large-scale use of   in agriculture. These highly poisonous chemicals (e.g., Paris green, lead arsenate, concentrated nicotine) were used in large quantities. The continued search for effective     led in the early 1940s to the production of  , a remarkable   that is highly toxic to most insects, nontoxic to humans in small quantities (although   effects may be severe), and long-lasting in effect. Widely used in agriculture for many years, DDT was not the perfect insecticide. It often killed parasites as effectively as the pests themselves, creating ecological imbalances that permitted new pests to develop large populations. Furthermore, resistant strains of pests appeared. The environmental longevity of many early insecticides was also found to cause significant ecological problems. Similar difficulties were encountered with many successors to DDT, such as Dieldrin and Endrin. In the course of developing effective insecticides, the primary emphases have been to reduce their potential to cause human health problems and their impact on the  .   methods of pest management have become increasingly important as the use of undesirable insecticides decreases. Biological methods include introducing pest strains that carry lethal  , flooding an area with sterile males (as was successfully done for the control of the screwworm fly), or developing new kinds of insecticide based on modifications of insects’ growth hormones. The   industry in Hawaii and the California citrus industry rely on biological control methods. Although these methods are not consistently effective, they are considered to be less harmful to the environment than are some chemicals.

					 The insect thorax consists of three segments (called the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax), which may be fused but are usually recognizable. Each segment has four groups of hard plates (sclerites); the groups are the notum (upper), the pleura (sides), and the sternum (underside). Thoracic sclerites are located on a given segment by using an appropriate prefix (pro-, meso-, meta-); for example, the notum (upper sclerite) of the prothorax is the pronotum. Each segment bears a pair of legs, and, in the mature insect, the mesothorax and metathorax typically carry a pair of wings. Each leg always consists of five parts: a coxa   to the thorax, a small trochanter, a femur, a tibia, and a tarsus with one to five segments. The tarsal segments often carry claws with adhesive pads between them (arolia or pulvilli); these enable the insect to hold onto smooth surfaces. The legs may be modified for leaping, burrowing, grasping  , or swimming in various ways. The wings at rest may be extended permanently on each side, as in some   (Odonata), or held erect above the body, as in mayflies (Ephemeroptera); in most insects, however, they are folded against the abdomen. The wing consists of cuticular sacs that bud out from the wall of the thorax; the sacs become flattened during development, and the two membranes, pressed together, are stiffened by thickenings of the   that form cylindrical veins carrying tracheae, nerves, and circulating   to all parts of the wing. Wings   for flight commonly are made of thin membranous cuticle. In some insects, notably beetles (Coleoptera), the wings of the middle segment of the thorax have become thick and horny and serve as protective sheaths (elytra) of the membranous hindwings. The locomotion of insects is effected by   acting on the external skeleton. In leaping insects (e.g., grasshoppers, fleas) the force of muscle contraction is used to compress a pad of an elastic  ,  ; when the catch mechanism is released, the   in the protein molecule is used to project the insect into the air. Insect flight is achieved by flapping the wings; during these movements the wing blade, twisted as it passes from elevation to depression, produces the same effect as the rotating propeller of an aircraft. Muscles capable of changing this   control the direction of flight. The chief flight muscles control flight in one of two ways: in dragonflies, directly on a lever at the base of each wing; but, in most insects, indirectly by deforming the shape of the thorax. The longitudinal muscles of the thorax depress the wings that are articulated with it; the vertical muscles elevate them. In butterflies, the number of wing beats per second may be as low as 8 to 12, while the rate in mosquitoes may exceed 600. These rates can exceed the frequency of contraction and relaxation of muscles responding to nerves because the muscles, after they have begun contracting and relaxing, respond to the   elastic tension in the thoracic wall, where the frequency is determined by the natural periodic oscillation of the thorax. The flight of insects, despite their small size, conforms to the   laws that regulate the flight of aircraft. The abdomen consists of a maximum of 11 segments, although this number commonly is reduced by  . Appendages are usually absent except in caterpillars, which use up to five pairs of abdominal prolegs in walking, and in   insects where the appendages at the hind end have become transformed into external genitalia. In the male these genitalia are paired claspers used to hold the female; in the female, three pairs of valvulae are used to   eggs during oviposition. In some insects, notably crickets and cockroaches, two feelers, or cerci, at the hind end of the abdomen bear sense organs. The  requirements of insects are much the same as those of  —water, inorganic ions, and essential   (i.e., those that cannot be synthesized by the animal). The requirements for preformed   and   vary with the  . Although   of the B group are needed by insects, neither vitamins A nor D are required, and many insects can synthesize ascorbic acid ( ). On the other hand, insects cannot synthesize adequate quantities of  ; thus, in effect, cholesterol can be defined as a vitamin for insects. Insects that feed solely on some restricted diet (e.g.,   blood,   juices, refined flour) have special cells called  mycetocytes that harbour   microorganisms; these organisms, transmitted through the   to the next generation, benefit their host by furnishing it with an internal source of vitamins and perhaps other essential nutrients. If the symbiotic microorganisms are removed experimentally, an insect fails to grow if not provided with a diet rich in vitamins. The digestive system consists of a   formed from the   region (stomodaeum), a   formed similarly from the anal region (proctodaeum), and a   (mesenteron). The foregut and hindgut are lined by cuticle   with that on the body surface. The mouth is followed by the muscular  , which functions in sucking and swallowing, and the  , which may be enlarged to form a  . The crop discharges into the midgut, sometimes, as in cockroaches, by way of a muscular gizzard or proventriculus. The termination of the midgut is marked by the attachment of the  , the chief organs of  . The hindgut commonly consists of a narrow ileum followed by a larger and often thick-walled  , which discharges at the  . Digestive  , secreted not only by the   but also by the cells of the midgut and its  , vary with the diet of the insect. The most important     by the salivary glands is  ; the midgut secretes several enzymes including protease,  , amylase, and invertase. The products of   are absorbed chiefly in the midgut. The hindgut receives food residues from the midgut as well as waste products from the malpighian tubules. The end products of   metabolism are  , small amounts of amino acids, and  ; in aquatic insects, ammonium salts may be a major form for nitrogen excretion. In the rectum, the epithelial cells lining the gut wall often are enlarged, particularly in restricted areas where they form rectal glands. The epithelial cells of these glands are supplied richly with tracheae and function in the reabsorption of water and  . The rectal contents of insects that inhabit dry   commonly are reduced to dry fecal pellets prior to discharge. In many insects, particularly those which feed on relatively dry foods (e.g., beetles infesting stored grain), the upper segments of the malpighian tubules are bound by a sheath to the rectal surface and form a cryptonephridial system that serves to increase the capacity of the rectum for reabsorbing water and salts. The products of digestion, discharged into the hemocoele, or general body cavity, are transported by the circulatory fluid, or  , to the organs.

					 For primitive peoples who gathered  , insects were a significant food source.   plagues,   swarms, large palm   grubs, and other insects are still sources of   in some countries. The dry scaly excreta of   ( ) on   or   trees is the source of   in the  . Coccids were once the source of the crimson    . The  , or  , from   scale insects found on Mexican  , was used for dying cloth by the   and is used today as a dye in foods,  ,  , and  . Several insect   are used commercially, especially   and    . The resinous product of the lac insect   (Homoptera), which is   for this purpose, is the source of commercial  . Two of the most important domesticated insects are the   (Lepidoptera) and the   (Hymenoptera). Some coarse silks are produced from the   of large wild silkworm  . Most commercial silks, however, come from the silkworm  . This insect is unknown in the wild state and exists only in  . It was domesticated in   thousands of years ago, and  , notably in China and Japan, has produced many specialized strains. The honeybee is a close relative of existing wild  . In the  ,   was Europe’s most important  , and both beeswax and honey are still articles of commerce. However, the major importance of honeybees lies in their   of   trees and other crops. When insects that break down dead trees invade structural timbers in buildings, they become  . This is true of insects such as   and various   that ecologically are latecomers to   and are capable of breaking down the   in hair and feathers. When these insects invade skins, furs, and wool garments or carpets, they can become problems for humans. In many hot, dry climates, as in   or the plains of India, ripened   in the fields is invaded by certain beetles and moths. When the grain is harvested, these insects thrive in the grain stores. They can be carried throughout the world in commerce and have become universal pests of stored grain, dried fruit,  , and other products.   and disinfestation methods are used to control importation of such insects from grain-exporting countries. Many insects are   feeders, and, when the plants are of agricultural importance, humans are often forced to compete with these insects. Populations of insects are limited by such factors as unfavourable  , predators and  , and viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases, as well as many other factors that operate to make insect populations stable.   that encourage the planting of ever larger areas to single crops, which provides virtually unlimited food resources, has removed some of these regulating factors and allowed the rate of   of insects that attack those crops to increase. This increases the probability of great infestations of certain insect pests. Many natural forests, which form similar giant monocultures, always seem to have been subject to periodic outbreaks of destructive insects. In some agricultural monocultures, nonnative insect pests have been accidentally introduced along with a crop but without also bringing along its full range of natural enemies. This has occurred in the   with the   ( ) of apple and other fruit trees, the   ( ) of citrus, the   ( ; also called  ), and others. The   ( ), which caused appalling destruction to the     in the United States beginning about 1840, was a native insect of semidesert country. The beetle, which fed on the buffalo burr plant, adapted itself to a newly introduced and abundant diet of potatoes and thus escaped from all previous controlling factors. Similar situations often have been controlled by determining the major predators or parasites of an alien insect   in its country of origin and introducing them as control agents. A classic example is the cottony-cushion scale, which threatened the California citrus industry in 1886. A predatory  , the   ( ), was introduced from  , and within a year or two the   had virtually disappeared. The success was repeated in every country where the scale insect had become established without its predators. In eastern Canada in the early 1940s the European  spruce sawfly ( ), which had caused   damage, was completely controlled by the spontaneous appearance of a   disease, perhaps unknowingly introduced from Europe. This event led to increased interest in using insect diseases as potential means of managing pest populations.

					 Both in complexity of behaviour and learning capacity,   wasps and bees are the equals of social wasps or honeybees. Social insects, however, have developed a   in which the members must do the work required at the proper time. If the society is to succeed, its needs must be communicated to the individual members, and those individuals must act accordingly. These needs may be met by a temporary change in the behaviour of existing individuals, or they may result in developmental changes that vary the number of individuals in the various castes (e.g., new queens, males, workers, or soldiers). Commonly, both behavioral and developmental changes are initiated by  , chemical messengers that   information from one member of a colony to another. Insect societies are gigantic families, with all individuals being the offspring of a single female. In the   the single   in the hive secretes a   known as the   (oxodecenoic acid), which is taken up by the workers and passed throughout the colony by food sharing. So long as the queen substance is present, all members are informed that the queen is healthy. If the workers are deprived of queen substance, they proceed at once to build queen cells and feed the young   with a special   known as   that results in the production of new queens. All termites and ants and some   of wasps and bees are the only insect groups containing truly social species. However, there are many other species that exhibit some lesser degree of interaction among individuals. Insects feed on every sort of organic matter, and their methods of feeding and   have become modified accordingly. The major climatic   faced by terrestrial insects are   extremes and desiccation. Different species function best at various optimal temperatures. If conditions are too hot, an insect seeks out a cool, moist, and shady spot. If exposed to the sun on a hot day, an insect will position itself so as to present the smallest amount of body surface to the heat. If conditions are too cool, insects will remain in the sun to warm themselves. Many butterflies must spread their wings and expose the large surface to the sun like solar collectors to warm the flight muscles before they can  . Many moths can raise their temperature by vibrating their wings or “shivering” before taking flight. The heat generated in this way is conserved by   or scales that maintain an insulating layer of air around the body. The optimum muscle temperature for flight is from 38 to 40 °C (100 to 104 °F). In extremely cold weather the danger for insects is freezing, and insects that survive winters in cold latitudes are called cold hardy. A few insects (e.g., some caterpillars and aquatic   larvae) tolerate   in body fluids, although it is probable that the cell contents do not freeze. In most insects, however, cold hardiness means resistance to freezing. This resistance results partly from accumulation of large quantities of   as an antifreeze and partly from physical changes in the   that permit supercooling to temperatures far below the   of water without the blood freezing. Preventing water loss is another important aspect of life in terrestrial  . All insects have a waxy ( ) layer that coats the outer surface of the   to prevent water loss from the body wall. In addition, most terrestrial insects also have   to avoid water loss through respiration and waste  . Major changes required for life in an aquatic habitat include modifications of the legs for swimming and adaptations for respiration. Most aquatic insects swim using the second or third (or both) pairs of legs. In some, the distal (away from the body) leg segments may simply be flattened and serve as oars. In others, there is a row of movable hairs on these segments that fold against the leg to offer less resistance during the forward stroke and then extend out, forming an oarlike surface during the power stroke. In some, like the water striders (Gerridae), long thin legs allow them to “walk” on the surface film of ponds and streams. To breathe, some insects simply rise to the water surface and take atmospheric air into their tracheal systems. Mosquito larvae use only the last pair of abdominal spiracles, which open at the tip of a respiratory  .   (e.g.,  ) have converted the space between the protective sheaths on the hind wings (elytra) and the   into an air-storage chamber. Air-breathing insects can prolong the period of submergence by trapping air among their surface hairs. This air film acts as a physical   and makes possible oxygen uptake from water. Other adaptations to an aquatic   have occurred in larvae that obtain all their   directly from the water. In midge larvae, abundant   (breathing tubes) contact the entire thin cuticle.   (Trichoptera) and   (Ephemeroptera) larvae have tracheal gills on the abdomen or  . In   larvae, the gills are inside the rectum, and the water is pumped in and out through the  , whereas   have external rectal gills. Insects may   some protection from the horny or leathery cuticle but may also have various chemical defenses. Some caterpillars have special irritating hairs, which break up into barbed fragments that contain a   substance that causes intense itching and serves as a protection against many  . Dermal glands of many insects discharge repellent or poisonous secretions over the cuticle, whereas others are protected by poisons that are present continuously in the blood and tissues. Such poisons often are derived from the plants on which the insects feed. In many hymenopterans (ants, bees, wasps) accessory glands in the female reproductive system have become modified to produce toxic proteins. These poisons, injected into the   of the  , paralyze it. In this state the prey serves as food for the   larva. Stings are also used by hymenopterans, including ants, wasps, and bees, for self-defense. Concealment is an important protective device for insects. For some, this may be accomplished by simply hiding beneath stones or the bark of  . However, many species rely on some forms of protective  . Protective coloration may take the form of   (cryptic coloration) in which the insect blends into its background. The coloration of many insects copies a specific background with extraordinary detail. Stick insects ( ) can change their colour to match that of the background by moving pigment granules in their epidermal cells. Some caterpillars also have patterns that develop in response to a background, although these are irreversible. Insects such as caterpillars, which rely on cryptic coloration, often combine it with a rigid deathlike position. Alternatively, insects that have well-developed chemical defenses generally show   warning (aposematic) coloration. Experiments have proved that predators such as birds quickly learn to associate such coloration “labels” with nauseous or dangerous prey. Finally, insects without nauseous qualities may gain protection by  —developing a conspicuous colour pattern similar to that found in distasteful species. The factors that limit the numbers of insect species are complex. Experimental studies of a population of grain beetles in a container of   show that the complexities increase if a second species is added. With insects in natural habitats,   not only with members of their own species but with numerous other species as well, the obstacles to survival become increasingly great. Competition among species is reduced to some extent by specialization of species to  , or habitats, for which other insects do not compete. Formerly, controversy arose over whether numbers were always density dependent (i.e., limited by the density of the species itself) or whether catastrophic actions, notably the vagaries of weather, were of prime importance. It has since become generally thought that the ultimate factor in the control of numbers is competition within the species for food and other needs. However, in many circumstances, before competition for food becomes significant, numbers are reduced by external factors. Competition within a species is often reduced by wholesale   to new localities. Migration may occur by active flight or, as in aphids and locusts, largely directed by the wind. Another important factor in the regulation of populations is balanced   of species, in which the prevalence of individuals with given characteristics changes according to the action of   as the state of the   changes. The insect is covered by the cuticle, a layer of inert material laid down by a single sheet of epidermal cells. It consists mainly of  , a carbohydrate also known as polyacetylglucosamine, and  , a hard substance composed of   tanned by  . The cuticle, which has an outer layer of waterproofing   to prevent loss of water by  , also serves as the   to which the   are attached. In insects such as caterpillars, in which the cuticle is soft and flexible, the skeleton is of the hydrostatic type. In this type, body fluid pressure, maintained by muscle   beneath the body wall, provides the firmness necessary for the function of muscles involved in movement. In insects with hard bodies, the cuticle is made up of hardened areas called   that are connected by flexible joints. At the back of the head and in the thorax, hardened ingrowths of the cuticle, known as apodemes, furnish a kind of internal skeleton for muscular attachment. Insect colours depend partly on   incorporated in the cuticle. However, the most important pigments often occur in epidermal cells below the cuticle. In butterflies and moths, pigments may be deposited in flattened hairs, or scales, covering the wings. Some of the most brilliant insect colours are not the result of pigmentation but are physical interference colours produced by fine laminae (grooves or pits) in the surface of the wing scales or the cuticle itself. The ancestors of insects most likely had bodies consisting of many similar segments with only minor aggregation of the nervous system in the   (head) segment. These primitive insect ancestors probably looked something like modern  , with a pair of appendages on each body segment but without a well-developed head. In present-day insects the primitive segments are grouped into three regions known as the head, thorax, and abdomen. The first six primitive segments have fused to form the head, and the appendages of these segments have become modified into antennae that bear numerous sense organs and   that convey food to the mouth. Eyes also are prominent on the head. In most insects the mouthparts, adapted for  , consist of several parts; behind the upper lip or labrum is a pair of hard, toothed  . These are followed by a pair of structures called first  , each consisting of a bladelike lacinia, a hoodlike galea, and a segmented palp   sense organ. The paired second maxillae are partly fused in the midline to form the lower lip, or  . Sometimes a median tonguelike structure, called the  , arises from the floor of the mouth. Insect mouthparts have been modified strikingly and reflect particular methods of feeding. The dipterans (true flies) provide instructive examples. In the primitive bloodsucking flies (e.g., the    ) the mandibles and maxillae form serrated blades that cut through the skin and   of the host  . The  epipharynx and hypopharynx are elongated and grooved so that, when apposed, they form a tube for sucking blood. The tonguelike labium is used for   exposed fluids. Dipteran mouthparts have evolved in two directions. In the   (Culicidae) the mandibles, maxillae, epipharynx, and hypopharynx have become exceedingly slender stylets that form a fine bundle and are used for piercing skin and entering blood vessels. The labium, elongated and deeply grooved, serves only as a sheath for the stylet bundle. In the    , however, mandibles and maxillae have been lost; the tonguelike labium alone remains and serves for feeding on exposed surfaces. Certain flies related to   have reacquired a capacity to suck blood; however, since they have lost both mandibles and maxillae, a new bloodsucking mechanism has developed. Labial teeth have evolved for cutting through the skin, and the labium itself is plunged into the tissues. The     has an arrangement of this kind. In the    , the labium has become a fine, needlelike structure normally protected by a sheath formed from the palps of the lost maxillae. Other mouthpart modifications of the mouthpart components provide the cutting and sucking mouthparts of fleas (Siphonaptera), plant-sucking insects (Homoptera), bloodsucking bugs (Heteroptera), honeybees (Hymenoptera), and nectar-feeding butterflies (Lepidoptera).

(born May 8, 1919,  ,  , U.S.—died February 11, 1989, New York City) American  , best known for his theory of  , according to which inconsistency between  , or between thoughts and actions, leads to discomfort (dissonance), which motivates changes in thoughts or behaviours. Festinger also made important contributions to the study of  , self-evaluation, and attitude change. Festinger graduated with a B.A. in   from the City College of New York in 1939. He then entered the  , where he studied with the German-born social psychologist   and obtained a Ph.D. in 1942. One year later he moved to the   to work as a statistician for the National Research Council’s Committee on the Selection and Training of Aircraft Pilots. He stayed there until the end of  . In 1945 Festinger became assistant professor at the Research Center for Group  , which was then headed by Lewin, at the   (MIT). The centre was committed to the application of psychological concepts and methods to solve social problems, and it attracted many talented students, including   and Harold Kelley. An important early research project was based on attitude surveys of residents in married student housing. The study documented a textbook phenomenon: friendships were more likely to occur the closer the people were physically (even by just a few yards). Similarity in attitudes was also critical: attitudes of residents tended to converge, but residents who held   attitudes were likely to be social isolates. One central idea for Festinger at this time was that group members acquired similar beliefs and opinions because of social pressures toward uniformity or fitting in. In his informal  , he proposed that people are susceptible to social pressures when they are attracted to a group. Such attraction occurs because some goals can be pursued successfully only with the cooperation of others or because groups provide validation about social reality, which is necessary because some opinions and beliefs cannot be tested directly or objectively (e.g., “Should abortion be legal?”; “Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?”). Assuming that people are attracted to a particular group, they could   for group uniformity or agreement by trying to change other people’s opinions (communication), by modifying their own views to match those of other group members (opinion change), or by rejecting divergent others as appropriate references (rejection). Such pressures should be greater in attractive groups and increase as an issue becomes more relevant to a group’s goals. To test the theory, Festinger and his students conducted a series of laboratory experiments. Groups (or clubs) were formed of previously unacquainted individuals who were asked to discuss various issues. Factors such as types of goals, need for social reality, attractiveness, issue relevance, and so on were manipulated. In some experiments, accomplices posed as subjects and played scripted roles as group members with deviating or   opinions. Although precedents for this ambitious research program existed in earlier work by Lewin and the Turkish-born social psychologist Muzafer Sherif, Festinger magnified the experimenter’s role as playwright and stage director. For his dissertation, Schachter, under Festinger’s direction, placed accomplices in groups. One adopted the majority view (i.e., the “mode”) from the beginning, another initially voiced a deviant view but over the course of the discussion adopted the consensual position (i.e., the “slider”), and a third (the “deviate”) maintained the opposing view. Observers coded group discussion behaviours. The actual subjects tried to persuade the other discussion partners. The mode was readily accepted, as was the slider after adopting the majority view. Initially, much communication was directed at the deviate, but communication declined when the deviate proved impossible to convince, and the deviate was nominated for the most undesirable club assignments. Consistent with the theory, group goals or social reality were achieved by striving for group  , the pressures to obtain uniformity were   via different behavioral routes, and deviates were rejected. This experiment reflects several features of Festinger’s research. Festinger realized that progress in any   required methods appropriate to that field. Accordingly,   needed its own experimental approach. Following Lewin’s lead, he conceived of the new   as a kind of experimental theatre, with cover stories, accomplices, and deception to control for confounding factors and to create a situation that was perceived as psychologically meaningful to the subject. After Lewin’s death in 1947, the Research Center for Group Dynamics, with most of its remaining faculty, moved to the  . In 1951 Festinger moved to a tenure-track position at the  , where Schachter was already on the faculty. At the University of Minnesota, Festinger developed social comparison theory, his second major contribution to social psychology. Informal social communication theory was about the power of the group over the person. In contrast, social comparison theory emphasized how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities against those of others. Social comparison theory posited that people evaluate their abilities and opinions by comparing them with those of others when it is not   to test them directly. Comparison leads to pressures toward uniformity (i.e., similarity), but the tendency to compare will cease if others are too different in dimensions that are related to the ability or opinion at issue. For opinions, agreement with others who presumably are also motivated to hold correct views tends to make people feel more confident. For abilities, observing those with similar abilities allows people to learn what actions they are capable of. Social comparison theory also recognizes a distinctive feature of abilities. People want to be slightly better than everyone else because the desire to be better or to improve is emphasized in Western  . This means that, in Western cultures, complete opinion agreement may be satisfactory to everyone, but completely equal abilities will not be—implying that “a state of social quiescence is never reached,” as Festinger put it.

A common goal in defining any   concept is a statement that corresponds to common usage. Acceptance of that aim, however, entails some peril. It implicitly assumes that common language categorizes in scientifically meaningful ways; that the word  , for example, corresponds to a definite psychological process. However, there appears to be good reason to doubt the validity of this assumption. The phenomena of learning are so varied and   that their inclusion in a single category may not be warranted. Recognizing this danger (and the   that no definition of learning is likely to be totally satisfactory) a definition proposed in 1961 by G.A.  Kimble may be considered representative: Learning is a relatively permanent change in a behavioral   that occurs as a result of reinforced practice. Although the definition is useful, it still leaves problems. The definition may be helpful by indicating that the change need not be an improvement; addictions and   are learned as well as high-level skills and useful knowledge. The phrase relatively permanent serves to exclude temporary behavioral changes that may depend on such factors as fatigue, the effects of drugs, or alterations in motives. The word potentiality covers effects that do not appear at once; one might learn about tourniquets by reading a first-aid manual and put the information to use later. To say that learning occurs as a result of practice excludes the effects of physiological development, aging, and brain damage. The stipulation that practice must be   serves to distinguish learning from the opposed loss of unreinforced habits. Reinforcement objectively refers to any condition—often reward or punishment—that may promote learning. However, the definition raises difficulties. How permanent is relatively permanent? Suppose one looks up an address, writes it on an envelope, but five minutes later has to look it up again to be sure it is correct. Does this qualify as relatively permanent? While commonly accepted as learning, it seems to violate the definition. What exactly is the result that occurs with practice? Is it a change in the  ? Is it a matter of providing stimuli that can evoke responses they previously would not? Does it mean developing associations, gaining insights, or gaining new perspective? Such questions serve to distinguish Kimble’s descriptive definition from theoretical attempts to define learning by identifying the nature of its underlying process. These may be neurophysiological, perceptual, or associationistic; they begin to   theoretical issues and to identify the bases for and   of learning. (The processes of perceptual learning are treated in the article  .) Even the simplest animals display such primitive forms of adaptive activity as  , the elimination of practiced responses. For example, a paramecium can learn to escape from a narrow glass tube to get to food. Learning in this case consists of the elimination (habituation) of unnecessary movements. Habituation also has been demonstrated for mammals in which control normally exercised by higher (brain) centres has been impaired by severing the  . For example, repeated application of   to the paw of a cat so treated leads to habituation of the reflex   reaction. Whether single-celled animals or cats that function only through the spinal cord are capable of higher forms of learning is a matter of controversy. Sporadic reports that conditioned responses may be possible among such animals have been sharply debated. At higher evolutionary levels the range of phenomena called learning is more extensive. Many mammalian species display the following varieties of learning. This is the form of learning studied by   (1849–1936). Some neutral  , such as a bell, is presented just before delivery of some effective stimulus (say, food or acid placed in the mouth of a dog). A response such as salivation, originally   only by the effective stimulus, eventually appears when the initially neutral stimulus is presented. The response is said to have become conditioned. Classical conditioning seems easiest to establish for involuntary reactions mediated by the  . This indicates learning to obtain reward or to avoid punishment. Laboratory examples of such conditioning among small mammals or birds are common. Rats or pigeons may be taught to press levers for food; they also learn to avoid or terminate electric shock. In the form of learning called chaining the subject is required to make a series of responses in a definite order. For example, a sequence of correct turns in a maze is to be mastered, or a list of words is to be learned in specific sequence. Within limits, laboratory animals can be taught to regulate the force with which they press a lever or to control the speed at which they run down an alley. Such skills are learned when a reward is made   on quantitatively constrained performance. Among human learners complex, precise skills (  tying shoelaces) are routine. In   learning the subject is reinforced to respond only to selected sensory characteristics of stimuli.   that can be established in this way may be quite subtle. Pigeons, for example, can learn to discriminate differences in colours that are indistinguishable to human beings without the use of special devices. An organism is said to have learned a concept when it responds uniquely to all objects or events in a given logical class as distinct from other classes. Even geese can master such concepts as roundness and triangularity; after training, they can respond appropriately to round or triangular figures they have never seen before.

					 Most insects begin their lives as fertilized eggs. The  , or  , is commonly pierced by respiratory openings that lead to an air-filled meshwork inside the shell. For some insects (e.g.,   and  ) a batch of eggs is cemented together to form an   or ootheca. Insects may pass unfavourable seasons in the egg stage. Eggs of the     (Collembola) and of some grasshoppers (Orthoptera) pass summer   in a dry shrivelled state and resume development when moistened. Most eggs, however, retain their water although they may pass the winter in a state of arrested development, or  , usually at some early stage in embryonic development. However, dried eggs of   mosquitoes enter a state of dormancy after development is complete and quickly hatch when placed in water. The hatching of young   is achieved in several ways. Some, such as  , bite their way out of the egg. Many, such as the  , have   spines with which they cut a slit in the shell. Some insect eggs have a preformed “escape cap” that the larva pops from the shell by increasing the pressure inside the egg. Depending on the  , this may be accomplished either by swallowing air and then constricting   in the body to   pressure on the cap or by having an expandable region on the   (many   have a ptilinum) that can be extended by hydraulic (blood) pressure. After hatching, the larva continues to distend itself in this way, although the ptilinum collapses back into the body, until the   hardens. Once formed, the insect cuticle cannot grow. Growth can occur only by a series of molts ( ) during which new and larger cuticles form and old cuticles are shed. Molting makes possible large changes in body form. In the most primitive wingless insects ( ) such as the    , there is almost no change in form throughout growth to the  . These are known as   insects. Among insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), true bugs (Heteroptera), and homopterans (e.g.,  , scale insects), the general form is constant until the final  , when the larva undergoes substantial changes in body form to become a winged adult with fully developed genitalia. These insects, called hemimetabolous, are said to undergo  . The higher orders of insects, including   (butterflies and moths),   (beetles),   (ants, wasps, and bees), Diptera (true flies), and several others, are called   because larvae are totally unlike adults. These larvae undergo a series of molts with little change in form before they enter into complete  , which includes molting first into   and then into fully winged adults. Larvae, which vary considerably in shape, are classified in five forms:  eruciform (caterpillar-like),  scarabaeiform (grublike),  campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active),  elateriform (wireworm-like), and   (maggot-like). The three types of pupae are:  , with appendages more or less glued to the body;  , with the appendages free and not glued to the body; and  coarctate, which is essentially exarate but remaining covered by the cast skins (exuviae) of the next to the last larval instar (name given to the form of an insect between molts).

					 Scientists familiar with insects realize the difficulty in attempting to estimate individual numbers of insects beyond areas of a few acres or a few square miles in extent. Figures soon become so large as to be incomprehensible. The large populations and great variety of insects are related to their small size, high rates of reproduction, and   of suitable food supplies. Insects abound in the tropics, both in numbers of different kinds and in numbers of individuals. If the insects (including the young and adults of all forms) are counted on a square yard (0.84 square metre) of rich moist surface soil, 500 are found easily and 2,000 are not unusual in soil samples in the north temperate zone. This amounts to roughly 4 million insects on one moist acre (0.41 hectare). In such an area only an occasional  ,  , or large  , supergiants among insects, probably would be noticed. Only a few thousand  , those that attack people’s crops, herds, and products and those that carry disease, interfere with   life seriously enough to require control measures. Insects are adapted to every land and freshwater habitat where food is available, from   to  , from glacial fields and cold mountain streams to  , lowland ponds and  . Many live in brackish water up to   the salinity of seawater, a few live on the surface of seawater, and some     can live in pools of crude  , where they eat other insects that fall in. Insects play many important roles in nature. They aid  ,  , and other organisms in the decomposition of organic matter and in soil formation. The decay of carrion, for example, brought about mainly by bacteria, is accelerated by the   of   and  . The activities of these larvae, which distribute and consume bacteria, are followed by those of moths and beetles, which break down hair and feathers. Insects and   have evolved together. Many plants depend on insects for  . Some insects are predators of others. Certain insects provide sources of commercially important products such as  ,  ,  ,  , or  , all of which can be of direct benefit to humans. Because they feed on many types of organic matter, insects can cause considerable agricultural damage. Insect pests devour crops of food or timber, either in the field or in storage, and convey infective microorganisms to crops, farm animals, and humans.

					 Insects are responsible for two major kinds of damage to growing crops. First is direct injury done to the   by the feeding insect, which eats leaves or burrows in stems,  , or roots. There are hundreds of     of this type, both in   and adults, among  , homopterans,  , coleopterans, lepidopterans, and dipterans. The second type is indirect damage in which the insect itself does little or no harm but transmits a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection into a crop. Examples include the viral diseases of sugar   and potatoes, carried from plant to plant by  . Although most insects grow and multiply in the crop they damage, certain grasshoppers are well-known exceptions. They can exist in a relatively harmless solitary phase for a number of years, during which time their numbers may increase. They then enter a   phase, forming gigantic migratory swarms, which are transported by winds or flight for hundreds or thousands of miles. These swarms may completely destroy crops in an invaded region. The   ( ) and   ( ) are two examples of this type of life cycle. Insect damage to humans and   also may be direct or indirect. Direct   injury by   is of relatively minor importance, although swarms of biting   and   often make life almost intolerable, as do   ( ) and salt-marsh mosquitoes. Persistent irritation by biting flies can cause deterioration in the health of  . Some  , in addition to depositing their eggs in carcasses, also invade the tissue of living   including humans, a condition known as  . An example of an insect that causes this condition is the   ( ) of the southern   and  . In many parts of the world, various blowflies infest the fleece and skin of  . This infestation, called  sheep-strike, causes severe economic damage. Many major human diseases are produced by microorganisms conveyed by insects, which serve as   of pathogens.   is caused by the protozoan  , which spends part of its developmental cycle in   mosquitoes.    , caused by  , is transmitted by the    .  , caused by the protozoan  , is carried by the sand fly  .   in humans and a group of cattle diseases that are widespread in Africa and known as   are caused by protozoan   transmitted by the bites of   ( ). Under nonsanitary conditions the common     can play an incidental role in the spread of human intestinal infections (e.g.,  , bacillary and amebic  ) by contamination of food. The   bacillus can be spread by deerfly bites, the bubonic   bacillus by fleas, and the epidemic   rickettsia by the louse  . Various mosquitoes spread viral diseases (e.g., several   diseases;   and   in humans and other animals). The relationships among the various organisms are complex. Malaria, for example, has a different   in almost every country in which it occurs, with different   species responsible for its spread. These same   affect the spread of sleeping sickness. Some relationships are indirect. Plague, a disease of   transmitted by   bites, is dangerous to humans only when heavy mortality among domestic   forces their infected fleas to attack people, thereby causing an outbreak of plague. Typhus, tularemia, encephalitis, and yellow fever also are maintained in   reservoirs and spread occasionally to humans. The historical objective of the entomologist was primarily to develop and introduce modifications into the   in such ways that diseases will not be spread by insects and crops will not be damaged by them. This objective has been achieved in numerous cases. For example, in many cities flies no longer play a major role in spreading intestinal infections, and land drainage, improved housing, and   use have eliminated malaria in many parts of the world. Massive outbreaks of the   in the 1860s led to the first large-scale use of   in agriculture. These highly poisonous chemicals (e.g., Paris green, lead arsenate, concentrated nicotine) were used in large quantities. The continued search for effective     led in the early 1940s to the production of  , a remarkable   that is highly toxic to most insects, nontoxic to humans in small quantities (although   effects may be severe), and long-lasting in effect. Widely used in agriculture for many years, DDT was not the perfect insecticide. It often killed parasites as effectively as the pests themselves, creating ecological imbalances that permitted new pests to develop large populations. Furthermore, resistant strains of pests appeared. The environmental longevity of many early insecticides was also found to cause significant ecological problems. Similar difficulties were encountered with many successors to DDT, such as Dieldrin and Endrin. In the course of developing effective insecticides, the primary emphases have been to reduce their potential to cause human health problems and their impact on the  .   methods of pest management have become increasingly important as the use of undesirable insecticides decreases. Biological methods include introducing pest strains that carry lethal  , flooding an area with sterile males (as was successfully done for the control of the screwworm fly), or developing new kinds of insecticide based on modifications of insects’ growth hormones. The   industry in Hawaii and the California citrus industry rely on biological control methods. Although these methods are not consistently effective, they are considered to be less harmful to the environment than are some chemicals.

(born May 8, 1919,  ,  , U.S.—died February 11, 1989, New York City) American  , best known for his theory of  , according to which inconsistency between  , or between thoughts and actions, leads to discomfort (dissonance), which motivates changes in thoughts or behaviours. Festinger also made important contributions to the study of  , self-evaluation, and attitude change. Festinger graduated with a B.A. in   from the City College of New York in 1939. He then entered the  , where he studied with the German-born social psychologist   and obtained a Ph.D. in 1942. One year later he moved to the   to work as a statistician for the National Research Council’s Committee on the Selection and Training of Aircraft Pilots. He stayed there until the end of  . In 1945 Festinger became assistant professor at the Research Center for Group  , which was then headed by Lewin, at the   (MIT). The centre was committed to the application of psychological concepts and methods to solve social problems, and it attracted many talented students, including   and Harold Kelley. An important early research project was based on attitude surveys of residents in married student housing. The study documented a textbook phenomenon: friendships were more likely to occur the closer the people were physically (even by just a few yards). Similarity in attitudes was also critical: attitudes of residents tended to converge, but residents who held   attitudes were likely to be social isolates. One central idea for Festinger at this time was that group members acquired similar beliefs and opinions because of social pressures toward uniformity or fitting in. In his informal  , he proposed that people are susceptible to social pressures when they are attracted to a group. Such attraction occurs because some goals can be pursued successfully only with the cooperation of others or because groups provide validation about social reality, which is necessary because some opinions and beliefs cannot be tested directly or objectively (e.g., “Should abortion be legal?”; “Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?”). Assuming that people are attracted to a particular group, they could   for group uniformity or agreement by trying to change other people’s opinions (communication), by modifying their own views to match those of other group members (opinion change), or by rejecting divergent others as appropriate references (rejection). Such pressures should be greater in attractive groups and increase as an issue becomes more relevant to a group’s goals. To test the theory, Festinger and his students conducted a series of laboratory experiments. Groups (or clubs) were formed of previously unacquainted individuals who were asked to discuss various issues. Factors such as types of goals, need for social reality, attractiveness, issue relevance, and so on were manipulated. In some experiments, accomplices posed as subjects and played scripted roles as group members with deviating or   opinions. Although precedents for this ambitious research program existed in earlier work by Lewin and the Turkish-born social psychologist Muzafer Sherif, Festinger magnified the experimenter’s role as playwright and stage director. For his dissertation, Schachter, under Festinger’s direction, placed accomplices in groups. One adopted the majority view (i.e., the “mode”) from the beginning, another initially voiced a deviant view but over the course of the discussion adopted the consensual position (i.e., the “slider”), and a third (the “deviate”) maintained the opposing view. Observers coded group discussion behaviours. The actual subjects tried to persuade the other discussion partners. The mode was readily accepted, as was the slider after adopting the majority view. Initially, much communication was directed at the deviate, but communication declined when the deviate proved impossible to convince, and the deviate was nominated for the most undesirable club assignments. Consistent with the theory, group goals or social reality were achieved by striving for group  , the pressures to obtain uniformity were   via different behavioral routes, and deviates were rejected. This experiment reflects several features of Festinger’s research. Festinger realized that progress in any   required methods appropriate to that field. Accordingly,   needed its own experimental approach. Following Lewin’s lead, he conceived of the new   as a kind of experimental theatre, with cover stories, accomplices, and deception to control for confounding factors and to create a situation that was perceived as psychologically meaningful to the subject. After Lewin’s death in 1947, the Research Center for Group Dynamics, with most of its remaining faculty, moved to the  . In 1951 Festinger moved to a tenure-track position at the  , where Schachter was already on the faculty. At the University of Minnesota, Festinger developed social comparison theory, his second major contribution to social psychology. Informal social communication theory was about the power of the group over the person. In contrast, social comparison theory emphasized how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities against those of others. Social comparison theory posited that people evaluate their abilities and opinions by comparing them with those of others when it is not   to test them directly. Comparison leads to pressures toward uniformity (i.e., similarity), but the tendency to compare will cease if others are too different in dimensions that are related to the ability or opinion at issue. For opinions, agreement with others who presumably are also motivated to hold correct views tends to make people feel more confident. For abilities, observing those with similar abilities allows people to learn what actions they are capable of. Social comparison theory also recognizes a distinctive feature of abilities. People want to be slightly better than everyone else because the desire to be better or to improve is emphasized in Western  . This means that, in Western cultures, complete opinion agreement may be satisfactory to everyone, but completely equal abilities will not be—implying that “a state of social quiescence is never reached,” as Festinger put it.

In fact,   was the very name of  ’s 2014 documentary about our two contests. I defeated Deep Blue (4–2) in our first face-off in 1996. When the computer defeated me in the first of our six games, it marked the first time a machine had won a game against a world champion under classical tournament conditions. When the computer beat me in the decisive sixth game of our 1997 rematch, its 3.5–2.5 victory (winning two games, with three draws) marked the first time a computer had ever won a classical   against a world champion. When I lost the rematch, it was hailed by many as a momentous occasion for human progress on par with the Moon landing. I didn’t feel so enthusiastic about it myself, but I realized that while the era of intelligent machines was ending in  , it was only getting started in every other aspect of our lives. Real life—language, business, education, health—doesn’t have a tidy framework like chess. Artificial intelligence (AI) today begins with a huge amount of data and clever algorithms to analyze it, without strict pre-existing rules. Machine learning is pushing the frontier of what machines can do better than humans—medical diagnosis, legal research—and how it does it has limitless potential. This type of AI doesn’t care   something works,   it works. These machines even teach themselves better ways to learn, effectively coding themselves iteratively. Chess, still an AI bellwether, demonstrated this principle in astonishing fashion in late 2017, when the machine-learning algorithm   taught itself to play better than any existing program or human after four hours of playing against itself. Think about all the new ways of solving problems based on objective results instead of centuries of accumulated human dogma. This is a brave new world, one in which machines are doing things humans do not know how to teach them to do, one in which machines figure out the rules—and, if we are lucky, explain them to us. If this sounds threatening instead of amazing, you’ve been watching too many dystopian Hollywood movies. Humans will still set the goals and establish the priorities. We must ensure that our agnostic machines represent the best of our human morality. If we succeed, our new tools will make us smarter, enabling us to better understand our world and ourselves. Our real challenge is to avoid complacency, to keep thinking up new directions for AI to explore. And that’s one job that can never be done by a machine. One very real area of concern, however, is the political polarization of the world. Since I retired from professional chess, much of my life has been divided between   activism and investigations into human and machine  , and we are at a critical inflection point in both areas. The global rise of   threatens to roll back a half-century of democratic proliferation that was capped by the fall of the   in 1989 and the collapse of the   two years later. Today, freedom is under assault from all sides—geographically from the Americas to Europe to Asia, politically from both right and left, in regimes that have relatively little experience with democracy and in several of the world’s freest states. The political center is being hollowed out, with extremist positions leading to backlash and whiplash. Over half the world’s population lives under nondemocratic regimes today. Even more troubling, that percentage has been rising. Autocratic regimes like my native Russia have become full-blown dictatorships. A tide of illiberal nationalism is rising in eastern Europe, just one generation removed from life behind the  . Traditional defenders of the values of openness and liberty, the United Kingdom and the United States, were dealt shocking election results by the forces of isolation and nativism. If this trend against freedom is not combated and reversed, the world is headed into a new era of conflict between great powers, with all the human suffering that would entail. The free world is still ascendant—economically, politically, militarily—but if there is no will to leverage that power to make the world freer and safer for all, that   will continue to wane.

This is true of insects such as   and various   that ecologically are latecomers to   and are capable of breaking down the   in hair and feathers. When these insects invade skins, furs, and wool garments or carpets, they can become problems for humans. In many hot, dry climates, as in   or the plains of India, ripened   in the fields is invaded by certain beetles and moths. When the grain is harvested, these insects thrive in the grain stores. They can be carried throughout the world in commerce and have become universal pests of stored grain, dried fruit,  , and other products.   and disinfestation methods are used to control importation of such insects from grain-exporting countries. Many insects are   feeders, and, when the plants are of agricultural importance, humans are often forced to compete with these insects. Populations of insects are limited by such factors as unfavourable  , predators and  , and viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases, as well as many other factors that operate to make insect populations stable.   that encourage the planting of ever larger areas to single crops, which provides virtually unlimited food resources, has removed some of these regulating factors and allowed the rate of   of insects that attack those crops to increase. This increases the probability of great infestations of certain insect pests. Many natural forests, which form similar giant monocultures, always seem to have been subject to periodic outbreaks of destructive insects. In some agricultural monocultures, nonnative insect pests have been accidentally introduced along with a crop but without also bringing along its full range of natural enemies.

The beetle, which fed on the buffalo burr plant, adapted itself to a newly introduced and abundant diet of potatoes and thus escaped from all previous controlling factors. Similar situations often have been controlled by determining the major predators or parasites of an alien insect   in its country of origin and introducing them as control agents. A classic example is the cottony-cushion scale, which threatened the California citrus industry in 1886. A predatory  , the   ( ), was introduced from  , and within a year or two the   had virtually disappeared. The success was repeated in every country where the scale insect had become established without its predators. In eastern Canada in the early 1940s the European  spruce sawfly ( ), which had caused   damage, was completely controlled by the spontaneous appearance of a   disease, perhaps unknowingly introduced from Europe. This event led to increased interest in using insect diseases as potential means of managing pest populations.

Biotechnology is the use of   to solve problems and make useful products. The most prominent approach used is genetic engineering, which enables scientists to tailor an organism’s   at will. Biotechnology is particularly important in the field of medicine, where it facilitates the production of therapeutic proteins and other drugs. Synthetic   and synthetic   and diagnostic tests to detect various diseases are just some examples of how biotechnology is impacting medicine. Biotechnology has also proved helpful in refining industrial processes, in environmental cleanup, and in agricultural production. The first molecular and cellular tools of modern biotechnology emerged in the 1960s and ’70s. A fledgling “biotech”   began to coalesce in the mid- to late 1970s. Modern biotechnology stands in contrast to older forms of “biotechnology,” which emerged thousands of years ago, when humans began to domesticate plants and animals.

The most prominent area of biotechnology is the production of therapeutic proteins and other drugs through  . People have been harnessing biological processes to improve their   for some 10,000 years, beginning with the first agricultural  . Approximately 6,000 years ago, humans began to tap the biological processes of microorganisms in order to make bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese and to preserve dairy products. But such processes are not what is meant today by  , a term first widely applied to the molecular and cellular technologies that began to emerge in the 1960s and ’70s. A fledgling “biotech”   began to coalesce in the mid- to late 1970s, led by  , a   company established in 1976 by Robert A. Swanson and Herbert W. Boyer to commercialize the   pioneered by Boyer,  , and Stanley N. Cohen. Early companies such as Genentech, Amgen, Biogen, Cetus, and Genex began by   genetically engineered substances primarily for medical and environmental uses. For more than a decade, the biotechnology industry was dominated by      , or  . This technique consists of splicing the   for a useful   (often a human protein) into  production cells—such as yeast,  , or mammalian cells in culture—which then begin to produce the protein in volume. In the process of splicing a gene into a production  , a new organism is created. At first, biotechnology investors and researchers were uncertain about whether the courts would permit them to     on organisms; after all, patents were not allowed on new organisms that happened to be discovered and identified in nature. But, in 1980, the  , in the case of   v.  , resolved the matter by ruling that “a live human-made microorganism is patentable subject matter.” This decision spawned a wave of new biotechnology firms and the infant industry’s first investment boom. In 1982 recombinant   became the first product made through genetic engineering to secure approval from the U.S.   (FDA). Since then, dozens of genetically engineered protein medications have been commercialized around the world, including recombinant versions of  , clotting factors, proteins for   the production of red and white blood cells,  s, and clot-dissolving agents. In the early years, the main achievement of biotechnology was the ability to produce naturally occurring therapeutic molecules in larger quantities than could be derived from conventional sources such as  , animal organs, and human cadavers. Recombinant proteins are also less likely to be contaminated with pathogens or to provoke allergic reactions. Today, biotechnology researchers seek to discover the root molecular causes of disease and to intervene precisely at that level. Sometimes this means producing therapeutic proteins that augment the body’s own supplies or that make up for genetic deficiencies, as in the first generation of biotech medications. (Gene therapy—insertion of genes   a needed protein into a patient’s body or cells—is a related approach.) The biotechnology industry has also expanded its research into the development of traditional   and   that stop the progress of a disease. Successful production of monoclonal antibodies was one of the most important techniques of biotechnology to emerge during the last quarter of the 20th century. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies and their availability in quantity have made it possible to devise sensitive assays for an enormous range of biologically important substances and to distinguish cells from one another by identifying previously unknown marker molecules on their surfaces. Such advances were made possible through the study of genes ( ), the proteins that they   (proteomics), and the larger biological pathways in which they act.

					 Scientists familiar with insects realize the difficulty in attempting to estimate individual numbers of insects beyond areas of a few acres or a few square miles in extent. Figures soon become so large as to be incomprehensible. The large populations and great variety of insects are related to their small size, high rates of reproduction, and   of suitable food supplies. Insects abound in the tropics, both in numbers of different kinds and in numbers of individuals. If the insects (including the young and adults of all forms) are counted on a square yard (0.84 square metre) of rich moist surface soil, 500 are found easily and 2,000 are not unusual in soil samples in the north temperate zone. This amounts to roughly 4 million insects on one moist acre (0.41 hectare). In such an area only an occasional  ,  , or large  , supergiants among insects, probably would be noticed. Only a few thousand  , those that attack people’s crops, herds, and products and those that carry disease, interfere with   life seriously enough to require control measures. Insects are adapted to every land and freshwater habitat where food is available, from   to  , from glacial fields and cold mountain streams to  , lowland ponds and  . Many live in brackish water up to   the salinity of seawater, a few live on the surface of seawater, and some     can live in pools of crude  , where they eat other insects that fall in.

Viewed zoologically, we humans are  , a  -bearing upright-walking   that lives on the ground and very likely first evolved in   about 315,000 years ago. We are now the only living members of what many zoologists refer to as the human tribe,  , but there is     evidence to indicate that we were preceded for millions of years by other hominins, such as  ,  , and other species of  , and that our species also lived for a time contemporaneously with at least one other member of our  ,   (the  ). In addition, we and our predecessors have always shared Earth with other apelike primates, from the modern-day   to the long-extinct  . That we and the extinct hominins are somehow related and that we and the  , both living and  , are also somehow related is accepted by anthropologists and biologists everywhere.   the exact nature of our   relationships has been the subject of debate and investigation since the great British naturalist   published his monumental books   (1859) and   (1871).

Content: As you watch someone carelessly munching on an apple core, some vague alarm bells go off in your head. Didn't you hear somewhere that apple seeds are poisonous?     seeds (and the seeds of related plants, such as   and  ) contain amygdalin, a cyanogenic   composed of   and sugar. When metabolized in the  , this chemical degrades into highly poisonous   (HCN). A lethal dose of HCN can kill within minutes. Thankfully, there are several factors that make death-by-apple-seed very unlikely. First, the amygdalin is accessible only if the seeds have been crushed or chewed; a whole unbroken seed will pass right through. Second, the human body can process HCN in small doses, so a couple of chewed seeds are usually completely harmless. Finally, the average adult would need to eat anywhere from 150 to several thousand crushed seeds (depending on the apple variety) to be at risk of  . The average apple contains only about five to eight seeds. So unless someone is eating their 18th consecutive apple core and has been meticulously chewing all the seeds, they should be fine with their occasional absentminded core chomping.

The bioengineer must be well grounded in biology and have engineering knowledge that is broad, drawing upon electrical, chemical, mechanical, and other engineering  . The bioengineer may work in any of a large range of areas. One of these is the provision of   means to assist defective body functions—such as hearing aids, artificial limbs, and supportive or substitute organs. In another direction, the bioengineer may use engineering methods to achieve biosynthesis of animal or plant products—such as for fermentation processes. Before   the field of bioengineering was essentially unknown, and little communication or interaction existed between the engineer and the life scientist. A few exceptions, however, should be noted. The agricultural engineer and the chemical engineer, involved in fermentation processes, have always been bioengineers in the broadest sense of the definition since they deal with biological systems and work with biologists. The civil engineer, specializing in sanitation, has applied biological principles in the work. Mechanical engineers have worked with the medical profession for many years in the development of artificial limbs. Another area of   that falls in the field of bioengineering is the air-conditioning field. In the early 1920s engineers and physiologists were employed by the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers to study the effects of temperature and humidity on humans and to provide design   for heating and air-conditioning systems. Today there are many more examples of interaction between biology and engineering, particularly in the medical and life-support fields. In addition to an increased awareness of the need for communication between the engineer and the associate in the life sciences, there is an increasing recognition of the role the engineer can play in several of the biological fields, including human medicine, and, likewise, an awareness of the contributions biological   can make toward the solution of engineering problems. Much of the increase in bioengineering activity can be credited to electrical engineers. In the 1950s bioengineering meetings were dominated by sessions devoted to medical  . Medical instrumentation and medical electronics continue to be major areas of interest, but biological modeling, blood-flow  , prosthetics,   (dynamics of body motion and strength of materials), biological  , biomaterials, and other areas are now included in conference programs. Bioengineering developed out of specific desires or needs: the desire of surgeons to bypass the heart, the need for replacement organs, the requirement for life support in space, and many more. In most cases the early interaction and education were a result of personal contacts between physician, or physiologist, and engineer. Communication between the engineer and the life scientist was immediately recognized as a problem. Most engineers who wandered into the field in its early days probably had an exposure to biology through a high-school course and no further work. To overcome this problem, engineers began to study not only the subject matter but also the methods and techniques of their counterparts in medicine,  , psychology, and biology. Much of the information was self-taught or obtained through personal association and discussions. Finally, recognizing a need to assist in overcoming the communication barrier as well as to prepare engineers for the future, engineering schools developed courses and curricula in bioengineering.

In fact,   was the very name of  ’s 2014 documentary about our two contests. I defeated Deep Blue (4–2) in our first face-off in 1996. When the computer defeated me in the first of our six games, it marked the first time a machine had won a game against a world champion under classical tournament conditions. When the computer beat me in the decisive sixth game of our 1997 rematch, its 3.5–2.5 victory (winning two games, with three draws) marked the first time a computer had ever won a classical   against a world champion. When I lost the rematch, it was hailed by many as a momentous occasion for human progress on par with the Moon landing. I didn’t feel so enthusiastic about it myself, but I realized that while the era of intelligent machines was ending in  , it was only getting started in every other aspect of our lives. Real life—language, business, education, health—doesn’t have a tidy framework like chess. Artificial intelligence (AI) today begins with a huge amount of data and clever algorithms to analyze it, without strict pre-existing rules. Machine learning is pushing the frontier of what machines can do better than humans—medical diagnosis, legal research—and how it does it has limitless potential. This type of AI doesn’t care   something works,   it works. These machines even teach themselves better ways to learn, effectively coding themselves iteratively. Chess, still an AI bellwether, demonstrated this principle in astonishing fashion in late 2017, when the machine-learning algorithm   taught itself to play better than any existing program or human after four hours of playing against itself. Think about all the new ways of solving problems based on objective results instead of centuries of accumulated human dogma. This is a brave new world, one in which machines are doing things humans do not know how to teach them to do, one in which machines figure out the rules—and, if we are lucky, explain them to us. If this sounds threatening instead of amazing, you’ve been watching too many dystopian Hollywood movies. Humans will still set the goals and establish the priorities. We must ensure that our agnostic machines represent the best of our human morality. If we succeed, our new tools will make us smarter, enabling us to better understand our world and ourselves. Our real challenge is to avoid complacency, to keep thinking up new directions for AI to explore. And that’s one job that can never be done by a machine. One very real area of concern, however, is the political polarization of the world. Since I retired from professional chess, much of my life has been divided between   activism and investigations into human and machine  , and we are at a critical inflection point in both areas. The global rise of   threatens to roll back a half-century of democratic proliferation that was capped by the fall of the   in 1989 and the collapse of the   two years later. Today, freedom is under assault from all sides—geographically from the Americas to Europe to Asia, politically from both right and left, in regimes that have relatively little experience with democracy and in several of the world’s freest states. The political center is being hollowed out, with extremist positions leading to backlash and whiplash. Over half the world’s population lives under nondemocratic regimes today. Even more troubling, that percentage has been rising. Autocratic regimes like my native Russia have become full-blown dictatorships. A tide of illiberal nationalism is rising in eastern Europe, just one generation removed from life behind the  . Traditional defenders of the values of openness and liberty, the United Kingdom and the United States, were dealt shocking election results by the forces of isolation and nativism. If this trend against freedom is not combated and reversed, the world is headed into a new era of conflict between great powers, with all the human suffering that would entail. The free world is still ascendant—economically, politically, militarily—but if there is no will to leverage that power to make the world freer and safer for all, that   will continue to wane.

Content: Born in 1903, four-year-old Herbert Graf witnessed the collapse of a horse who had been pulling a heavy cart. It was a traumatic experience for the boy, who subsequently developed a fear of horses. Additionally, Herbert’s father noted that he developed particular anxieties: Herbert felt uneasy without his mother around, had an intense fixation on male genitalia (especially those on horses), and described dreams of two giraffes—one healthy, another crumpled—in which he takes away the crumpled giraffe while the healthy one calls out to him. Herbert Graf, otherwise known as “Little Hans,” was the focus of psychoanalyst  ’s case study that supported his theory of the  . When the boy’s father described his son’s symptoms, Freud interpreted Herbert to be an example of a child experiencing this phenomenon. Freud described it as an intense attraction felt by young children toward their opposite-sex parents and an intense jealousy and combativeness toward their same-sex caretakers. Contextualized within his larger theory of psychosexual development, Freud argued that children are innately sexual beings who become fixated on different body areas before resolving the Oedipus complex and moving on to have adult romantic relationships—and he believed that Herbert Graf was the boy who could prove this.  The case study of Little Hans, who was among the very few children studied by Freud, became the defining case for Freud’s Oedipus complex. Freud argued that Herbert’s anxieties all stemmed from his foundational animosity toward his father. For instance, Freud claimed that Herbert’s phobia of horses represented a variation of castration anxiety—the fear that a horse, resembling his father, would punish him for desiring his mother by castrating him. Freud interpreted the giraffe dream as a reinvention of a fantasized relationship between Herbert and his parents: Herbert desires to be with the crumpled giraffe, representing his mother, while his father, manifested in the healthy giraffe, calls out from a distance. Though seemingly absurd and farfetched today, especially when used as evidence for a theory, the case of Little Hans was foundational in the legacy of Freud’s influential contributions to  . Freud himself stressed how much importance he placed on his theory,   that the “discovery of the repressed Oedipus complex…alone would give [psychoanalysis] a claim to be included among the precious new acquisitions of mankind.” But despite Freud’s comments, how valid and relevant is the Oedipus complex today? Sigmund Freud has always been a controversial figure. The Oedipus complex, a theory that suggests that every single person has deeply repressed incestuous instincts for their parents since childhood, is no less so. Critics of Freud have noted that, despite the case of Little Hans, there is very little empirical evidence to prove the theory’s validity. While Freud is viewed as a historically significant figure who was extremely influential in his field, his ideas are often regarded by academics and practitioners with less zeal.  Furthermore, modern developments in gender and sexuality studies have opposed many conclusions of Freudian psychoanalysis. For instance, Freud suggested that an incomplete resolution of the Oedipus complex can lead to homosexuality, caused by the child’s eventual identification with their opposite-sex parent instead of their same-sex one. This distinguishes homosexuality as a diversion from “normal” sexual development, and it further suggests sexuality as something that is shaped by traumatic or deviant childhood experiences. This idea differs from the modern consensus that homosexuality is a normal sexual experience. Another persistent critique of the Oedipus complex is its overwhelmingly masculine theme, with Freud’s original theory focusing almost exclusively on the sexual development of boys. When speaking of the female perspective in the Oedipus complex, Freud tended to frame it in masculine terms: for example, he describes girls as suffering from penis envy, a supposed realization that they do not possess a penis, which causes many anxieties that, Freud claimed, originate in girls’ unwelcome realization that they are not men like their fathers.

Biotechnology is the use of   to solve problems and make useful products. The most prominent approach used is genetic engineering, which enables scientists to tailor an organism’s   at will. Biotechnology is particularly important in the field of medicine, where it facilitates the production of therapeutic proteins and other drugs. Synthetic   and synthetic   and diagnostic tests to detect various diseases are just some examples of how biotechnology is impacting medicine. Biotechnology has also proved helpful in refining industrial processes, in environmental cleanup, and in agricultural production. The first molecular and cellular tools of modern biotechnology emerged in the 1960s and ’70s. A fledgling “biotech”   began to coalesce in the mid- to late 1970s. Modern biotechnology stands in contrast to older forms of “biotechnology,” which emerged thousands of years ago, when humans began to domesticate plants and animals. Humans have also long tapped the biological processes of microorganisms to make bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese. ,  the use of   to solve problems and make useful products. The most prominent area of biotechnology is the production of therapeutic proteins and other drugs through  . People have been harnessing biological processes to improve their   for some 10,000 years, beginning with the first agricultural  . Approximately 6,000 years ago, humans began to tap the biological processes of microorganisms in order to make bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese and to preserve dairy products. But such processes are not what is meant today by  , a term first widely applied to the molecular and cellular technologies that began to emerge in the 1960s and ’70s. A fledgling “biotech”   began to coalesce in the mid- to late 1970s, led by  , a   company established in 1976 by Robert A. Swanson and Herbert W. Boyer to commercialize the   pioneered by Boyer,  , and Stanley N. Cohen. Early companies such as Genentech, Amgen, Biogen, Cetus, and Genex began by   genetically engineered substances primarily for medical and environmental uses. For more than a decade, the biotechnology industry was dominated by      , or  . This technique consists of splicing the   for a useful   (often a human protein) into  production cells—such as yeast,  , or mammalian cells in culture—which then begin to produce the protein in volume. In the process of splicing a gene into a production  , a new organism is created. At first, biotechnology investors and researchers were uncertain about whether the courts would permit them to     on organisms; after all, patents were not allowed on new organisms that happened to be discovered and identified in nature. But, in 1980, the  , in the case of   v.  , resolved the matter by ruling that “a live human-made microorganism is patentable subject matter.” This decision spawned a wave of new biotechnology firms and the infant industry’s first investment boom. In 1982 recombinant   became the first product made through genetic engineering to secure approval from the U.S.   (FDA). Since then, dozens of genetically engineered protein medications have been commercialized around the world, including recombinant versions of  , clotting factors, proteins for   the production of red and white blood cells,  s, and clot-dissolving agents. In the early years, the main achievement of biotechnology was the ability to produce naturally occurring therapeutic molecules in larger quantities than could be derived from conventional sources such as  , animal organs, and human cadavers. Recombinant proteins are also less likely to be contaminated with pathogens or to provoke allergic reactions. Today, biotechnology researchers seek to discover the root molecular causes of disease and to intervene precisely at that level. Sometimes this means producing therapeutic proteins that augment the body’s own supplies or that make up for genetic deficiencies, as in the first generation of biotech medications. (Gene therapy—insertion of genes   a needed protein into a patient’s body or cells—is a related approach.) The biotechnology industry has also expanded its research into the development of traditional   and   that stop the progress of a disease. Successful production of monoclonal antibodies was one of the most important techniques of biotechnology to emerge during the last quarter of the 20th century. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies and their availability in quantity have made it possible to devise sensitive assays for an enormous range of biologically important substances and to distinguish cells from one another by identifying previously unknown marker molecules on their surfaces. Such advances were made possible through the study of genes ( ), the proteins that they   (proteomics), and the larger biological pathways in which they act.

Content: Born in 1903, four-year-old Herbert Graf witnessed the collapse of a horse who had been pulling a heavy cart. It was a traumatic experience for the boy, who subsequently developed a fear of horses. Additionally, Herbert’s father noted that he developed particular anxieties: Herbert felt uneasy without his mother around, had an intense fixation on male genitalia (especially those on horses), and described dreams of two giraffes—one healthy, another crumpled—in which he takes away the crumpled giraffe while the healthy one calls out to him. Herbert Graf, otherwise known as “Little Hans,” was the focus of psychoanalyst  ’s case study that supported his theory of the  . When the boy’s father described his son’s symptoms, Freud interpreted Herbert to be an example of a child experiencing this phenomenon. Freud described it as an intense attraction felt by young children toward their opposite-sex parents and an intense jealousy and combativeness toward their same-sex caretakers. Contextualized within his larger theory of psychosexual development, Freud argued that children are innately sexual beings who become fixated on different body areas before resolving the Oedipus complex and moving on to have adult romantic relationships—and he believed that Herbert Graf was the boy who could prove this.  The case study of Little Hans, who was among the very few children studied by Freud, became the defining case for Freud’s Oedipus complex. Freud argued that Herbert’s anxieties all stemmed from his foundational animosity toward his father. For instance, Freud claimed that Herbert’s phobia of horses represented a variation of castration anxiety—the fear that a horse, resembling his father, would punish him for desiring his mother by castrating him. Freud interpreted the giraffe dream as a reinvention of a fantasized relationship between Herbert and his parents: Herbert desires to be with the crumpled giraffe, representing his mother, while his father, manifested in the healthy giraffe, calls out from a distance. Though seemingly absurd and farfetched today, especially when used as evidence for a theory, the case of Little Hans was foundational in the legacy of Freud’s influential contributions to  . Freud himself stressed how much importance he placed on his theory,   that the “discovery of the repressed Oedipus complex…alone would give [psychoanalysis] a claim to be included among the precious new acquisitions of mankind.” But despite Freud’s comments, how valid and relevant is the Oedipus complex today? Sigmund Freud has always been a controversial figure. The Oedipus complex, a theory that suggests that every single person has deeply repressed incestuous instincts for their parents since childhood, is no less so. Critics of Freud have noted that, despite the case of Little Hans, there is very little empirical evidence to prove the theory’s validity. While Freud is viewed as a historically significant figure who was extremely influential in his field, his ideas are often regarded by academics and practitioners with less zeal.  Furthermore, modern developments in gender and sexuality studies have opposed many conclusions of Freudian psychoanalysis. For instance, Freud suggested that an incomplete resolution of the Oedipus complex can lead to homosexuality, caused by the child’s eventual identification with their opposite-sex parent instead of their same-sex one. This distinguishes homosexuality as a diversion from “normal” sexual development, and it further suggests sexuality as something that is shaped by traumatic or deviant childhood experiences. This idea differs from the modern consensus that homosexuality is a normal sexual experience. Another persistent critique of the Oedipus complex is its overwhelmingly masculine theme, with Freud’s original theory focusing almost exclusively on the sexual development of boys. When speaking of the female perspective in the Oedipus complex, Freud tended to frame it in masculine terms: for example, he describes girls as suffering from penis envy, a supposed realization that they do not possess a penis, which causes many anxieties that, Freud claimed, originate in girls’ unwelcome realization that they are not men like their fathers. Freud himself   that “psychology…is unable to solve the riddle of femininity,” elaborating on his extremely limited and somewhat problematic psychoanalytic work on (and disinterest in) the psychology of women.  Despite these criticisms, however, there is both empirical and anecdotal evidence that parents do have a significant impact on their children’s sexual tendencies. A   showed that male rats are sexually attracted to females with scents that remind them of their mothers, and a   suggests that people are more attracted to others who look like them and are also more inclined to find others more attractive after seeing a picture of their opposite-sex parent. So while the case of Little Hans, more than a century later, may not escape the intense scrutiny of modern empirical analysis, recent evidence perhaps can prove what Sigmund Freud and Herbert Graf could not.

Content:  Within the next century or two, we  humans are likely to upgrade ourselves into gods and change the most basic principles of the evolution of life. Traditional mythologies depicted gods as powerful beings that could design and create life according to their wishes. In the coming two centuries we will probably learn how to engineer and manufacture various life forms according to our wishes. We will use  bioengineering in order to create new kinds of organic beings; we will use direct brain-computer interfaces in order to create cyborgs (beings that combine organic and inorganic parts); and advances in machine learning and   might even allow us to set in motion the creation of completely inorganic beings. The main products of the future economy will not be food, textiles, and vehicles but rather bodies, brains, and minds. This will be not just the greatest revolution in history but the greatest revolution in biology since the appearance of life on Earth. For four billion years life was governed by the laws of natural selection. During all these eons, whether you were a virus or a dinosaur, you evolved according to the principles of natural selection. In addition, no matter what strange and bizarre shapes life took, it remained confined to the organic realm. Whether a cactus or a whale, you were made of organic compounds and you remained subject to the laws of organic chemistry. In the next two centuries, however, science could be ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds—but   intelligent design and the intelligent design of our cloud computing. In the process,   itself will likely disappear. In 200 years Earth will probably be dominated by entities more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals or chimpanzees. Today we still share with Neanderthals and chimpanzees most of our bodily structures, physical abilities, and mental faculties. Not only are our hands, eyes, and brains distinctly hominid, but so are our lust, our love, our anger, and our social bonds. Within 200 years the combination of  biotechnology and AI might result in bodily, physical, and mental traits that completely break free of the hominid mold. For example, brain-computer interfaces could result in distributed bodies—beings whose organs are spread widely in space. Some believe that consciousness might be severed from any organic structure and could surf cyberspace free of traditional biological and physical constraints. On the other hand, we might witness the decoupling of intelligence from  consciousness.  Intelligence is the ability to solve problems. Consciousness is the ability to feel things, such as pain, joy, love, and anger. In mammals the two go together. Mammals solve problems by feeling things. But computers are very different. So far the amazing development of computer intelligence has not been accompanied by any development of computer consciousness. There might be several alternative ways leading to  superintelligence, only some of which pass through the straits of consciousness. For millions of years mammalian evolution has been slowly sailing along the conscious route. The evolution of inorganic life forms, however, may completely bypass these narrow straits, charting a different and much quicker course to superintelligence. We might end up with a world dominated by superintelligent but completely  nonconscious  entities.  Encyclopædia Britannica Anniversary Edition: 250 Years of Excellence (1768–2018).

The bioengineer must be well grounded in biology and have engineering knowledge that is broad, drawing upon electrical, chemical, mechanical, and other engineering  . The bioengineer may work in any of a large range of areas. One of these is the provision of   means to assist defective body functions—such as hearing aids, artificial limbs, and supportive or substitute organs. In another direction, the bioengineer may use engineering methods to achieve biosynthesis of animal or plant products—such as for fermentation processes. Before   the field of bioengineering was essentially unknown, and little communication or interaction existed between the engineer and the life scientist. A few exceptions, however, should be noted. The agricultural engineer and the chemical engineer, involved in fermentation processes, have always been bioengineers in the broadest sense of the definition since they deal with biological systems and work with biologists. The civil engineer, specializing in sanitation, has applied biological principles in the work. Mechanical engineers have worked with the medical profession for many years in the development of artificial limbs. Another area of   that falls in the field of bioengineering is the air-conditioning field. In the early 1920s engineers and physiologists were employed by the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers to study the effects of temperature and humidity on humans and to provide design   for heating and air-conditioning systems. Today there are many more examples of interaction between biology and engineering, particularly in the medical and life-support fields. In addition to an increased awareness of the need for communication between the engineer and the associate in the life sciences, there is an increasing recognition of the role the engineer can play in several of the biological fields, including human medicine, and, likewise, an awareness of the contributions biological   can make toward the solution of engineering problems. Much of the increase in bioengineering activity can be credited to electrical engineers. In the 1950s bioengineering meetings were dominated by sessions devoted to medical  . Medical instrumentation and medical electronics continue to be major areas of interest, but biological modeling, blood-flow  , prosthetics,   (dynamics of body motion and strength of materials), biological  , biomaterials, and other areas are now included in conference programs. Bioengineering developed out of specific desires or needs: the desire of surgeons to bypass the heart, the need for replacement organs, the requirement for life support in space, and many more. In most cases the early interaction and education were a result of personal contacts between physician, or physiologist, and engineer. Communication between the engineer and the life scientist was immediately recognized as a problem. Most engineers who wandered into the field in its early days probably had an exposure to biology through a high-school course and no further work. To overcome this problem, engineers began to study not only the subject matter but also the methods and techniques of their counterparts in medicine,  , psychology, and biology. Much of the information was self-taught or obtained through personal association and discussions. Finally, recognizing a need to assist in overcoming the communication barrier as well as to prepare engineers for the future, engineering schools developed courses and curricula in bioengineering.

Content: Traditionally favored by private and parochial institutions,   are being adopted by US public schools in increasing numbers. According to a 2020 report, the percentage of public schools that required school uniforms jumped from 12% in the 1999-2000 school year to 20% in the 2017-18 school year. School uniforms were most frequently required by elementary schools (23%), followed by middle (18%), and high schools (10%). The first recorded use of   in education may have been in England in 1222, when the Archbishop of Canterbury mandated that students wear a robe-like outfit called the “cappa clausa.” The origin of the modern school uniform can be traced to 16th Century England, when the impoverished “charity children” attending the Christ’s Hospital boarding school wore blue cloaks reminiscent of the cassocks worn by clergy, along with yellow stockings. As of Sep. 2014, students at Christ’s Hospital were still wearing the same uniform, and according to the school it is the oldest school uniform still in use. When Christ’s Hospital surveyed its students in 2011, 95% voted to keep the traditional uniforms. School uniforms in the United States followed the traditional use of uniforms established in England and were generally limited to private and parochial schools. One exception was found in government-run boarding schools for   children, first established in the late 1800s, where the children, who had been removed from their families, were dressed in military-style uniforms. According to figures released in 2018 by the National Center for Education Statistics, the total number of public schools nationwide requiring students to wear school uniforms increased from 12% during the 1999-2000 school year to 21% during the 2015-2016 school year. In 2015-2016, 25% of public primary schools enforced a uniform policy, as did 20% of public middle schools and 12% of public high schools. A higher proportion of schools located in cities had mandatory uniforms in 2015-2016 than schools in suburban, town, and rural areas. Mandatory   were far more prevalent in “high-poverty” schools (in which 76% of students were eligible for reduced-cost or free lunch programs) than in “low-poverty” schools. Among the US cities with the highest use of   in public schools are Philadelphia (100% of schools), New Orleans (95%), Cleveland (85%), Chicago (80%), Boston (65%), and Miami (60%). The number of schools with “strict dress codes” has also increased, from 47% in 2000 to 57% in 2010.

Content: A cashless society is one in which  , in the form of physical banknotes and  , is not accepted in any financial transaction. Instead, people and businesses transfer   to one another digitally—via   or   cards, electronic money transfers,  , or online and mobile payment services, such as   and Apple Pay. Although no existing society is cashless, many economists believe that consumer preferences, competitive pressures on businesses, profit seeking by  , and government policies designed to facilitate cashless transactions will soon lead to at least a few cashless societies. There are various measures of cashlessness, yielding different rankings of countries along a “cashless continuum,” but most experts agree that Sweden is now closest to the cashless ideal. Cash is now used in less than 15 percent of transactions in that country, and the value of cash in circulation has declined significantly in the 21st century, now representing about 1 percent of GDP. Swedish retailers and restaurants are now permitted to refuse cash payments merely by posting a sign, and more than half of all Swedish bank branches no longer handle cash. To facilitate the transition to cashlessness,   in some countries have introduced government-backed digital   to replace or complement banknotes and coins. Proponents of a cashless society argue that digital transactions are more convenient for both customers and businesses and that cashlessness would cut down on many criminal activities. They also maintain that the trend toward cashlessness is unstoppable, given the increasing digitization of economies and consumers’ growing preference for conducting daily business with mobile devices. The trend has been propelled, however, by banks that have intentionally made cash transactions less convenient for their customers (e.g., by closing branches and removing ATMs) to encourage the use of digital services that are more profitable. The global coronavirus pandemic that began in 2020 also contributed heavily to an increase in touchless and cashless transactions. But there are potential drawbacks to a cashless society. First, it would largely exclude “unbanked” (mostly poor) persons, who do not use or cannot obtain a bank account. Second, it could invite serious breaches of  , because few purchases and sales would be anonymous. Third, even minor technological glitches could block access to funds, and systemic failures due to natural disasters or massive hacking could make all purchases and payments impossible. Fourth, during a severe economic crisis threatening the solvency of major banks, depositors would be unable to rescue their money by withdrawing it in cash. Nor could depositors prevent troubled banks from taking a portion of their deposits in “bail-in” scenarios, under which the institution’s shareholders and creditors, including depositors, are held responsible for its debts (in the U.S., up to $250,000 of each deposit would be protected from such seizures). Finally, ordinary depositors would not be able to protect themselves from negative   rates, which central banks in some countries (e.g., Japan) have imposed to combat   or deflation after cuts in positive interest rates to near zero have failed. Negative interest rates permit private banks to charge depositors what amounts to a fee for holding their money, thus encouraging them to spend and invest. Indeed, some economists consider that to be an argument in favor of a cashless society, as it would make painfully deep negative interest rates workable because they could not be avoided through cash withdrawals.

Content:  Within the next century or two, we  humans are likely to upgrade ourselves into gods and change the most basic principles of the evolution of life. Traditional mythologies depicted gods as powerful beings that could design and create life according to their wishes. In the coming two centuries we will probably learn how to engineer and manufacture various life forms according to our wishes. We will use  bioengineering in order to create new kinds of organic beings; we will use direct brain-computer interfaces in order to create cyborgs (beings that combine organic and inorganic parts); and advances in machine learning and   might even allow us to set in motion the creation of completely inorganic beings. The main products of the future economy will not be food, textiles, and vehicles but rather bodies, brains, and minds. This will be not just the greatest revolution in history but the greatest revolution in biology since the appearance of life on Earth. For four billion years life was governed by the laws of natural selection. During all these eons, whether you were a virus or a dinosaur, you evolved according to the principles of natural selection. In addition, no matter what strange and bizarre shapes life took, it remained confined to the organic realm. Whether a cactus or a whale, you were made of organic compounds and you remained subject to the laws of organic chemistry. In the next two centuries, however, science could be ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds—but   intelligent design and the intelligent design of our cloud computing. In the process,   itself will likely disappear. In 200 years Earth will probably be dominated by entities more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals or chimpanzees. Today we still share with Neanderthals and chimpanzees most of our bodily structures, physical abilities, and mental faculties. Not only are our hands, eyes, and brains distinctly hominid, but so are our lust, our love, our anger, and our social bonds. Within 200 years the combination of  biotechnology and AI might result in bodily, physical, and mental traits that completely break free of the hominid mold. For example, brain-computer interfaces could result in distributed bodies—beings whose organs are spread widely in space. Some believe that consciousness might be severed from any organic structure and could surf cyberspace free of traditional biological and physical constraints. On the other hand, we might witness the decoupling of intelligence from  consciousness.  Intelligence is the ability to solve problems. Consciousness is the ability to feel things, such as pain, joy, love, and anger. In mammals the two go together. Mammals solve problems by feeling things. But computers are very different. So far the amazing development of computer intelligence has not been accompanied by any development of computer consciousness. There might be several alternative ways leading to  superintelligence, only some of which pass through the straits of consciousness. For millions of years mammalian evolution has been slowly sailing along the conscious route. The evolution of inorganic life forms, however, may completely bypass these narrow straits, charting a different and much quicker course to superintelligence. We might end up with a world dominated by superintelligent but completely  nonconscious  entities.  Encyclopædia Britannica Anniversary Edition: 250 Years of Excellence (1768–2018).

As a result of his public philosophizing in Athens, he was sentenced to death by the city’s democratic government for “impiety” and “corrupting the youth.” He could have saved himself by promising to cease philosophizing or by escaping into exile, but he refused, preferring to drink the deadly hemlock out of respect for the law. Beyond his reputation as a philosophical hero, Socrates is important for reorienting Greek philosophy toward ethical concerns and indeed for insisting that the cultivation of virtue, the “care of the soul,” is overwhelmingly the most important obligation of every human being. He famously asserted at his trial, in defiance of his accusers, that the unexamined life is not worth living. His penetrating style of exploring philosophical questions in conversation, typically exposing contradictions in the positions of his interlocutors, is called the Socratic method. *Socrates wrote nothing. *What is known of his views is inferred from, among other sources, the early dialogues of  , in which “Socrates” is the main character. *Socrates held that virtue is a kind of knowledge and that anyone who knows what virtue is cannot help but act virtuously.

Plato’s foremost contribution to philosophy was his theory of  , which posited a realm of ideal, perfect, and changeless entities standing behind the world of ordinary experience. In addition to being a great philosopher, Plato was also a literary artist of the highest rank: he is a major figure in the history of  . *Plato’s philosophical works were written as dialogues, in most of which the principal character and main speaker is “Socrates.” *Plato himself never appears as a character in any of the dialogues. *Plato’s philosophy is the source of many famous literary tropes and myths, including the notion of Platonic love, the  , and the metaphor of the Cave (the world of experience is like a shadow cast on a cave wall by real but unseen objects).

According to some early modern philosophical theories and commonsense views, minds are not   to scientific study because they are immaterial or supernatural, as are   and spirits (   ). Cognitive science, in contrast, treats the   as wholly material. It aims to collect   bearing on mental processes and phenomena and to develop theories that explain that evidence, which can come from many  . Psychologists, for example, collect behavioral evidence in studies of language comprehension,   making, social interaction, and emotional experience. Linguists systematically gather evidence about how people produce and understand sentences that are well-structured and meaningful. Neuroscientists use   and other techniques to investigate the neural activity that accompanies different kinds of thought. And anthropologists study the nature of cognition as it occurs in many different cultural  . The contributions of   and computer science to the investigation of cognition are primarily theoretical. Philosophy asks very general questions about the nature of knowledge ( ), reality ( ), and   ( ), among other topics. Many of these questions are directly relevant to how the mind works or to how it might work better. For example, a central epistemological question is how minds gain knowledge of the external world, and a central   question is whether mind and body are fundamentally different kinds of things.  has been very important in cognitive science for two reasons. First, the notion of computation has been invaluable for developing ideas about how thinking might be a natural process. Previously, scientific theories of the mind relied on clumsy and unproductive   with mechanical devices such as   and electronic  . The advent of   made it possible to see how a mechanical device could solve complex problems by manipulating symbols, or representations, according to algorithmic procedures (computations), generating productive analogies for how minds might work in similar ways.  Standard programming languages, for example, allowed for sequences of “IF…THEN…” instructions, which suggest a model of how people make plans (   ).  Second, computers themselves have been useful for testing scientific   about mental organization and functioning. A given   is modeled in a program by constructing   that mimic the entities and processes the hypothesis proposes. The program is then run on a computer, and if the computer’s output is similar in appropriate ways to real human performance, the hypothesis is considered to be supported.  theories of the mind are invaluable for guiding practice in many applied domains, including  , or   (   );   and  ; and  , in particular the design of tools and other devices that can be used effectively without placing excessive demands on people’s mental capacities (   ). Legal and medical reasoning (the reasoning involved in diagnosing and treating illness) also have been investigated by means of both psychological experiments and computational models. Cognitive science is particularly central to   because of the importance of   such as   and  , whose explanation and treatment require an understanding of the cognitive and neural processes that underlie the operations of healthy minds. Attempts to understand the mind can be traced to the ancient Greeks, most notably to   and  . Of the two, Aristotle was the more scientific, tying his theories about mental processes more closely to observation than to abstract speculation. With the rise of   in the 17th and 18th centuries, philosophers such as   and   attempted to develop accounts of mental operations that would be as objective as    , but their efforts were hampered by a lack of   experimental methods and theoretical ideas. Scientific psychology did not arise until the mid-19th century, when the German physiologist   and others developed more rigorous methods for conducting psychological experiments. In the 1920s and ’30s, much research in psychology and linguistics, among other  , was dominated by an ultraexperimental approach called  , which rejected theorizing about “invisible” mental processes and emphasized the formulation of general laws that govern observable  . By the late 1950s, however, it had become clear that behaviourists could not even explain how rats learn to run mazes much less how humans learn complex behaviours such as those involved in language use. The modern origins of cognitive science lie in the mid-1950s, when a brilliant group of interdisciplinary thinkers began to apply ideas from the theory of computation to the scientific explanation of human thought. The computer scientists and psychologists  ,  ,  , and   pioneered the new field of  , which was founded at an academic conference at   in 1956 with the ultimate aim of building computers and   that could perform tasks commonly associated with  . The psychologist   and the theoretical linguist   also developed computational   to behaviourist theories in their fields. These six figures have since been recognized as the founders of cognitive science. The term itself, however, was not coined until the 1970s, when the interdisciplinary field became more formally organized. During this period the Cognitive Science Society and the journal   were founded, and programs and departments of cognitive science were established at many universities. By the late 20th century, cognitive science had become a flourishing academic enterprise with hundreds of departments throughout the world and numerous international societies, journals, and conferences.

A common goal in defining any   concept is a statement that corresponds to common usage. Acceptance of that aim, however, entails some peril. It implicitly assumes that common language categorizes in scientifically meaningful ways; that the word  , for example, corresponds to a definite psychological process. However, there appears to be good reason to doubt the validity of this assumption. The phenomena of learning are so varied and   that their inclusion in a single category may not be warranted. Recognizing this danger (and the   that no definition of learning is likely to be totally satisfactory) a definition proposed in 1961 by G.A.  Kimble may be considered representative: Learning is a relatively permanent change in a behavioral   that occurs as a result of reinforced practice. Although the definition is useful, it still leaves problems. The definition may be helpful by indicating that the change need not be an improvement; addictions and   are learned as well as high-level skills and useful knowledge. The phrase relatively permanent serves to exclude temporary behavioral changes that may depend on such factors as fatigue, the effects of drugs, or alterations in motives. The word potentiality covers effects that do not appear at once; one might learn about tourniquets by reading a first-aid manual and put the information to use later. To say that learning occurs as a result of practice excludes the effects of physiological development, aging, and brain damage. The stipulation that practice must be   serves to distinguish learning from the opposed loss of unreinforced habits. Reinforcement objectively refers to any condition—often reward or punishment—that may promote learning. However, the definition raises difficulties. How permanent is relatively permanent? Suppose one looks up an address, writes it on an envelope, but five minutes later has to look it up again to be sure it is correct. Does this qualify as relatively permanent? While commonly accepted as learning, it seems to violate the definition. What exactly is the result that occurs with practice? Is it a change in the  ? Is it a matter of providing stimuli that can evoke responses they previously would not? Does it mean developing associations, gaining insights, or gaining new perspective? Such questions serve to distinguish Kimble’s descriptive definition from theoretical attempts to define learning by identifying the nature of its underlying process. These may be neurophysiological, perceptual, or associationistic; they begin to   theoretical issues and to identify the bases for and   of learning. (The processes of perceptual learning are treated in the article  .) Even the simplest animals display such primitive forms of adaptive activity as  , the elimination of practiced responses. For example, a paramecium can learn to escape from a narrow glass tube to get to food. Learning in this case consists of the elimination (habituation) of unnecessary movements. Habituation also has been demonstrated for mammals in which control normally exercised by higher (brain) centres has been impaired by severing the  . For example, repeated application of   to the paw of a cat so treated leads to habituation of the reflex   reaction. Whether single-celled animals or cats that function only through the spinal cord are capable of higher forms of learning is a matter of controversy. Sporadic reports that conditioned responses may be possible among such animals have been sharply debated. At higher evolutionary levels the range of phenomena called learning is more extensive. Many mammalian species display the following varieties of learning. This is the form of learning studied by   (1849–1936). Some neutral  , such as a bell, is presented just before delivery of some effective stimulus (say, food or acid placed in the mouth of a dog). A response such as salivation, originally   only by the effective stimulus, eventually appears when the initially neutral stimulus is presented. The response is said to have become conditioned. Classical conditioning seems easiest to establish for involuntary reactions mediated by the  . This indicates learning to obtain reward or to avoid punishment. Laboratory examples of such conditioning among small mammals or birds are common. Rats or pigeons may be taught to press levers for food; they also learn to avoid or terminate electric shock. In the form of learning called chaining the subject is required to make a series of responses in a definite order. For example, a sequence of correct turns in a maze is to be mastered, or a list of words is to be learned in specific sequence. Within limits, laboratory animals can be taught to regulate the force with which they press a lever or to control the speed at which they run down an alley. Such skills are learned when a reward is made   on quantitatively constrained performance. Among human learners complex, precise skills (  tying shoelaces) are routine. In   learning the subject is reinforced to respond only to selected sensory characteristics of stimuli.   that can be established in this way may be quite subtle. Pigeons, for example, can learn to discriminate differences in colours that are indistinguishable to human beings without the use of special devices. An organism is said to have learned a concept when it responds uniquely to all objects or events in a given logical class as distinct from other classes. Even geese can master such concepts as roundness and triangularity; after training, they can respond appropriately to round or triangular figures they have never seen before.

(born May 8, 1919,  ,  , U.S.—died February 11, 1989, New York City) American  , best known for his theory of  , according to which inconsistency between  , or between thoughts and actions, leads to discomfort (dissonance), which motivates changes in thoughts or behaviours. Festinger also made important contributions to the study of  , self-evaluation, and attitude change. Festinger graduated with a B.A. in   from the City College of New York in 1939. He then entered the  , where he studied with the German-born social psychologist   and obtained a Ph.D. in 1942. One year later he moved to the   to work as a statistician for the National Research Council’s Committee on the Selection and Training of Aircraft Pilots. He stayed there until the end of  . In 1945 Festinger became assistant professor at the Research Center for Group  , which was then headed by Lewin, at the   (MIT). The centre was committed to the application of psychological concepts and methods to solve social problems, and it attracted many talented students, including   and Harold Kelley. An important early research project was based on attitude surveys of residents in married student housing. The study documented a textbook phenomenon: friendships were more likely to occur the closer the people were physically (even by just a few yards). Similarity in attitudes was also critical: attitudes of residents tended to converge, but residents who held   attitudes were likely to be social isolates. One central idea for Festinger at this time was that group members acquired similar beliefs and opinions because of social pressures toward uniformity or fitting in. In his informal  , he proposed that people are susceptible to social pressures when they are attracted to a group. Such attraction occurs because some goals can be pursued successfully only with the cooperation of others or because groups provide validation about social reality, which is necessary because some opinions and beliefs cannot be tested directly or objectively (e.g., “Should abortion be legal?”; “Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?”). Assuming that people are attracted to a particular group, they could   for group uniformity or agreement by trying to change other people’s opinions (communication), by modifying their own views to match those of other group members (opinion change), or by rejecting divergent others as appropriate references (rejection). Such pressures should be greater in attractive groups and increase as an issue becomes more relevant to a group’s goals. To test the theory, Festinger and his students conducted a series of laboratory experiments. Groups (or clubs) were formed of previously unacquainted individuals who were asked to discuss various issues. Factors such as types of goals, need for social reality, attractiveness, issue relevance, and so on were manipulated. In some experiments, accomplices posed as subjects and played scripted roles as group members with deviating or   opinions. Although precedents for this ambitious research program existed in earlier work by Lewin and the Turkish-born social psychologist Muzafer Sherif, Festinger magnified the experimenter’s role as playwright and stage director. For his dissertation, Schachter, under Festinger’s direction, placed accomplices in groups. One adopted the majority view (i.e., the “mode”) from the beginning, another initially voiced a deviant view but over the course of the discussion adopted the consensual position (i.e., the “slider”), and a third (the “deviate”) maintained the opposing view. Observers coded group discussion behaviours. The actual subjects tried to persuade the other discussion partners. The mode was readily accepted, as was the slider after adopting the majority view. Initially, much communication was directed at the deviate, but communication declined when the deviate proved impossible to convince, and the deviate was nominated for the most undesirable club assignments. Consistent with the theory, group goals or social reality were achieved by striving for group  , the pressures to obtain uniformity were   via different behavioral routes, and deviates were rejected. This experiment reflects several features of Festinger’s research. Festinger realized that progress in any   required methods appropriate to that field. Accordingly,   needed its own experimental approach. Following Lewin’s lead, he conceived of the new   as a kind of experimental theatre, with cover stories, accomplices, and deception to control for confounding factors and to create a situation that was perceived as psychologically meaningful to the subject. After Lewin’s death in 1947, the Research Center for Group Dynamics, with most of its remaining faculty, moved to the  . In 1951 Festinger moved to a tenure-track position at the  , where Schachter was already on the faculty. At the University of Minnesota, Festinger developed social comparison theory, his second major contribution to social psychology. Informal social communication theory was about the power of the group over the person. In contrast, social comparison theory emphasized how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities against those of others. Social comparison theory posited that people evaluate their abilities and opinions by comparing them with those of others when it is not   to test them directly. Comparison leads to pressures toward uniformity (i.e., similarity), but the tendency to compare will cease if others are too different in dimensions that are related to the ability or opinion at issue. For opinions, agreement with others who presumably are also motivated to hold correct views tends to make people feel more confident. For abilities, observing those with similar abilities allows people to learn what actions they are capable of. Social comparison theory also recognizes a distinctive feature of abilities. People want to be slightly better than everyone else because the desire to be better or to improve is emphasized in Western  . This means that, in Western cultures, complete opinion agreement may be satisfactory to everyone, but completely equal abilities will not be—implying that “a state of social quiescence is never reached,” as Festinger put it.

In   learning the subject is reinforced to respond only to selected sensory characteristics of stimuli.   that can be established in this way may be quite subtle. Pigeons, for example, can learn to discriminate differences in colours that are indistinguishable to human beings without the use of special devices. An organism is said to have learned a concept when it responds uniquely to all objects or events in a given logical class as distinct from other classes. Even geese can master such concepts as roundness and triangularity; after training, they can respond appropriately to round or triangular figures they have never seen before.

Working with American psychologist and pediatrician  , Ames examined the   of creeping and crawling in infants (known as “prone progression”) for her doctoral dissertation. This work soon developed into the theme that became her life’s work—the appearance of relatively clear-cut stages of human development that follow each other in a defined and predictable pattern. In 1950 Ames and colleagues cofounded the  Gesell Institute of Child Development in  , Connecticut, to continue and promote Gesell’s work. There Ames served as director of research, as associate director, and later as director. After retirement she was president of the institute’s board. In 1951 Ames and pediatrician  Frances Ilg (Gesell Institute cofounder and researcher) began writing a nationally   newspaper column called “Child Behavior” (changed to “Parents Ask” after 1962), which lasted until 1973. From 1953 to the early 1990s, Ames wrote and cowrote numerous books and articles, and she appeared on several television and radio shows. Some of her best-known books include   (1974),   (1979),   (1982), and   (1985).

(born May 8, 1919,  ,  , U.S.—died February 11, 1989, New York City) American  , best known for his theory of  , according to which inconsistency between  , or between thoughts and actions, leads to discomfort (dissonance), which motivates changes in thoughts or behaviours. Festinger also made important contributions to the study of  , self-evaluation, and attitude change. Festinger graduated with a B.A. in   from the City College of New York in 1939. He then entered the  , where he studied with the German-born social psychologist   and obtained a Ph.D. in 1942. One year later he moved to the   to work as a statistician for the National Research Council’s Committee on the Selection and Training of Aircraft Pilots. He stayed there until the end of  . In 1945 Festinger became assistant professor at the Research Center for Group  , which was then headed by Lewin, at the   (MIT). The centre was committed to the application of psychological concepts and methods to solve social problems, and it attracted many talented students, including   and Harold Kelley. An important early research project was based on attitude surveys of residents in married student housing. The study documented a textbook phenomenon: friendships were more likely to occur the closer the people were physically (even by just a few yards). Similarity in attitudes was also critical: attitudes of residents tended to converge, but residents who held   attitudes were likely to be social isolates. One central idea for Festinger at this time was that group members acquired similar beliefs and opinions because of social pressures toward uniformity or fitting in. In his informal  , he proposed that people are susceptible to social pressures when they are attracted to a group. Such attraction occurs because some goals can be pursued successfully only with the cooperation of others or because groups provide validation about social reality, which is necessary because some opinions and beliefs cannot be tested directly or objectively (e.g., “Should abortion be legal?”; “Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?”). Assuming that people are attracted to a particular group, they could   for group uniformity or agreement by trying to change other people’s opinions (communication), by modifying their own views to match those of other group members (opinion change), or by rejecting divergent others as appropriate references (rejection). Such pressures should be greater in attractive groups and increase as an issue becomes more relevant to a group’s goals. To test the theory, Festinger and his students conducted a series of laboratory experiments. Groups (or clubs) were formed of previously unacquainted individuals who were asked to discuss various issues. Factors such as types of goals, need for social reality, attractiveness, issue relevance, and so on were manipulated. In some experiments, accomplices posed as subjects and played scripted roles as group members with deviating or   opinions. Although precedents for this ambitious research program existed in earlier work by Lewin and the Turkish-born social psychologist Muzafer Sherif, Festinger magnified the experimenter’s role as playwright and stage director. For his dissertation, Schachter, under Festinger’s direction, placed accomplices in groups. One adopted the majority view (i.e., the “mode”) from the beginning, another initially voiced a deviant view but over the course of the discussion adopted the consensual position (i.e., the “slider”), and a third (the “deviate”) maintained the opposing view. Observers coded group discussion behaviours. The actual subjects tried to persuade the other discussion partners. The mode was readily accepted, as was the slider after adopting the majority view. Initially, much communication was directed at the deviate, but communication declined when the deviate proved impossible to convince, and the deviate was nominated for the most undesirable club assignments. Consistent with the theory, group goals or social reality were achieved by striving for group  , the pressures to obtain uniformity were   via different behavioral routes, and deviates were rejected. This experiment reflects several features of Festinger’s research. Festinger realized that progress in any   required methods appropriate to that field. Accordingly,   needed its own experimental approach. Following Lewin’s lead, he conceived of the new   as a kind of experimental theatre, with cover stories, accomplices, and deception to control for confounding factors and to create a situation that was perceived as psychologically meaningful to the subject. After Lewin’s death in 1947, the Research Center for Group Dynamics, with most of its remaining faculty, moved to the  . In 1951 Festinger moved to a tenure-track position at the  , where Schachter was already on the faculty. At the University of Minnesota, Festinger developed social comparison theory, his second major contribution to social psychology. Informal social communication theory was about the power of the group over the person. In contrast, social comparison theory emphasized how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities against those of others. Social comparison theory posited that people evaluate their abilities and opinions by comparing them with those of others when it is not   to test them directly. Comparison leads to pressures toward uniformity (i.e., similarity), but the tendency to compare will cease if others are too different in dimensions that are related to the ability or opinion at issue. For opinions, agreement with others who presumably are also motivated to hold correct views tends to make people feel more confident. For abilities, observing those with similar abilities allows people to learn what actions they are capable of. Social comparison theory also recognizes a distinctive feature of abilities. People want to be slightly better than everyone else because the desire to be better or to improve is emphasized in Western  . This means that, in Western cultures, complete opinion agreement may be satisfactory to everyone, but completely equal abilities will not be—implying that “a state of social quiescence is never reached,” as Festinger put it.

Content: As you watch someone carelessly munching on an apple core, some vague alarm bells go off in your head. Didn't you hear somewhere that apple seeds are poisonous?     seeds (and the seeds of related plants, such as   and  ) contain amygdalin, a cyanogenic   composed of   and sugar. When metabolized in the  , this chemical degrades into highly poisonous   (HCN). A lethal dose of HCN can kill within minutes. Thankfully, there are several factors that make death-by-apple-seed very unlikely. First, the amygdalin is accessible only if the seeds have been crushed or chewed; a whole unbroken seed will pass right through. Second, the human body can process HCN in small doses, so a couple of chewed seeds are usually completely harmless. Finally, the average adult would need to eat anywhere from 150 to several thousand crushed seeds (depending on the apple variety) to be at risk of  . The average apple contains only about five to eight seeds. So unless someone is eating their 18th consecutive apple core and has been meticulously chewing all the seeds, they should be fine with their occasional absentminded core chomping.

(born January 11, 1842, New York, New York, U.S.—died August 26, 1910, Chocorua, New Hampshire) was an American philosopher and psychologist, a leader of the philosophical movement of pragmatism and a founder of the psychological movement of functionalism.      James was the eldest son of Henry James, an idiosyncratic and voluble man whose philosophical interests attracted him to the theology of Emanuel Swedenborg. One of William’s brothers was the novelist Henry James. The elder Henry James held an “antipathy to all ecclesiasticisms which he expressed with abounding scorn and irony throughout all his later years.” Both his physical and  ...(100 of 2488 words)

Content:  was a 16th-century seer. He and his prophecies—revered by some, ridiculed by others—are still well known today, centuries after he lived, and continue to be the subject of debate. Nostradamus was born in   in 1503. He first worked as a physician and began his medical practice in the 1530s, although he did so without a medical degree. He began making prophecies about 1547, and he published his prophecies in a book entitled   (1555). He wrote his prophecies in quatrains: four lines of rhyming verse. The quatrains were grouped in hundreds; each set of 100 quatrains was called a century. Nostradamus gained notoriety during his lifetime when some of his predictions appeared to have come true. He was highly sought after and was even invited to the court of  , then the queen consort of   of France, to create   for her children. Nostradamus’s predictions tended to be about general types of events, like natural disasters and conflict-related events that tend to occur regularly as time goes on. Some people believe that his prophecies have predicted actual events, such as the death of Henry II, the  , the rise of  , the rise of  , and the  . Others maintain that because his prophecies tend to be about general types of events that occur frequently throughout history—and are written in a cryptic and vague manner—it’s possible to find one that seems to match almost any event that has occurred.

Ames received her   (1930) and master’s (1933) degrees in   from the  . Her doctoral degree in   was granted by   in 1936. Working with American psychologist and pediatrician  , Ames examined the   of creeping and crawling in infants (known as “prone progression”) for her doctoral dissertation. This work soon developed into the theme that became her life’s work—the appearance of relatively clear-cut stages of human development that follow each other in a defined and predictable pattern. In 1950 Ames and colleagues cofounded the  Gesell Institute of Child Development in  , Connecticut, to continue and promote Gesell’s work. There Ames served as director of research, as associate director, and later as director. After retirement she was president of the institute’s board. In 1951 Ames and pediatrician  Frances Ilg (Gesell Institute cofounder and researcher) began writing a nationally   newspaper column called “Child Behavior” (changed to “Parents Ask” after 1962), which lasted until 1973. From 1953 to the early 1990s, Ames wrote and cowrote numerous books and articles, and she appeared on several television and radio shows. Some of her best-known books include   (1974),   (1979),   (1982), and   (1985).

URL: https://www.britannica.com/story/is-the-oedipus-complex-real

Content: Born in 1903, four-year-old Herbert Graf witnessed the collapse of a horse who had been pulling a heavy cart. It was a traumatic experience for the boy, who subsequently developed a fear of horses. Additionally, Herbert’s father noted that he developed particular anxieties: Herbert felt uneasy without his mother around, had an intense fixation on male genitalia (especially those on horses), and described dreams of two giraffes—one healthy, another crumpled—in which he takes away the crumpled giraffe while the healthy one calls out to him. Herbert Graf, otherwise known as “Little Hans,” was the focus of psychoanalyst  ’s case study that supported his theory of the  . When the boy’s father described his son’s symptoms, Freud interpreted Herbert to be an example of a child experiencing this phenomenon. Freud described it as an intense attraction felt by young children toward their opposite-sex parents and an intense jealousy and combativeness toward their same-sex caretakers. Contextualized within his larger theory of psychosexual development, Freud argued that children are innately sexual beings who become fixated on different body areas before resolving the Oedipus complex and moving on to have adult romantic relationships—and he believed that Herbert Graf was the boy who could prove this.  The case study of Little Hans, who was among the very few children studied by Freud, became the defining case for Freud’s Oedipus complex. Freud argued that Herbert’s anxieties all stemmed from his foundational animosity toward his father. For instance, Freud claimed that Herbert’s phobia of horses represented a variation of castration anxiety—the fear that a horse, resembling his father, would punish him for desiring his mother by castrating him. Freud interpreted the giraffe dream as a reinvention of a fantasized relationship between Herbert and his parents: Herbert desires to be with the crumpled giraffe, representing his mother, while his father, manifested in the healthy giraffe, calls out from a distance. Though seemingly absurd and farfetched today, especially when used as evidence for a theory, the case of Little Hans was foundational in the legacy of Freud’s influential contributions to  . Freud himself stressed how much importance he placed on his theory,   that the “discovery of the repressed Oedipus complex…alone would give [psychoanalysis] a claim to be included among the precious new acquisitions of mankind.” But despite Freud’s comments, how valid and relevant is the Oedipus complex today? Sigmund Freud has always been a controversial figure. The Oedipus complex, a theory that suggests that every single person has deeply repressed incestuous instincts for their parents since childhood, is no less so. Critics of Freud have noted that, despite the case of Little Hans, there is very little empirical evidence to prove the theory’s validity. While Freud is viewed as a historically significant figure who was extremely influential in his field, his ideas are often regarded by academics and practitioners with less zeal.  Furthermore, modern developments in gender and sexuality studies have opposed many conclusions of Freudian psychoanalysis. For instance, Freud suggested that an incomplete resolution of the Oedipus complex can lead to homosexuality, caused by the child’s eventual identification with their opposite-sex parent instead of their same-sex one. This distinguishes homosexuality as a diversion from “normal” sexual development, and it further suggests sexuality as something that is shaped by traumatic or deviant childhood experiences. This idea differs from the modern consensus that homosexuality is a normal sexual experience. Another persistent critique of the Oedipus complex is its overwhelmingly masculine theme, with Freud’s original theory focusing almost exclusively on the sexual development of boys. When speaking of the female perspective in the Oedipus complex, Freud tended to frame it in masculine terms: for example, he describes girls as suffering from penis envy, a supposed realization that they do not possess a penis, which causes many anxieties that, Freud claimed, originate in girls’ unwelcome realization that they are not men like their fathers. Freud himself   that “psychology…is unable to solve the riddle of femininity,” elaborating on his extremely limited and somewhat problematic psychoanalytic work on (and disinterest in) the psychology of women.  Despite these criticisms, however, there is both empirical and anecdotal evidence that parents do have a significant impact on their children’s sexual tendencies. A   showed that male rats are sexually attracted to females with scents that remind them of their mothers, and a   suggests that people are more attracted to others who look like them and are also more inclined to find others more attractive after seeing a picture of their opposite-sex parent. So while the case of Little Hans, more than a century later, may not escape the intense scrutiny of modern empirical analysis, recent evidence perhaps can prove what Sigmund Freud and Herbert Graf could not.

Content: Cruel and fickle, passionate and vindictive, jealous and insecure, petty and insane: the inhabitants of Mount Olympus represent an attempt by the ancient Greeks to explain the chaos of the universe through human nature. Thus, like every deity invented before and since, these gods and goddesses are embodiments of human solipsism. (Of course lightning is caused by a giant, angry man in the sky…obvi. I mean, what else could it be?) The stories of their battles, bickering, and sexual conquests have indelibly influenced the course of Western language and narrative. Here is a selection of some of the A-list names of the Greek pantheon.  was the goddess of love, sex, and beauty. Unsurprisingly for a love goddess, she was said to have emerged from the foam generated when the severed testicles of her father, Uranus, were thrown into the sea by his son, the Titan Cronus. (Or   that surprising?) Kind of makes Botticelli’s surreally lovely  —which depicts Aphrodite’s   emerging from the waves—a little more visceral, doesn’t it?  was the goddess of reason, wisdom, and war. She famously sprung fully formed from the forehead of Zeus. A major figure in the  , in which she instructed Odysseus, she also guided Perseus and Heracles through their trials. The Parthenon was her chief temple in Athens, which is named in her honor. Her Roman equivalent was  .  was the fleet-footed goddess of the hunt. Often depicted in painting and sculpture with a deer or a hunting dog, she was both huntress and protectress of the living world. Her Roman equivalent was  .  was the god of bloodlust. (His half-sister Athena represented the more "noble" aspects of combat and civil conduct during war.) Though his fellow deities weren’t particularly fond of him, the Spartans had no problems, er, donating some prisoners of war to his worship. And sacrificing dogs…yeah, that’s right, Ares liked dead puppies. Jerk. His Roman equivalent was  . The twin brother of Artemis,   was among the most important (read: feared) of the gods. Son of Zeus, he disseminated the will of his divine compatriots through various means, notably oracles. The Oracle at Delphi was his mouthpiece; a 2001 study determined that the oracle was likely hallucinating due to ethylene gas rising from the rocks beneath the temple. , an agricultural goddess, was mother to Persephone, who was abducted by the underworld god Hades to be his bride. While searching for her stolen daughter, she accepted the hospitality of the royal family of Eleusis. The  , perhaps the most important religious rites in ancient Greece, are attributed to her teachings. Her Roman equivalent was  .  was a son of Zeus born to a mortal mother. When Zeus accidentally killed her, he sewed the young Dionysus into his thigh and, when the young god emerged, passed him to the care of the maenads. The cult of Dionysus revolved around intoxication, sex, and savage ritual sacrifice. He was often symbolized by a bull due to his association with the sacrificial animal. Elements of his character are seen in the Roman god of wine, Bacchus.  ruled the world of the dead, with which he was sometimes synonymous. The chilly lord of the underworld was among the few Greek gods to come across as dispassionate. He was not the ultimate judge of the souls that wandered his domain nor did he mete out their punishments for sins committed during their mortal lives. He was, however, cunning; he tricked Persephone into eating enchanted pomegranate seeds so that she would have to remain with him for a portion of the year. The queen goddess of Olympus,   was both sister and wife to Zeus. Though she is often depicted as reserved and austere, she was mercilessly vindictive when it came to her husband’s [many] extramarital adventures. Unfortunately for the objects of Zeus’s godly affections, Hera tended to torment the "other women" (and their offspring, including Heracles) rather than Zeus himself. Her Roman equivalent was  . Like many gods in the Greek pantheon,   presided over multiple spheres. He was a pastoral figure, responsible for protecting livestock, and was also associated with fertility, music, luck, and deception. In the  , he is depicted as a messenger god. His Roman equivalent was  .  is best known as the Greek sea god, but he was also the god of horses and of earthquakes. (Thus, many of his temples were inland.) And he had some seriously strange children. Though humanoid, he fathered both the winged horse Pegasus (by Medusa, no less) and the Cyclops Polyphemus, who is blinded by Odysseus and his crew in the  . His Roman equivalent was  . With the assistance of Hades and Poseidon,   overthrew his father, Cronus, king of the Titans, and became the chief deity in a new pantheon comprising mostly his siblings and children. In addition to controlling the weather, Zeus was noted for his chronic infidelity to his sister-wife, Hera. Among the results of his weakness for comely mortal women was Helen of Troy. His Roman equivalent was  .

It was a traumatic experience for the boy, who subsequently developed a fear of horses. Additionally, Herbert’s father noted that he developed particular anxieties: Herbert felt uneasy without his mother around, had an intense fixation on male genitalia (especially those on horses), and described dreams of two giraffes—one healthy, another crumpled—in which he takes away the crumpled giraffe while the healthy one calls out to him. Herbert Graf, otherwise known as “Little Hans,” was the focus of psychoanalyst  ’s case study that supported his theory of the  . When the boy’s father described his son’s symptoms, Freud interpreted Herbert to be an example of a child experiencing this phenomenon. Freud described it as an intense attraction felt by young children toward their opposite-sex parents and an intense jealousy and combativeness toward their same-sex caretakers. Contextualized within his larger theory of psychosexual development, Freud argued that children are innately sexual beings who become fixated on different body areas before resolving the Oedipus complex and moving on to have adult romantic relationships—and he believed that Herbert Graf was the boy who could prove this.  The case study of Little Hans, who was among the very few children studied by Freud, became the defining case for Freud’s Oedipus complex. Freud argued that Herbert’s anxieties all stemmed from his foundational animosity toward his father. For instance, Freud claimed that Herbert’s phobia of horses represented a variation of castration anxiety—the fear that a horse, resembling his father, would punish him for desiring his mother by castrating him. Freud interpreted the giraffe dream as a reinvention of a fantasized relationship between Herbert and his parents: Herbert desires to be with the crumpled giraffe, representing his mother, while his father, manifested in the healthy giraffe, calls out from a distance. Though seemingly absurd and farfetched today, especially when used as evidence for a theory, the case of Little Hans was foundational in the legacy of Freud’s influential contributions to  . Freud himself stressed how much importance he placed on his theory,   that the “discovery of the repressed Oedipus complex…alone would give [psychoanalysis] a claim to be included among the precious new acquisitions of mankind.” But despite Freud’s comments, how valid and relevant is the Oedipus complex today? Sigmund Freud has always been a controversial figure. The Oedipus complex, a theory that suggests that every single person has deeply repressed incestuous instincts for their parents since childhood, is no less so. Critics of Freud have noted that, despite the case of Little Hans, there is very little empirical evidence to prove the theory’s validity. While Freud is viewed as a historically significant figure who was extremely influential in his field, his ideas are often regarded by academics and practitioners with less zeal.  Furthermore, modern developments in gender and sexuality studies have opposed many conclusions of Freudian psychoanalysis. For instance, Freud suggested that an incomplete resolution of the Oedipus complex can lead to homosexuality, caused by the child’s eventual identification with their opposite-sex parent instead of their same-sex one. This distinguishes homosexuality as a diversion from “normal” sexual development, and it further suggests sexuality as something that is shaped by traumatic or deviant childhood experiences. This idea differs from the modern consensus that homosexuality is a normal sexual experience. Another persistent critique of the Oedipus complex is its overwhelmingly masculine theme, with Freud’s original theory focusing almost exclusively on the sexual development of boys. When speaking of the female perspective in the Oedipus complex, Freud tended to frame it in masculine terms: for example, he describes girls as suffering from penis envy, a supposed realization that they do not possess a penis, which causes many anxieties that, Freud claimed, originate in girls’ unwelcome realization that they are not men like their fathers. Freud himself   that “psychology…is unable to solve the riddle of femininity,” elaborating on his extremely limited and somewhat problematic psychoanalytic work on (and disinterest in) the psychology of women.  Despite these criticisms, however, there is both empirical and anecdotal evidence that parents do have a significant impact on their children’s sexual tendencies. A   showed that male rats are sexually attracted to females with scents that remind them of their mothers, and a   suggests that people are more attracted to others who look like them and are also more inclined to find others more attractive after seeing a picture of their opposite-sex parent. So while the case of Little Hans, more than a century later, may not escape the intense scrutiny of modern empirical analysis, recent evidence perhaps can prove what Sigmund Freud and Herbert Graf could not.

Content: Traditionally favored by private and parochial institutions,   are being adopted by US public schools in increasing numbers. According to a 2020 report, the percentage of public schools that required school uniforms jumped from 12% in the 1999-2000 school year to 20% in the 2017-18 school year. School uniforms were most frequently required by elementary schools (23%), followed by middle (18%), and high schools (10%). The first recorded use of   in education may have been in England in 1222, when the Archbishop of Canterbury mandated that students wear a robe-like outfit called the “cappa clausa.” The origin of the modern school uniform can be traced to 16th Century England, when the impoverished “charity children” attending the Christ’s Hospital boarding school wore blue cloaks reminiscent of the cassocks worn by clergy, along with yellow stockings. As of Sep. 2014, students at Christ’s Hospital were still wearing the same uniform, and according to the school it is the oldest school uniform still in use. When Christ’s Hospital surveyed its students in 2011, 95% voted to keep the traditional uniforms. School uniforms in the United States followed the traditional use of uniforms established in England and were generally limited to private and parochial schools. One exception was found in government-run boarding schools for   children, first established in the late 1800s, where the children, who had been removed from their families, were dressed in military-style uniforms. According to figures released in 2018 by the National Center for Education Statistics, the total number of public schools nationwide requiring students to wear school uniforms increased from 12% during the 1999-2000 school year to 21% during the 2015-2016 school year. In 2015-2016, 25% of public primary schools enforced a uniform policy, as did 20% of public middle schools and 12% of public high schools. A higher proportion of schools located in cities had mandatory uniforms in 2015-2016 than schools in suburban, town, and rural areas. Mandatory   were far more prevalent in “high-poverty” schools (in which 76% of students were eligible for reduced-cost or free lunch programs) than in “low-poverty” schools. Among the US cities with the highest use of   in public schools are Philadelphia (100% of schools), New Orleans (95%), Cleveland (85%), Chicago (80%), Boston (65%), and Miami (60%). The number of schools with “strict dress codes” has also increased, from 47% in 2000 to 57% in 2010.

Content: The   came to national prominence in the United States during the mid-1950s and continued to challenge racial segregation and discrimination through the 1960s. Many organizations, notably the  , headed by  , the  , and the  , arranged nonviolent demonstrations to call attention to specific inequalities experienced by Black people, while individuals also challenged unjust laws independently. The civil rights movement eventually achieved equal rights legislation, but not without challenges. In the late 1960s complications arose as various groups confronted the enduring economic and social consequences of past oppression. These problems persisted in subsequent decades, and the idea of real equality remained elusive well into the 21st century. Nonetheless, the intrepid supporters of the civil rights movement took some of the hardest first steps toward equality. On May 17, 1954, the   ruled in the case   that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. The decision effectively overturned the “separate but equal” ruling of   (1896), which had allowed   that mandated separate public facilities for white and Black Americans to prevail throughout the South during the first half of the 20th century. While the   ruling applied only to schools, it implied that segregation in other public facilities was unconstitutional as well. On December 1, 1955, African American civil rights activist   refused to give up her seat on a public bus to a white passenger. Her subsequent arrest initiated a sustained bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. The protest began on December 5, led by  , then a young local pastor, and was so successful that it was extended indefinitely. In the ensuing months, protestors faced threats, arrests, and termination from their jobs. Nonetheless, the boycott continued for more than a year. Finally, the   upheld a lower court’s ruling that segregated seating was unconstitutional, and the federal decision went into effect on December 20, 1956. In September 1957 nine African American students attended their first day at Little Rock Central High School, whose entire student population had until that point been white. The  , as they came to be called, encountered a large white mob and soldiers from the Arkansas National Guard, sent by Arkansas Gov.  , blocking the entrance of the school. For the next 18 days Pres.  , Gov. Faubus, and Little Rock’s mayor, Woodrow Mann, discussed the situation. The Little Rock Nine returned on September 23, but were met with violence. The students were sent home and returned on September 25, protected by U.S. soldiers. Although the students were continually harassed, eight of the nine completed the academic year. The entire confrontation drew international attention not only to civil rights in the United States but also to the struggle between federal and state power. On February 1, 1960, a group of four African American students from the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina (now North Carolina A&T State University), a historically Black college, began a sit-in movement in downtown Greensboro. After making purchases at the F.W. Woolworth department store, they sat at the “whites only” lunch counter. They were refused service and eventually asked to leave. The  , as they came to be called, however, remained seated until closing and returned the next day with about 20 other Black students. The sit-in grew in the following weeks with protestors taking every seat in the establishment and spilling out of the store. As protestors were arrested, others would take their places so that the establishment was unceasingly occupied. The protest spread to other cities, including Atlanta and Nashville. After months of protests, facilities began to desegregate throughout the country, and the Greensboro Woolworth’s started to serve African American patrons in July. On November 14, 1960, six-year-old   was escorted to her first day at the previously all-white William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans by four armed federal marshals. They were met with angry mobs shouting their disapproval, and, throughout the day, parents marched in to remove their children from the school as a protest to desegregation. Every subsequent day of that academic year Bridges was escorted to school, enduring insults and threats on her way, and then learning her lessons from her young teacher, Barbara Henry, in an otherwise empty classroom. Her bravery later inspired the Norman Rockwell painting   (1964). The   began on May 4, 1961, with a group of seven African Americans and six white people who boarded two buses bound for New Orleans. Testing the  ’s ruling on the case   v.   (1960), which extended an earlier ruling banning segregated interstate bus travel (1946) to include bus terminals and restrooms, the Freedom Riders used facilities for the opposite race as their buses made stops along the way. The group was confronted by violence in South Carolina, and, on May 14, when one bus stopped to change a slashed tire, the vehicle was firebombed and the Freedom Riders were beaten. Unable to travel farther, the original riders were replaced by a second group of 10, partly organized by the  , originating in Nashville. As riders were either arrested or beaten, more groups of Freedom Riders would take their place. On May 29 U.S. Attorney General   ordered the   to enforce bans on segregation more strictly, an edict that took effect in September. In the spring of 1963,  , and the   launched a campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, with local Pastor   and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) to undermine the city’s system of racial segregation. The campaign began on April 3, 1963, with  , economic boycotts, mass protests, and marches on City Hall. The demonstrations faced challenges from many sides, including an indifferent African American community, adversarial white and Black leaders, and a hostile commissioner of public safety, Eugene (“Bull”) Connor. On April 12 King was arrested for violating an anti-protest injunction and placed in solitary confinement. The demonstrations continued, but, after a month without any concessions, King was convinced to launch the Children’s Crusade. Beginning on May 2, 1963, school-aged volunteers skipped school and began to march. Many submitted politely to arrests, and local jails quickly filled up. On May 3 Connor ordered the police and fire department to set high-pressure water hoses and attack dogs on protesters. The violent tactics against peaceful demonstrators continued in ensuing days, causing outrage in the community, and gaining national attention. The negative media spurred Pres.   to propose a civil rights bill on June 11. Although the Birmingham campaign eventually negotiated an agreement with local reforms, tensions remained high in the city, and the meeting places of civil rights activists were continually threatened. A bomb on September 15 at   killed four African American girls and injured 14 others. The demonstrations of 1963 culminated with the   for Jobs and Freedom on August 28 to protest civil rights abuses and employment discrimination. A crowd of about 250,000 individuals gathered peacefully on the   in Washington, D.C., to listen to speeches by civil rights leaders, notably  . He addressed the crowd with an eloquent and uplifting message that famously became known as the “ ” speech. On July 2, 1964, Pres.  , signed the   into law, a stronger version of what his predecessor, President  , had proposed the previous summer before his   in November 1963. The act authorized the federal government to prevent racial discrimination in employment, voting, and the use of public facilities. Although controversial, the legislation was a victory for the civil rights movement. On February 21, 1965, the prominent Black leader   was assassinated while lecturing at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem, New York. An eloquent orator, Malcolm X spoke out on the civil rights movement, demanding it move beyond civil rights to human rights, and argued that the solution to racial problems was in orthodox Islam. His speeches and ideas contributed to the development of   ideology and the  . On March 7, 1965,  , organized a march from Selma, Alabama, to the state’s capital, Montgomery, to call for a federal voting rights law that would provide legal support for disenfranchised African Americans in the South. State troopers, however, sent marchers back with violence and tear gas, and television cameras recorded the incident. On March 9 King tried again, leading more than 2,000 marchers to the Pettus Bridge, where they encountered a barricade of state troopers. King led his followers to kneel in prayer and then he unexpectedly turned back. The media attention prompted President   to introduce voting rights legislation on March 15, and on March 21  ; this time, they were protected by Alabama National Guardsmen, federal marshals, and FBI agents. Marchers arrived in Montgomery on March 25, where King addressed the crowd with what would be called his “How Long, Not Long” speech. The   was signed into law several months later, on August 6. It suspended literacy tests, provided for federal approval of proposed changes to voting laws or procedures, and directed the attorney general of the United States to challenge the use of poll taxes for state and local elections. A series of violent confrontations between the city police and residents of Watts and other predominantly African American neighborhoods of Los Angeles began on August 11, 1965, after a white police officer arrested a Black man, Marquette Frye, on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Later accounts indicated that Frye resisted arrest but were unclear whether police had used excessive force. Violence, fires, and looting broke out over the next six days. The   resulted in 34 deaths, more than 1,000 injuries, and $40 million in property damage. The McCone Commission later investigated the causes of the riots and concluded that they were not the work of gangs or the Black Muslim movement, as the media had previously suggested. The violence was more directly a reaction to the great economic challenges that African Americans in urban centers faced: poor housing, schools, and job prospects that civil rights legislation had not improved. In the wake of the assassination of   and urban uprisings,   and   founded the   in Oakland, California, to protect African American neighborhoods from  . The   launched numerous community programs that offered such services as tuberculosis testing, legal aid, transportation assistance, and free shoes to disadvantaged people. The programs confronted the economic problems of African Americans, which the party argued the civil rights reforms did not do enough to address. The Black Panthers’ socialist viewpoint, however, made them a target of the  ’s counterintelligence program ( ), which accused them of being a communist organization and an enemy of the U.S. government. A campaign to annihilate the group came to a head in December 1969 with a police shoot-out at the group’s Southern California headquarters and the killing of   and another Panther during an Illinois state police raid. The Black Panther Party’s operations, however, continued into the 1970s, albeit less actively. On June 12, 1967, the   declared the Virginia statutes prohibiting interracial marriage unconstitutional in the case  . The case was decided nine years after Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Jeter, a woman of mixed African American and Native American ancestry, had pleaded guilty to having violated Virginia state law prohibiting a white person and a “colored” person from leaving the state to be married and returning to live as man and wife. Their one-year prison sentence was suspended on the condition that the couple leave Virginia and not return as husband and wife for 25 years. Once settled in Washington, D.C., the couple filed suit in a Virginia state court in 1963. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which reversed their conviction. Chief Justice   wrote for a unanimous court that the freedom to marry was a basic civil right and that to deny that freedom based on the groundless classifications outlined in Virginia state’s law was “to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law.” The ruling thus invalidated laws against interracial marriage in Virginia and 15 other states. A series of violent confrontations between residents of predominantly Black neighborhoods and city police in Detroit began on July 23, 1967, after a raid at an illegal drinking club where police arrested everyone inside, including 82 African Americans. Nearby residents protested, and some began to vandalize property, loot businesses, and start fires for the next five days. The   spread to other parts of the city and resulted in 43 deaths, hundreds of injuries, more than 7,000 arrests, and 1,000 burned buildings. As the disturbances continued, President   appointed a   (the Kerner Commission) to investigate recent urban uprisings. It concluded that racism, discrimination, and poverty were some of the causes of the violence and warned that “our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.” On April 4, 1968,   by a sniper while standing on the second-floor balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He had been staying at the hotel after leading a nonviolent demonstration in support of striking sanitation workers in that city. His murder set off riots in hundreds of cities across the country, and it also pushed   to pass the stalled   in King’s honor on April 11. The legislation made it unlawful for sellers, landlords, and financial institutions to refuse to rent, sell, or provide financing for a dwelling based on factors other than an individual’s financial resources. After that victory, some of King’s supporters carried on his activities, including staging the Poor People’s March in Washington, D.C., that spring. The civil rights movement, however, seemed to be shifting away from the nonviolent tactics and interracial cooperation that had brought about a number of policy changes. The changes, however, could not overcome deep-seated discrimination and the economic oppression that prevented real equality.

Content: Vaquitas, the rarest and smallest of all   (members of a certain order of aquatic mammals), inhabit only the waters in Mexico’s Gulf of California. There were nearly 600 vaquitas in 1997, but estimates of how many survive as of 2022 range from just 10 to 18 of the  . The vaquita’s natural range is rich in fish and shrimp, and therefore it is also rich in fishing boats. The gill nets used by the locals are meant to capture the totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder can fetch $20,000 each in China, where it’s viewed as a delicacy. The average vaquita is 4.9 feet long, which makes it similar in size to the totoaba. This is problematic because vaquitas can become entangled in these nets and drown. Gill nets were banned by the Mexican government in 2015 but are still used illegally, despite social programs and restrictions intended to deter their use. William Blake’s “forests of the night,” the stalking grounds of the six subspecies of  , are burning bright. Slash-and-burn agriculture along with logging and human encroachment have hugely diminished the habitat available to these felines, which require extensive ranges capable of supporting the large herbivores that constitute the bulk of their diet. Poaching—for trophies and body parts used in Asian “medicine”—is thought to pose the greatest threat to tigers. An estimated 4,500 tigers are left in the wild. In 2014 China explicitly outlawed the consumption of endangered species, including tigers, whose bones, penises, and other organs are superstitiously believed to have magical curative powers. In 1938, the first year a population survey was conducted, only 29   remained in the wild. Three years later only 16 were left. Hunting and reduction of their wetland habitat had decimated the population, and concerted efforts to salvage remnant birds did not begin until the late 1960s. In 2022 it was estimated that there were more than 500 birds, thanks in large part to innovative breeding programs. Though a plan that involved transferring whooping crane eggs to the nests of related sandhill cranes for fostering ultimately failed, captive rearing and reintroduction have established two wild populations in Florida, one of which has been taught to migrate to Wisconsin. Neither is self-sustaining. The only self-sustaining population migrates between Alberta, Canada, and Texas, U.S. Fewer than 25,000  , the largest animals on the planet, survive today. Comprising several subspecies, blue whales are found in all of the world’s oceans save the Arctic. The current population is thought to have been reduced by up to 90 percent by whaling in the 20th century. Commercial hunting of the species was ultimately banned in 1966. The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service spelled out a recovery plan in 1998. It stipulated the maintenance of photo databases of individual specimens and the collection of genetic and migration data in order to better understand the species, which remains at risk from ship collisions and entanglement in fishing nets. The   estimates that the current population of Asian  , which inhabit 13 countries, is about 40,000–50,000. That number may be far lower; some regions inhabited by the lumbering pachyderms are inaccessible because of the terrain or political volatility. Over 50 percent of the population is concentrated in India. The burgeoning human population there—and elsewhere in Asia—creates conflicts for space and resources. And, while the tusks of Asian elephants are much smaller than those of their African counterparts, the Asian species is still poached for its ivory, meat, and skin. The luxurious waterproof coat that insulates   from the chilly waters they inhabit almost led to their extinction. A target of the commercial fur trade, the species was almost wiped out, its population reduced from an estimated 300,000 in the early 1700s to some 2,000 by 1911. That year an international ban on commercial hunting was enacted. That ban and management and conservation measures taken in the wake of the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act have helped populations recover to perhaps 128,000 worldwide by the early 21st century. Still, sea otters are highly vulnerable to both natural phenomena such as killer whale predation and to anthropogenic factors such as oil spills. At first glance, the  ’s fleshy folds of skin appear to be plated armor, complementing the keratinous horn adorning the skull of this lumbering species. Its population faces many threats: natural disasters, habitat loss, disease, and, notably, poaching for its horn. In 2010 the last of continental Asia’s Javan rhinoceroses was killed in Vietnam. Today the Javan rhinoceros inhabits Ujung Kulon National Park, which sits on a remote peninsula on the eastern side of the Indonesian island of Java. Historically, the single-horned beasts were found across wide swaths of South Asia and Southeast Asia too. The   is nearly extinct, and the Javan rhino, whose population numbers no more than 75 individuals of all ages, appears to be treading a similar path. Depending on whom you ask, there are either two species of  , the eastern ( ) and western ( ), or three subspecies, the eastern lowland, western lowland, and mountain gorillas. Regardless of whom you ask, all gorillas are endangered. There could be more than 300,000 gorillas left in the wild, and they’re listed as critically endangered. Habitat encroachment and poaching for bushmeat, trophies, and supposed magical talismans have led to substantial losses. Because their social structure is so complex and because they reproduce slowly—females giving birth only once every four years at best—the removal of even a few individuals from a gorilla troop can catastrophically impact its ability to sustain itself. Between 1996 and 2008 the population of   dropped some 60 percent because of a contagious cancer known as devil facial tumor disease. It continues to decimate populations of the species, which occurs only on the Australian island of Tasmania. There may be only 10,000 wild individuals remaining. Captive breeding of uninfected individuals has been instituted, and efforts have been made to develop a vaccine for the cancer, which is thought to have stemmed from mutated cells from a single specimen. Orangutan is Malaysian for “person of the forest.” Though morphologically   may resemble melted Muppets more than people, their sophisticated cognitive abilities are very human indeed. Like gorillas and chimpanzees, they have been known to use tools. Threatened largely by logging and capture for the exotic pet trade, orangutans—restricted to the Southeast Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra—number about 120,000 per the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. A 2011 survey revealed that more than 50 percent of the original Bornean orangutan population had been killed in the previous 40 years. Unlike other great apes, orangutans are usually solitary or live in groups of fewer than three, making them difficult to track and study.

In the 1840s the occurrence of hallucinations under a wide variety of conditions (including psychological and physical stress) as well as their genesis through the effects of such drugs as stramonium and   had been described. French physician  Alexandre-Jacques-François Brierre de Boismont in 1845 described many instances of hallucinations associated with intense concentration, or with musing, or simply occurring in the course of  . In the last half of the 19th century, studies of   continued. Investigators in France were particularly oriented toward abnormal psychological function, and from this came descriptions of hallucinosis during   and related reactions. In the 1880s English neurologist   described hallucination as being released or triggered by the  . Other definitions of the term emerged later. Swiss psychiatrist   (1857–1939) defined hallucinations as “perceptions without corresponding stimuli from without,” while the   in 1940 referred to hallucination as the “apparent perception of an external object when no such object is present.” A spirited interest in hallucinations continued well into the 20th century.  ’s concepts of conscious and unconscious activities added new significance to the content of dreams and hallucinations. It was theorized that   normally hallucinate the objects and processes that give them gratification. Although the notion has since been disputed, this “regression”   (i.e., that hallucinating is a regression, or return, to infantile ways) is still employed, especially by those who find it clinically useful. During the same period, others put forth theories that were more broadly biological than Freud’s but that had more points in common with Freud than with each other. The general theory of hallucinations here   rests upon two fundamental assumptions. One assumption states that life experiences influence the   in such a way as to leave, in the brain, enduring physical changes that have variously been called  ,  , or  . Ideas and images are held to derive from the incorporation and activation of these engrams in complex circuits involving nerve cells. Such circuits in the  cortex (outer layers) of the brain appear to subserve the neurophysiology of  ,  , imagination, and  . The emotions associated with these   and perceptual functions seem to be mediated through cortex connections with the deeper parts of the brain (the   or “visceral brain,” for example), thus permitting a   interplay between   and   through transactions that appear to take place largely at unconscious levels.  is found to be mediated by the     reticular activating system (a network of nerve cells in the  ). Analyses of hallucinations reported by sufferers of neurological disorders and by neurosurgical patients in whom the brain is stimulated electrically have shown the importance of the temporal lobes (at the sides of the brain) to auditory hallucinations, for example, and of other functionally relevant parts of the brain in this process. A second assumption states that the total human   is best understood in terms of the constant interplay of forces that continually emanate from inside (as internal physiological activity) and from outside the individual (as sensory stimuli). Such transactions between the   and the individual may be said to exert an   and organizing influence upon memory traces stored in the nervous system and to affect the patterns in which sensory engrams are activated to produce experiences called images, fantasies, dreams, or hallucinations, as well as the emotions associated with these patterns. If such a constantly shifting balance exists between internal and external environmental forces, physiological considerations (e.g., brain function) as well as cultural and experiential factors emerge as major determinants of the content and meaning of hallucinations. The brain is bombarded constantly by sensory impulses, but most of these are   from   in a dynamically shifting, selective fashion. The exclusion seems to be accomplished through the exercise of integrative inner mechanisms that focus one’s awareness on selected parts of potential experience. (The   of a ticking clock, for example, fades in and out of awareness.) Functioning simultaneously, these mechanisms survey information that is stored within the brain, select tiny samples needed to give adaptive significance to the incoming flow of information, and bring forth only a few items for actual recall from the brain’s extensive “memory banks.”

Content:  is one of the most well-known—and reviled—figures in history. As the leader of  , he orchestrated both   and the  , events that led to the deaths of at least 40,000,000 people. In the ensuing decades, he was the subject of countless books, documentaries, and TV shows. This list presents some notable, and a few lesser-known, facts about him.  Adolf Hitler was almost Adolf Schicklgruber. Or Adolf Hiedler. His father, Alois, was born out of wedlock to Maria Anna Schicklgruber and given her surname. However, when he was about 40 years old, Alois decided to adopt the last name of his stepfather, Johann Georg Hiedler, who some speculated was actually his biological father. On the legal documents,   was given as the new last name, though the reason for the spelling change is unknown. Alois Hitler was married twice and had several children before taking Klara Pölzl as his third wife. The couple had six children, though only Adolf and a sister reached adulthood. Adolf had a difficult relationship with his father, who died in 1903, but he adored his mother and was reportedly grief-stricken by her death from breast cancer in 1907.  When he committed suicide in 1945, Hitler was wearing the   First Class medal, earned for his service in  . The honor was especially important to Hitler, who had portrayed himself as a hero during the conflict. Although he was wounded during the   (1916), recent research challenges Hitler’s account of his war experience. Some believe that he saw little if any front-line action and instead was a runner at the relatively safe regiment headquarters. This would counter his claims that he was in danger “probably every day.” In addition, while he stated that he was temporarily blinded during a mustard-gas attack in 1918, purported medical documents state that he suffered from “hysterical blindness.” He was recuperating when Germany surrendered. Oddly, his citation for the Iron Cross First Class fails to mention a specific incident of bravery, leading some researchers to speculate that it was given to honor Hitler’s length of service and his general likability with officers, notably Hugo Gutmann, a Jewish lieutenant who recommended that Hitler receive the award.  In 1924, while in prison for high treason, Hitler began writing what would later be considered one of the world’s most dangerous books. In   (“My Struggle”), which was initially published in two volumes (1925, 1927), Hitler chronicled his life and presented his racist ideology; he claimed to have become “a fanatical  ” while living in Vienna. Although it initially had only limited success,  ’s popularity grew as did that of Hitler and the  . A bible of  , it was required reading in Germany, and by 1939 more than five million copies had been sold. After Hitler’s death, the work was banned in Germany and other countries, and the German state of  , which held the copyright, refused to grant publishing rights. However, some foreign publishers continued to print the work, and in 2016 it entered the public domain after the copyright expired. Days later a heavily annotated   was published in Germany for the first time since 1945. It became a best seller.  Following a series of maneuverings and intrigues, Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany in January 1933. However, he aspired to even greater power, and that was achieved when Germany’s parliamentary building caught fire and was severely damaged on February 27, 1933. While Hitler’s involvement in the   remains uncertain—a lone communist was later convicted of the crime—he used the event to solidify his authority. The day after the blaze, he oversaw the suspension of all civil liberties, and in the following month’s election, the Nazis and their allies secured a majority in the Reichstag. On March 23, 1933, the Reichstag passed the  , which sanctioned Hitler’s dictatorship. Then, in August 1934, shortly after the death of Pres.  , the German people voted to give Hitler complete authority, combining the offices of chancellor and president to create the post of “  und Reichskanzler” (“Leader and Chancellor”).  While much has been made of Hitler’s failed career as an artist—he was rejected by the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts and lived in poverty trying to sell his work—his interest in art seemed only to increase after he became führer. While Hitler favored the idealized work of Classical Greece and Rome, he was highly critical of contemporary movements such as  ,  , and  . In the 1930s Nazis began removing such “ ” from German museums. Modern works by  ,  ,  , and   were later shown in a 1937 multicity exhibition and described as “culture documents of the decadent work of Bolsheviks and Jews.” Throughout the war, Hitler ordered the systematic looting of artworks on an unprecedented scale; reportedly his most coveted stolen item was the  . This and other works were intended to fill a planned “super museum” in Linz, Austria, known as the Führermuseum.  In attempting to build a master “ ” race, the Nazis were known for promoting health-conscious policies. So, it is perhaps not surprising that Hitler was reportedly a teetotaler, nonsmoker, and vegetarian. However, his healthy habits were undermined by his alleged use of opiates. According to recent research, in 1941 his personal physician, Theodor Morell, began injecting him with various drugs, including  ,  ,  , and even  . In fact, drug use was reportedly prevalent throughout the Nazi Party, and soldiers were often given meth before battle. Near the end of his life, Hitler was prone to shaking, and, while some have attributed this to  , others have speculated it was withdrawal from drugs, which by then were hard to obtain.  Perhaps spurred by his earlier poverty, Hitler seemed determined to amass a personal fortune. Much of his money came from predictable sources—siphoning off government money and accepting “donations” from corporations. However, he also undertook more creative schemes. After becoming chancellor, he notably ordered the government to buy copies of his   to give as state wedding gifts to newlyweds, leading to hefty royalties for Hitler. In addition, he refused to pay income tax. He used his vast wealth—which some estimated was about $5 billion—to amass an extensive art collection, purchase fine furnishings, and acquire various properties. After the war, his estate was given to Bavaria.  In 1939 a Swedish legislator nominated Hitler for the  . Although he intended it as a joke, few found it amusing. Instead, it created an uproar, and the nomination was quickly withdrawn. Not that Hitler would have wanted—or even been able to accept—the award. In 1936 German journalist  , a vocal critic of Hitler, had been named the winner of the 1935 peace prize. The gesture was seen as a censure of Nazism and an “insult” to Germany. As a result, Hitler barred all Germans from accepting a   and created the German National Prize for Art and Science as an alternative. The three Germans who subsequently won Nobels during the Third Reich were forced to decline their awards, though they later received the diplomas and medals.  On April 30, 1945, with the war lost and Soviet troops advancing, Hitler committed suicide in his underground bunker in Berlin, shooting himself.  , whom he had recently married, also took her own life. According to Hitler’s wishes, their bodies were burned and then buried. At least, that is the widely accepted version of his death. Almost immediately conspiracy theories began—thanks in part to the Soviets. They initially claimed that they were unable to confirm that Hitler was dead and later spread rumors that he was alive and being protected by the West. When pressed by U.S. Pres.  , Soviet leader   stated that he did not know Hitler’s fate. According to later reports, however, the Soviets recovered his burnt remains, which were identified through dental records. The body was secretly buried before being exhumed and cremated, the ashes being scattered in 1970, though a piece of skull—bearing a single gunshot wound and not found until 1946—was kept. Such news failed to stem the doubts, however, and they only increased in 2009, when researchers determined that the skull fragment actually belonged to a woman.

One primary element clearly is that of a succession of events, but distinguishable events are separated by more or less lengthy intervals that are called durations. Thus, sequence and duration are fundamental aspects of what is perceived in change. Manifestly, duration is relative to the events people isolate in the sequences through which they live: the duration of a kiss, of a meal, of a trip. A given interval always can be subdivided into a sequential chain delimiting briefer durations, as with the regular units that provide   measures of time: the second, the  , the  . Indeed, human experience is not simply that of one single series of events, but of a plurality of overlapping changes. The duration of a radio program, for example, can combine with that of a breakfast, both being inserted within the longer period of an ocean voyage. Humans seem to be unable to live without some concept of time. Ancient philosophies sought to relate the concept of time to some objective reality to which it would correspond.   (1596–1650) inaugurated a critical   of philosophy by stressing the ancient problem of the origin of ideas, including the   of time.   (1724–1804), providing a radical answer to the epistemological problem of time, wrote that we do not appreciate time objectively as a physical thing; that it is simply a pure form of sensible  . Other philosophers of the 18th and 19th centuries sought to explain the notion of time as arising from association and memory of successive perceptions. A move to empirical   emerged with the growth of research on the introspective data of experience. From about mid-19th century, under the influence of the psychophysical notions of  , psychologists conducted experiments to study the relationship between time as perceived and time as measured in  . Their work with adults gradually spread to the study of children and of animals. The psychologists then broadened their investigations of time to cover all forms of   to sequence and duration. One may respond to   in an immediate way (as in unconditioned reflex action) without taking the element of time into account. Stimulation, however, can also signal an event to follow; then it has meaning only as part of the sequence of which it is the first term: bell announcing dinner, a road sign, or an approaching danger. People react to such stimuli with anticipatory   that is adapted to a stimulus or action that has not yet occurred. The principles that govern such time-binding adaptation are none other than those of  . One event becomes conditioned as the signal for another   that is to be sought or avoided. The bottle-fed infant who initially reacts to the nipple on his lips with a simple sucking reflex is gradually conditioned to stop crying when he sees the bottle (the signal for feeding). Later he may learn to react to even more secondary signals that announce the arrival of the bottle;   being lifted from the crib or hearing the sounds of his mother warming the milk in the kitchen. His behaviour has come to incorporate the temporal dimension of the events. According to the principles of  , one stimulus becomes the signal for an ensuing event only if the second stimulus   an adaptive reaction (consummatory or aversive) and only if the order of the sequence is repeated. Conditioning tends to be established most rapidly when the interval between the signal (conditioned stimulus) and the unconditioned stimulus is quite brief.   estimated that the optimum interval for such a sequence was 0.5 second, which corresponds approximately to the intervals characteristic of sequences that are most accurately discriminable perceptually (see below  ). Aside from adapting the individual to the order of a sequence, conditioning also adapts to the duration between signal and immediately effective stimulus. Response to signal tends to occur after about the same interval that separated the two stimuli during conditioning. Thus, an animal may be trained to delay a response for some time after the signal (delayed conditioning). This form of adaptation is most   in  , permitting people to anticipate sequences of events in their   so that they can prepare to cope appropriately with what is yet to happen. In 1912 one of Pavlov’s students (I.P. Feokritova) demonstrated that a dog accustomed to being fed every 30 minutes would begin to drool toward the end of each half-hour period. It was clear evidence of conditioning to time; the between-feedings interval itself served as a conditioned stimulus. That discovery underscores the ever-present periodicity of daily living, especially on the   level: rhythms of activity and sleep, rhythms of eating and lovemaking. As conditioning intervenes, anticipatory experiences of hunger, fatigue, or arousal serve our adaptation to ecological demands. Allowance should also be made for the daily, or   in metabolic activity (  daily cycles of temperature change). There is evidence that these fundamental biological functions can synchronize with the rhythmic phases of environmental (exogenous) change. Thus within a few days after a factory worker has been assigned to the night shift, highs and lows of his daily fluctuations of temperature will be inversed. The rhythmic changes in body temperature persists, nevertheless, suggesting an innate (endogenous) basis for circadian phenomena. Such a   would mean that the gradual establishment of human circadian rhythms of sleep or temperature results from maturation of the   rather than from conditioning in the strict sense. Experiments begun in 1962, in which men lived in caves or other enclosures for months deprived of temporal cues from the environment, also demonstrated the enduring nature of rhythms in body temperature and in sleep–wakefulness. The rhythmic periods, however, sometimes expanded, the subject beginning to live on an approximately two-day cycle without being aware of it. Through conditioning to time and by way of circadian rhythms, human physiology provides a kind of biological   that offers points of reference for   orientation.

Space perception provides cues, such as depth and distance, that are important for movement and orientation to the  . Human beings have been interested in the   of objects in space at least since antiquity. It was popularly thought in   that objects could be seen because they emitted what was imagined to be a continuous series of extremely thin “membranes” in their own image; these fell upon the eye and merged into the picture that was perceived. Centuries of experimental research led to a more tenable   in which space was described in terms of three   or planes: height (vertical plane), width (horizontal plane), and depth (sagittal plane). These planes all intersect at right angles, and their single axis of intersection is defined as being located within perceived three-dimensional space—that is, in the “eye” of the perceiving individual. Humans do not ordinarily perceive a binocular space (a separate visual world from each eye) but instead see a so-called  , as if the images from each eye fuse to produce a single visual field akin to that of Cyclops, a one-eyed giant in  . The horizontal, vertical, and sagittal planes divide space into various sectors: something is perceived as “above” or “below” (the horizontal plane), as “in front of” or “behind” (the vertical plane), or as “to the right” or “to the left” (of the sagittal plane). An early theory put forth by the Anglican bishop   at the beginning of the 18th century was that the third dimension (depth) cannot be directly perceived by the eyes because the retinal image of any object is two-dimensional, as in a painting. He held that the ability to have visual experiences of depth is not inborn but can result only from logical deduction based on   learning through the use of other senses such as touch. Although modern research fails to verify Berkeley’s emphasis on reason as central to perception, contemporary theories still include both nativistic (inborn) and empirical (learned through experience) considerations. The study of   developed rapidly in the second half of the 19th century and still more rapidly during the 20th. Many psychologists who deal with perceptual function hold that the study of space perception is rapidly becoming a distinct branch of   in its own right. This special field within psychology concentrates on the factors contributing to the perceived organization of objects in space (e.g., on cues to depth perception, movement, form, colour, and their interactions) or dwells on particularly interesting special problems such as that of  amodal perception (e.g., the question of how one perceives that there are six sides to a cube, even though only three of them can be seen at a single time). Space perception research also offers insight into ways that perceptual   helps orient the individual to the environment. Specifically, orientation in space typically seems to reflect one’s strivings (e.g., to seek food or to avoid injury). People could not orient themselves to their  , however, unless the environmental information reaching them through the various sense organs offered a perception of space that corresponds to their physical “reality.” Such perception is called  veridical perception—the direct perception of stimuli as they exist. Without some degree of veridicality concerning physical space, one cannot seek food, flee from enemies, or even socialize. Veridical perception also causes a person to experience changing stimuli as if they were stable: even though the sensory image of an approaching tiger grows larger, for example, one tends to perceive that the animal’s size remains unchanged. In other words, one perceives objects in the environment as having relatively constant   (as to size, colour, and so on) despite considerable variations in stimulus conditions. Not all perception of space, however, is veridical; instead, perception may fail to correspond to reality—often in some systematic way. These are cases of nonveridical perception. Experiments have shown that the three basic spatial planes (horizontal, vertical, and sagittal) dominate the ability of the individual to localize visual objects in nearby space. Often, objects can be perceived as   closer to these basic dimensions or planes than they really are. (Part of the explanation of these perceptual discrepancies in visual experience may lie in the force of  .) Nonveridical perceptions do not generate   in one’s perception of space. Instead, they clarify the perceived characteristics of surrounding space. If all of the mass of sensory information available at a given moment were perceived veridically, the flood of data might confuse the perceiver to the point of disorientation. In other words, some degree of selectivity in perception appears to guide the survival of the individual. Ideally, information about the environment is perceived only as it is relevant to the goals, needs, or physiological state of the individual at a given moment.

After receiving a Ph.D. in psychology at   in 1928, Gibson joined the faculty of  . He married   (née Jack)—who would become a prominent psychologist in her own right—in 1932. During   he served in the Army Air Forces (1942–46), where he did research on visual aircraft identification and on increasing the effectiveness of training films, among other topics. After the war he returned to Smith College before moving to   in 1949. He retired in 1972. Gibson developed what he called an “ecological approach” to the study of visual perception, according to which humans perceive their   directly, without mediation by   processes or by mental entities such as  . Perceiving a tree, for example, does not consist of constructing a mental image of a tree from stimuli (light energy) entering the visual system and then attributing the visual properties of the image to the tree itself. Instead, one directly sees the visual properties of the tree. This idea was radical because it contradicted a centuries-old model of the origins of human knowledge. As Gibson himself put it, “The old idea that sensory inputs are converted into perceptions by operations of the   is rejected.” Gibson created a highly influential theory of “ affordances,” which are qualities of an object or   that communicate opportunities to do certain things (e.g., dark shade indicates an opportunity to get out of the sunshine; a thick cushion signals the availability of comfortable seating). According to Gibson, affordances exist naturally and are directly perceived by the viewer. His work had a large impact in  , or  , which is partly concerned with the perceived affordances in products designed for human use. In addition to   (1979), Gibson’s most important writings include   (1950) and    (1966). His followers organized the International Society for Ecological Psychology in 1981.

By 1838 the significant relationship between the content of   and of hallucinations had been pointed out. In the 1840s the occurrence of hallucinations under a wide variety of conditions (including psychological and physical stress) as well as their genesis through the effects of such drugs as stramonium and   had been described.

In the last half of the 19th century, studies of   continued. Investigators in France were particularly oriented toward abnormal psychological function, and from this came descriptions of hallucinosis during   and related reactions. In the 1880s English neurologist   described hallucination as being released or triggered by the  . Other definitions of the term emerged later. Swiss psychiatrist   (1857–1939) defined hallucinations as “perceptions without corresponding stimuli from without,” while the   in 1940 referred to hallucination as the “apparent perception of an external object when no such object is present.” A spirited interest in hallucinations continued well into the 20th century.  ’s concepts of conscious and unconscious activities added new significance to the content of dreams and hallucinations. It was theorized that   normally hallucinate the objects and processes that give them gratification. Although the notion has since been disputed, this “regression”   (i.e., that hallucinating is a regression, or return, to infantile ways) is still employed, especially by those who find it clinically useful. During the same period, others put forth theories that were more broadly biological than Freud’s but that had more points in common with Freud than with each other. The general theory of hallucinations here   rests upon two fundamental assumptions. One assumption states that life experiences influence the   in such a way as to leave, in the brain, enduring physical changes that have variously been called  ,  , or  . Ideas and images are held to derive from the incorporation and activation of these engrams in complex circuits involving nerve cells. Such circuits in the  cortex (outer layers) of the brain appear to subserve the neurophysiology of  ,  , imagination, and  . The emotions associated with these   and perceptual functions seem to be mediated through cortex connections with the deeper parts of the brain (the   or “visceral brain,” for example), thus permitting a   interplay between   and   through transactions that appear to take place largely at unconscious levels.  is found to be mediated by the     reticular activating system (a network of nerve cells in the  ). Analyses of hallucinations reported by sufferers of neurological disorders and by neurosurgical patients in whom the brain is stimulated electrically have shown the importance of the temporal lobes (at the sides of the brain) to auditory hallucinations, for example, and of other functionally relevant parts of the brain in this process. A second assumption states that the total human   is best understood in terms of the constant interplay of forces that continually emanate from inside (as internal physiological activity) and from outside the individual (as sensory stimuli). Such transactions between the   and the individual may be said to exert an   and organizing influence upon memory traces stored in the nervous system and to affect the patterns in which sensory engrams are activated to produce experiences called images, fantasies, dreams, or hallucinations, as well as the emotions associated with these patterns. If such a constantly shifting balance exists between internal and external environmental forces, physiological considerations (e.g., brain function) as well as cultural and experiential factors emerge as major determinants of the content and meaning of hallucinations. The brain is bombarded constantly by sensory impulses, but most of these are   from   in a dynamically shifting, selective fashion. The exclusion seems to be accomplished through the exercise of integrative inner mechanisms that focus one’s awareness on selected parts of potential experience. (The   of a ticking clock, for example, fades in and out of awareness.) Functioning simultaneously, these mechanisms survey information that is stored within the brain, select tiny samples needed to give adaptive significance to the incoming flow of information, and bring forth only a few items for actual recall from the brain’s extensive “memory banks.”

While a student at  , Land became interested in  ,   light in which all rays are aligned in the same plane. He took a leave of absence, and, after intensive study and experimentation, succeeded (1932) in aligning submicroscopic crystals of iodoquinine sulfate and embedding them in a sheet of plastic. The resulting polarizer, for which he   numerous uses and which he dubbed Polaroid J sheet, was a tremendous advance. It allowed the use of almost any size of polarizer and significantly reduced the cost. With George Wheelwright III, a Harvard   instructor, Land founded the  ,  , in 1932. He developed and, in 1936, began to use numerous types of Polaroid material in sunglasses and other optical devices. Polaroid was later used in camera filters and other optical equipment. Land founded the Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, Mass., in 1937. Four years later he developed a widely used, three-dimensional motion-picture process based on polarized light. During   he applied the polarizing principle to various types of military equipment. Land began work on an instantaneous developing film after the war. In 1947 he demonstrated a camera (known as the  ) that produced a finished print in 60 seconds. The Land photographic process soon found numerous commercial, military, and scientific applications. Many   were made in the following years, including the development of a colour process. Land’s Polaroid Land cameras, which were able to produce developed photographs within one minute after the exposure, became some of the most popular cameras in the world. Land’s interest in light and colour resulted in a new theory of  . In a series of experiments he revealed certain conflicts in the classical theory of colour perception. He found that the colour perceived is not dependent on the relative amounts of blue, green, and red light entering the eye; he proposed that at least three independent image-forming mechanisms, which he called retinexes, are sensitive to different colours and work in   to indicate the colour seen. Land received more than 500 patents for his innovations in light and plastics. In 1980 he retired as   of Polaroid but remained active in the field of light and colour research by working with the  , a nonprofit centre supported by the Rowland Foundation, Inc., a corporation that Land founded in 1960. Under Land’s direction, Rowland researchers discovered that perception of light and colour is regulated essentially by the brain, rather than through a spectrum system in the retina of the eye, as was previously believed.

One primary element clearly is that of a succession of events, but distinguishable events are separated by more or less lengthy intervals that are called durations. Thus, sequence and duration are fundamental aspects of what is perceived in change. Manifestly, duration is relative to the events people isolate in the sequences through which they live: the duration of a kiss, of a meal, of a trip. A given interval always can be subdivided into a sequential chain delimiting briefer durations, as with the regular units that provide   measures of time: the second, the  , the  . Indeed, human experience is not simply that of one single series of events, but of a plurality of overlapping changes. The duration of a radio program, for example, can combine with that of a breakfast, both being inserted within the longer period of an ocean voyage. Humans seem to be unable to live without some concept of time. Ancient philosophies sought to relate the concept of time to some objective reality to which it would correspond.   (1596–1650) inaugurated a critical   of philosophy by stressing the ancient problem of the origin of ideas, including the   of time.   (1724–1804), providing a radical answer to the epistemological problem of time, wrote that we do not appreciate time objectively as a physical thing; that it is simply a pure form of sensible  . Other philosophers of the 18th and 19th centuries sought to explain the notion of time as arising from association and memory of successive perceptions. A move to empirical   emerged with the growth of research on the introspective data of experience. From about mid-19th century, under the influence of the psychophysical notions of  , psychologists conducted experiments to study the relationship between time as perceived and time as measured in  . Their work with adults gradually spread to the study of children and of animals. The psychologists then broadened their investigations of time to cover all forms of   to sequence and duration. One may respond to   in an immediate way (as in unconditioned reflex action) without taking the element of time into account. Stimulation, however, can also signal an event to follow; then it has meaning only as part of the sequence of which it is the first term: bell announcing dinner, a road sign, or an approaching danger. People react to such stimuli with anticipatory   that is adapted to a stimulus or action that has not yet occurred. The principles that govern such time-binding adaptation are none other than those of  . One event becomes conditioned as the signal for another   that is to be sought or avoided. The bottle-fed infant who initially reacts to the nipple on his lips with a simple sucking reflex is gradually conditioned to stop crying when he sees the bottle (the signal for feeding). Later he may learn to react to even more secondary signals that announce the arrival of the bottle;   being lifted from the crib or hearing the sounds of his mother warming the milk in the kitchen. His behaviour has come to incorporate the temporal dimension of the events. According to the principles of  , one stimulus becomes the signal for an ensuing event only if the second stimulus   an adaptive reaction (consummatory or aversive) and only if the order of the sequence is repeated. Conditioning tends to be established most rapidly when the interval between the signal (conditioned stimulus) and the unconditioned stimulus is quite brief.   estimated that the optimum interval for such a sequence was 0.5 second, which corresponds approximately to the intervals characteristic of sequences that are most accurately discriminable perceptually (see below  ). Aside from adapting the individual to the order of a sequence, conditioning also adapts to the duration between signal and immediately effective stimulus. Response to signal tends to occur after about the same interval that separated the two stimuli during conditioning. Thus, an animal may be trained to delay a response for some time after the signal (delayed conditioning). This form of adaptation is most   in  , permitting people to anticipate sequences of events in their   so that they can prepare to cope appropriately with what is yet to happen. In 1912 one of Pavlov’s students (I.P. Feokritova) demonstrated that a dog accustomed to being fed every 30 minutes would begin to drool toward the end of each half-hour period. It was clear evidence of conditioning to time; the between-feedings interval itself served as a conditioned stimulus. That discovery underscores the ever-present periodicity of daily living, especially on the   level: rhythms of activity and sleep, rhythms of eating and lovemaking. As conditioning intervenes, anticipatory experiences of hunger, fatigue, or arousal serve our adaptation to ecological demands. Allowance should also be made for the daily, or   in metabolic activity (  daily cycles of temperature change). There is evidence that these fundamental biological functions can synchronize with the rhythmic phases of environmental (exogenous) change. Thus within a few days after a factory worker has been assigned to the night shift, highs and lows of his daily fluctuations of temperature will be inversed. The rhythmic changes in body temperature persists, nevertheless, suggesting an innate (endogenous) basis for circadian phenomena. Such a   would mean that the gradual establishment of human circadian rhythms of sleep or temperature results from maturation of the   rather than from conditioning in the strict sense. Experiments begun in 1962, in which men lived in caves or other enclosures for months deprived of temporal cues from the environment, also demonstrated the enduring nature of rhythms in body temperature and in sleep–wakefulness. The rhythmic periods, however, sometimes expanded, the subject beginning to live on an approximately two-day cycle without being aware of it. Through conditioning to time and by way of circadian rhythms, human physiology provides a kind of biological   that offers points of reference for   orientation.

(born June 22, 1919,  , Poland—died May 3, 1982,  , United Kingdom) Polish-born British social  , best known for his concept of social identity, a central idea in what became known as  . He is remembered in Europe for the effort he gave to establishing a European style of  , one that recognized the social, political, and historical   within which social behaviour takes place. Born into a Jewish family in  , Tajfel was a student at the Sorbonne in   when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. A fluent French speaker, he served in the French army, was captured by the invading German forces in 1940, and spent the rest of the conflict as a  . His survival depended on his assuming a French identity and concealing his Polish Jewish heritage. All of Tajfel’s immediate family and most of his friends in Poland were killed in the  . After the war, he spent six years helping to rehabilitate war victims and refugees and to repatriate or resettle them in other countries. Those events affected him deeply and provided him with important   signposts for his later research and writing on   against minorities and on how identity is shaped by nationality and ethnic group membership. Regarding his own wartime experience, he observed that, had his Polish Jewish identity been revealed, his fate would have been determined by his social category. Tajfel married in 1948 and moved to England in 1951. As an undergraduate student at Birkbeck,  , he won a scholarship for an essay on  . He graduated in 1954, worked as a research assistant at the University of Durham, and later became a lecturer in social psychology at the  . In 1967 he was appointed to a chair in social psychology at   University, a post that he held until his death. Bristol soon became a European centre for research in social psychology. Tajfel’s earliest published research was based on what was termed the “new look” in the theory of  , which emphasized that perception is an active rather than a reactive process. People’s mental processes often organize everyday stimuli according to values or needs that are current or   at that moment. For example, a meat eater who is very hungry might mistake a blurred photographic image of a red flower for a juicy steak. Tajfel incorporated such ideas into his work on perceptual accentuation. In one study, the stimuli were eight lines that differed in length by a constant increment. He showed that a simple manipulation (labeling each line either A or B) in an experimental setting caused subjects to misperceive the lines’ lengths and to categorize them accordingly. The concept of accentuation fit with Tajfel’s thinking about social  : members of   are misperceived to fit more closely to   commonly held about them. An important development in Tajfel’s thinking was revealed in a 1970 paper,  “Experiments in Intergroup Discrimination,” in which he explored the concept of social categorization (the classification of people as members of social groups) as a basis for intergroup discrimination (discrimination by members of one group against members of another group). In contrast to realistic group-conflict theory, according to which intergroup conflict derives from mutually incompatible goals, Tajfel proposed that the simple act of becoming a group member is sufficient to precipitate discrimination against members of an available comparison out-group. Thus, intergroup conflict is the result of social categorization rather than competition for   rewards. In Tajfel’s view, social categorization, not intergroup competition, is the key to    . Tajfel and his student  John Turner developed social identity theory in the 1970s. Among the key ideas of social identity theory are the following: 1. Social categorization is a   tool. It is a more powerful determinant of intergroup discrimination than are individual-level variables, such as personality characteristics, which might be shared by both in-group and out-group members. The key to understanding out-group prejudice is that individuals know that they are members of discrete categories—i.e., groups. 2. Social comparison is an intergroup concept, giving rise to   based on group membership. For example, Jane decides that she is advantaged by her   because it confers a higher status when she makes comparisons with other salient ethnic groups. Tajfel’s concept of social comparison contrasts with that of the American cognitive psychologist  , who posited an individual-level concept giving rise to inferences based on interpersonal comparisons. For example, Jim concludes that he is fast because he usually wins footraces against other individuals. 3. Social identity is a crucial aspect of identity. It is part of the self concept and is derived from the knowledge that one belongs to one or more social groups, such as a political or religious group. An individual   to achieve positive self-definition, an outcome based on comparisons that advantage the in-group over salient out-groups. 4. Tajfel’s concept of   is thought by some to be his most innovative contribution to social identity theory. Social change is a significant perceived alteration in the relationship between large social groups, such as national, religious, and ethnic groups. Whereas   is a change in self-definition—as when an individual moves into a new group—social change applies to a transformation of social identity for an entire  . Social change is the process by which people actively seek positive social identities in response to being defined negatively in a world of social inequality. Tajfel drew widely on theory and examples from history,  ,  ,  , and   in elaborating his ideas. He went to considerable lengths to link social identity theory to large-scale social structures and to  . Unlike many theorists in social psychology, Tajfel made a deliberate connection with   movements and political action. Although Tajfel conducted experimental research and encouraged others to do the same, his goals were more ambitious, and he was explicitly opposed to reductionism in social psychological theory. He was mindful of the scope and magnitude of North American social psychology and what it had achieved in defining the   in the 20th century. However, he was convinced that a European perspective could offer something different and valuable. He argued that North American social psychologists were mostly reductionist, even myopic, in their pursuit of psychological laws that applied primarily to individuals rather than to groups. In contrast, Europe’s political history and wars created a need for theoretical constructs that were embedded in social groups.

Space perception provides cues, such as depth and distance, that are important for movement and orientation to the  . Human beings have been interested in the   of objects in space at least since antiquity. It was popularly thought in   that objects could be seen because they emitted what was imagined to be a continuous series of extremely thin “membranes” in their own image; these fell upon the eye and merged into the picture that was perceived. Centuries of experimental research led to a more tenable   in which space was described in terms of three   or planes: height (vertical plane), width (horizontal plane), and depth (sagittal plane). These planes all intersect at right angles, and their single axis of intersection is defined as being located within perceived three-dimensional space—that is, in the “eye” of the perceiving individual. Humans do not ordinarily perceive a binocular space (a separate visual world from each eye) but instead see a so-called  , as if the images from each eye fuse to produce a single visual field akin to that of Cyclops, a one-eyed giant in  . The horizontal, vertical, and sagittal planes divide space into various sectors: something is perceived as “above” or “below” (the horizontal plane), as “in front of” or “behind” (the vertical plane), or as “to the right” or “to the left” (of the sagittal plane). An early theory put forth by the Anglican bishop   at the beginning of the 18th century was that the third dimension (depth) cannot be directly perceived by the eyes because the retinal image of any object is two-dimensional, as in a painting. He held that the ability to have visual experiences of depth is not inborn but can result only from logical deduction based on   learning through the use of other senses such as touch. Although modern research fails to verify Berkeley’s emphasis on reason as central to perception, contemporary theories still include both nativistic (inborn) and empirical (learned through experience) considerations. The study of   developed rapidly in the second half of the 19th century and still more rapidly during the 20th. Many psychologists who deal with perceptual function hold that the study of space perception is rapidly becoming a distinct branch of   in its own right. This special field within psychology concentrates on the factors contributing to the perceived organization of objects in space (e.g., on cues to depth perception, movement, form, colour, and their interactions) or dwells on particularly interesting special problems such as that of  amodal perception (e.g., the question of how one perceives that there are six sides to a cube, even though only three of them can be seen at a single time). Space perception research also offers insight into ways that perceptual   helps orient the individual to the environment. Specifically, orientation in space typically seems to reflect one’s strivings (e.g., to seek food or to avoid injury). People could not orient themselves to their  , however, unless the environmental information reaching them through the various sense organs offered a perception of space that corresponds to their physical “reality.” Such perception is called  veridical perception—the direct perception of stimuli as they exist. Without some degree of veridicality concerning physical space, one cannot seek food, flee from enemies, or even socialize. Veridical perception also causes a person to experience changing stimuli as if they were stable: even though the sensory image of an approaching tiger grows larger, for example, one tends to perceive that the animal’s size remains unchanged. In other words, one perceives objects in the environment as having relatively constant   (as to size, colour, and so on) despite considerable variations in stimulus conditions. Not all perception of space, however, is veridical; instead, perception may fail to correspond to reality—often in some systematic way. These are cases of nonveridical perception. Experiments have shown that the three basic spatial planes (horizontal, vertical, and sagittal) dominate the ability of the individual to localize visual objects in nearby space. Often, objects can be perceived as   closer to these basic dimensions or planes than they really are. (Part of the explanation of these perceptual discrepancies in visual experience may lie in the force of  .) Nonveridical perceptions do not generate   in one’s perception of space. Instead, they clarify the perceived characteristics of surrounding space. If all of the mass of sensory information available at a given moment were perceived veridically, the flood of data might confuse the perceiver to the point of disorientation. In other words, some degree of selectivity in perception appears to guide the survival of the individual. Ideally, information about the environment is perceived only as it is relevant to the goals, needs, or physiological state of the individual at a given moment.

(born January 27, 1904, McConnelsville,  , U.S.—died December 11, 1979,  , New York) American psychologist whose theories of visual   were influential among some schools of   and   in the late 20th century. After receiving a Ph.D. in psychology at   in 1928, Gibson joined the faculty of  . He married   (née Jack)—who would become a prominent psychologist in her own right—in 1932. During   he served in the Army Air Forces (1942–46), where he did research on visual aircraft identification and on increasing the effectiveness of training films, among other topics. After the war he returned to Smith College before moving to   in 1949. He retired in 1972. Gibson developed what he called an “ecological approach” to the study of visual perception, according to which humans perceive their   directly, without mediation by   processes or by mental entities such as  . Perceiving a tree, for example, does not consist of constructing a mental image of a tree from stimuli (light energy) entering the visual system and then attributing the visual properties of the image to the tree itself. Instead, one directly sees the visual properties of the tree. This idea was radical because it contradicted a centuries-old model of the origins of human knowledge. As Gibson himself put it, “The old idea that sensory inputs are converted into perceptions by operations of the   is rejected.” Gibson created a highly influential theory of “ affordances,” which are qualities of an object or   that communicate opportunities to do certain things (e.g., dark shade indicates an opportunity to get out of the sunshine; a thick cushion signals the availability of comfortable seating). According to Gibson, affordances exist naturally and are directly perceived by the viewer. His work had a large impact in  , or  , which is partly concerned with the perceived affordances in products designed for human use. In addition to   (1979), Gibson’s most important writings include   (1950) and    (1966). His followers organized the International Society for Ecological Psychology in 1981.

A number of     have been shown to be associated with creative productivity. One of these is autonomy: creative individuals tend to be independent and nonconformist in their thoughts and actions. Equally important is mastery of a particular domain—that is, a sphere of activity or   that requires a high level of ability. For example, in applying their knowledge of computers to the design of the Apple II, inventors   and   revolutionized the computer industry by appealing to individuals as well as businesses. French fashion designer   forever changed the way women dressed by designing simple yet stylish clothes. On the other hand, creative people may not have equally strong gifts across the spectrum of human ability. (A notable exception was  , whose achievements in the visual arts, mechanics, and engineering disclosed the talents of a creative polymath.) Some creative people show an interest in apparent disorder, contradiction, and imbalance—perhaps because they are challenged by asymmetry and  . Creative individuals may also exhibit a high degree of self-assurance. Some possess an exceptionally deep, broad, and flexible awareness of themselves. Others are shown to be   leaders with a great sensitivity to problems. The unconventionality of thought that is sometimes found in creative persons may be in part a resistance to  , which may be seen as demanding surrender of one’s unique fundamental nature. In fact, independence is critical to the creative process, in that creative people must often be able to work alone and must also be willing to express ideas or develop products that others might perceive as radical. It should be pointed out, however, that a nonconformist lifestyle is not essential to creativity; indeed, many creative individuals lead quite ordinary lives, expressing their   mainly in their unconventional ideas and work. Another trait common among creative people is that of introversion. While this does not imply a lack of social skills, it suggests that creative people tend to be reflective and inner-directed; they look to their own   rather than depending upon interaction with others to inform their attitudes and responses. A third crucial characteristic combines  curiosity and problem seeking. Creative individuals seem to have a need to seek novelty and an ability to pose unique questions. In   (1995), for example, the American psychologists   and Todd Lubart likened the combined traits of autonomy and   to buying low and selling high in the “marketplace of ideas.” By this they meant that the creative individual identifies a unique need—perhaps a problem or opportunity that no one else recognizes. This is the “buying low” phase, because it typically involves dismissing a popular solution and embracing an unheard-of solution or an   that has no  . When creative persons find a better solution, they then work toward “selling” others on the concept. This process can be seen in the work of inventors such as  , who designed a number of household and industrial devices,  , who designed text scanners and speech-recognition software, and  , whose numerous inventions include medical devices, water-purification systems, and the IBOT, a  . High   is common in creative persons, yet while they can meet the problems of life as rationally as anyone else can, their intellect does not rule at the expense of intuition or other seemingly nonrational influences. Most studies of the relationship of creativity to intelligence have also shown that extreme general intelligence does not necessarily kindle creativity. Findings such as these contributed to the “threshold” model of intelligence and creativity, which claims that, above a certain level, intelligence has little correlation with creativity—i.e., a highly intelligent person may not be as highly creative. It may be that intelligence sets the limits on the amount of information a person can learn and retain, while creative thinking provides the flexibility necessary for the original production of ideas. A distinction is sometimes made between  convergent thinking (the     measured by intelligence tests) and   (exemplified by a richness of ideas and originality of thought). Both seem necessary to creative performance, although the degree of each varies according to the task or occupation (i.e., a mathematician may exhibit more convergent than divergent thinking, while an artist would exhibit the reverse).  experiments in the fields of   and   have demonstrated the power of novelty as an inducement to action. This stems from the tension that exists between the regularity of daily life and interruptions that bring possibilities of new experience. Psychological studies of highly creative people have characterized this tension in terms of such dualities as intellect and  , the conscious and the  ,   and  , the conventional and the unconventional, and complexity and simplicity. Other qualities of creative individuals were identified by the American educational psychologist  E. Paul Torrance. They include fluency, or the ability to think of many ideas rapidly; flexibility, the capacity to use ideas and tools in unusual ways; and originality, the capacity to think of novel ideas and products. In 1966 Torrance and his colleagues developed a means of  , the  Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT), that accounts for all of these skills. The TTCT became one of the most widely used measures of creativity. Torrance provided additional support for his approach in follow-up studies of his subjects after 7, 12, and 22 years, and the passage of time has shown the TTCT to be among the more valid of all creativity tests.

(born March 12, 1685, near Dysert Castle, near Thomastown?, County  , Ireland—died January 14, 1753,  , England) was an Anglo-Irish Anglican  ,  , and scientist best known for his empiricist and idealist  , which holds that reality consists only of minds and their ideas; everything save the spiritual exists only insofar as it is   by the  . Berkeley was the eldest son of William Berkeley, described as a “gentleman” in George’s matriculation entry and as a commissioned officer, a cornet of dragoons, in the entry of a younger brother. Brought up at Dysert Castle, Berkeley entered Kilkenny College in 1696 and  , Dublin, in 1700, where he graduated with a B.A. degree in 1704. While awaiting a fellowship vacancy, he made a critical study of  ,  , and the   that there is no material substance. The principal influences upon his   were  , represented by the English philosopher  , and Continental  , represented by  . His first publication,   and   (published together in 1707), was probably a fellowship thesis. Elected fellow of Trinity College in 1707, Berkeley began to “examine and revise” his “first arguings” in his revision notebooks. The revision was drastic and its results revolutionary. His old principle was largely superseded by his new principle; i.e., his original line of   for immaterialism, based on the   of  ,  , and the other    , was replaced by a simple, profound analysis of the meaning of “ ” or “to exist.” “To be,” said of the  , means to be perceived; “to be,” said of the subject, means to perceive. In what came to be known as the “master argument,” Berkeley called attention to the situation that exists when a person perceives something or imagines it. He argued that, when a person imagines trees or books “and no body by to perceive them,” he is failing to appreciate the whole situation: he is “omitting” the perceiver, for imagined trees or books are necessarily imagined as perceivable. The situation for him is a two-term relation of perceiver and perceived; there is no third term, an “  of” the object, coming between perceiver and perceived. Elsewhere he argued that, because “all sensible objects” are things “we perceive by sense,” and because nothing is perceived “besides our own ideas,” it follows that all sensible objects are ideas. The revision was a gradual development. At the start Berkeley held that nothing exists but “conscious things.” “On second thoughts,” he was certain of the existence of bodies and knew intuitively “the existence of other things besides ourselves.” His expressions, “in the  ” and “without the mind,” must be understood accordingly. As he wrote in his notebook,   and colour (which philosophers had classed as secondary qualities because of their supposed subjectivity) are “as much without the mind” as figure and   (classed as primary qualities) or as time. For both primary and secondary qualities are in the mind in such a way as to be in the thing and are in the thing in such a way as to be in the mind. The mind does not become red, blue, or extended when those qualities are in it; they are not modes or attributes of mind. Colour and extension are not mental qualities for Berkeley: colour can be seen, and extension can be touched; they are “sensible ideas,” or  , the direct objects of percipient mind. Berkeley accepted possible   as well as actual perception; i.e., he accepted the existence of what a person is not actually perceiving but might perceive if he took the appropriate steps. The opposite view was held by some philosophers, including  , who in Berkeley’s words “are by their own principles forced” to accept it. They are forced to accept that objects actually seen and touched have only an   existence, that they come into existence when perceived and pass into nothingness when no longer perceived. Berkeley treated those views with respect: he denied that they are absurd. But he did not hold them, and he explicitly denied that they follow from his principles. In effect he said to his readers, “You may hold, if you will, that objects of sense have only an ‘in-and-out’  , that they are created and   with every turn of man’s attention; but do not father those views on me. I do not hold them.” In his notebook he wrote, “Existence is   or   The horse is in the stable, the Books are in the study as before.” Horse and books, when not being actually perceived by any person, are still there, still perceivable, “still with relation to perception.” To a nonphilosophical friend Berkeley wrote, “I question not the existence of anything that we perceive by our senses.” Berkeley’s immaterialism is open to “gross misinterpretation,” as he said in his preface; rightly understood, it is common sense. Like most people, he accepted and built on “two heads,” “two kinds entirely distinct and heterogeneous”: (1) active mind or spirit, perceiving, thinking, and willing, and (2) passive objects of mind, namely sensible ideas (sense-data) or imaginable ideas.

While a student at  , Land became interested in  ,   light in which all rays are aligned in the same plane. He took a leave of absence, and, after intensive study and experimentation, succeeded (1932) in aligning submicroscopic crystals of iodoquinine sulfate and embedding them in a sheet of plastic. The resulting polarizer, for which he   numerous uses and which he dubbed Polaroid J sheet, was a tremendous advance. It allowed the use of almost any size of polarizer and significantly reduced the cost. With George Wheelwright III, a Harvard   instructor, Land founded the  ,  , in 1932. He developed and, in 1936, began to use numerous types of Polaroid material in sunglasses and other optical devices. Polaroid was later used in camera filters and other optical equipment. Land founded the Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, Mass., in 1937. Four years later he developed a widely used, three-dimensional motion-picture process based on polarized light. During   he applied the polarizing principle to various types of military equipment. Land began work on an instantaneous developing film after the war. In 1947 he demonstrated a camera (known as the  ) that produced a finished print in 60 seconds. The Land photographic process soon found numerous commercial, military, and scientific applications. Many   were made in the following years, including the development of a colour process. Land’s Polaroid Land cameras, which were able to produce developed photographs within one minute after the exposure, became some of the most popular cameras in the world. Land’s interest in light and colour resulted in a new theory of  . In a series of experiments he revealed certain conflicts in the classical theory of colour perception. He found that the colour perceived is not dependent on the relative amounts of blue, green, and red light entering the eye; he proposed that at least three independent image-forming mechanisms, which he called retinexes, are sensitive to different colours and work in   to indicate the colour seen. Land received more than 500 patents for his innovations in light and plastics. In 1980 he retired as   of Polaroid but remained active in the field of light and colour research by working with the  , a nonprofit centre supported by the Rowland Foundation, Inc., a corporation that Land founded in 1960. Under Land’s direction, Rowland researchers discovered that perception of light and colour is regulated essentially by the brain, rather than through a spectrum system in the retina of the eye, as was previously believed.

From the perspective of educators, critical     both a set of   skills that can be taught and a   toward reflective open inquiry that can be  . The term   was coined by American philosopher and educator   in the book   (1910) and was adopted by the progressive   movement as a core instructional goal that offered a   modern   to traditional educational methods such as rote memorization. Critical thinking is characterized by a broad set of related skills usually including the abilities to Theorists have noted that such skills are only valuable insofar as a person is inclined to use them. Consequently, they emphasize that certain habits of   are necessary components of critical thinking. This disposition may include curiosity, open-mindedness, self-awareness,  , and persistence. Although there is a generally accepted set of qualities that are associated with critical thinking, scholarly writing about the term has highlighted disagreements over its exact   and whether and how it differs from related concepts such as  . In addition, some theorists have insisted that critical thinking be regarded and valued as a process and not as a goal-oriented skill set to be used to solve problems. Critical-thinking theory has also been accused of reflecting patriarchal assumptions about knowledge and ways of knowing that are inherently   against women. Dewey, who also used the term  , connected critical thinking to a tradition of rational inquiry associated with modern  . From the turn of the 20th century, he and others working in the overlapping fields of  ,  , and educational theory sought to rigorously apply the   to understand and define the process of thinking. They conceived critical thinking to be related to the scientific method but more open, flexible, and self-correcting; instead of a recipe or a series of steps, critical thinking would be a wider set of skills, patterns, and strategies that allow someone to reason through an   topic, constantly reassessing assumptions and potential explanations in order to arrive at a sound judgment and understanding. In the   movement in the  , critical thinking was seen as a crucial component of raising citizens in a   society. Instead of imparting a particular series of lessons or   only   subject matter, theorists thought that teachers should train students in how to think. As critical thinkers, such students would be equipped to be productive and engaged citizens who could cooperate and rationally overcome differences   in a pluralistic society. Beginning in the 1970s and ’80s, critical thinking as a key outcome of school and   curriculum leapt to the forefront of U.S. education policy. In an atmosphere of renewed   competition and amid reports of declining U.S. test scores, there were growing fears that the quality of education in the United States was falling and that students were unprepared. In response, a concerted effort was made to systematically define curriculum goals and   standardized testing  , and critical-thinking skills were frequently included as a crucially important outcome of a successful education. A notable event in this movement was the release of the 1980 report of the Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities that called for the   to include critical thinking on its list of “basic skills.” Three years later the   system   a policy that required every undergraduate student to complete a course in critical thinking. Critical thinking continued to be put forward as a central goal of education in the early 21st century. Its ubiquity in the   of education policy and in such guidelines as the Common Core State Standards in the United States generated some   that the concept itself was both overused and ill-defined. In addition, an   was made by teachers, theorists, and others that educators were not being adequately trained to teach critical thinking.

(born June 22, 1919,  , Poland—died May 3, 1982,  , United Kingdom) Polish-born British social  , best known for his concept of social identity, a central idea in what became known as  . He is remembered in Europe for the effort he gave to establishing a European style of  , one that recognized the social, political, and historical   within which social behaviour takes place. Born into a Jewish family in  , Tajfel was a student at the Sorbonne in   when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. A fluent French speaker, he served in the French army, was captured by the invading German forces in 1940, and spent the rest of the conflict as a  . His survival depended on his assuming a French identity and concealing his Polish Jewish heritage. All of Tajfel’s immediate family and most of his friends in Poland were killed in the  . After the war, he spent six years helping to rehabilitate war victims and refugees and to repatriate or resettle them in other countries. Those events affected him deeply and provided him with important   signposts for his later research and writing on   against minorities and on how identity is shaped by nationality and ethnic group membership. Regarding his own wartime experience, he observed that, had his Polish Jewish identity been revealed, his fate would have been determined by his social category. Tajfel married in 1948 and moved to England in 1951. As an undergraduate student at Birkbeck,  , he won a scholarship for an essay on  . He graduated in 1954, worked as a research assistant at the University of Durham, and later became a lecturer in social psychology at the  . In 1967 he was appointed to a chair in social psychology at   University, a post that he held until his death. Bristol soon became a European centre for research in social psychology. Tajfel’s earliest published research was based on what was termed the “new look” in the theory of  , which emphasized that perception is an active rather than a reactive process. People’s mental processes often organize everyday stimuli according to values or needs that are current or   at that moment. For example, a meat eater who is very hungry might mistake a blurred photographic image of a red flower for a juicy steak. Tajfel incorporated such ideas into his work on perceptual accentuation. In one study, the stimuli were eight lines that differed in length by a constant increment. He showed that a simple manipulation (labeling each line either A or B) in an experimental setting caused subjects to misperceive the lines’ lengths and to categorize them accordingly. The concept of accentuation fit with Tajfel’s thinking about social  : members of   are misperceived to fit more closely to   commonly held about them. An important development in Tajfel’s thinking was revealed in a 1970 paper,  “Experiments in Intergroup Discrimination,” in which he explored the concept of social categorization (the classification of people as members of social groups) as a basis for intergroup discrimination (discrimination by members of one group against members of another group). In contrast to realistic group-conflict theory, according to which intergroup conflict derives from mutually incompatible goals, Tajfel proposed that the simple act of becoming a group member is sufficient to precipitate discrimination against members of an available comparison out-group. Thus, intergroup conflict is the result of social categorization rather than competition for   rewards. In Tajfel’s view, social categorization, not intergroup competition, is the key to    . Tajfel and his student  John Turner developed social identity theory in the 1970s. Among the key ideas of social identity theory are the following: 1. Social categorization is a   tool. It is a more powerful determinant of intergroup discrimination than are individual-level variables, such as personality characteristics, which might be shared by both in-group and out-group members. The key to understanding out-group prejudice is that individuals know that they are members of discrete categories—i.e., groups. 2. Social comparison is an intergroup concept, giving rise to   based on group membership. For example, Jane decides that she is advantaged by her   because it confers a higher status when she makes comparisons with other salient ethnic groups. Tajfel’s concept of social comparison contrasts with that of the American cognitive psychologist  , who posited an individual-level concept giving rise to inferences based on interpersonal comparisons. For example, Jim concludes that he is fast because he usually wins footraces against other individuals. 3. Social identity is a crucial aspect of identity. It is part of the self concept and is derived from the knowledge that one belongs to one or more social groups, such as a political or religious group. An individual   to achieve positive self-definition, an outcome based on comparisons that advantage the in-group over salient out-groups. 4. Tajfel’s concept of   is thought by some to be his most innovative contribution to social identity theory. Social change is a significant perceived alteration in the relationship between large social groups, such as national, religious, and ethnic groups. Whereas   is a change in self-definition—as when an individual moves into a new group—social change applies to a transformation of social identity for an entire  . Social change is the process by which people actively seek positive social identities in response to being defined negatively in a world of social inequality. Tajfel drew widely on theory and examples from history,  ,  ,  , and   in elaborating his ideas. He went to considerable lengths to link social identity theory to large-scale social structures and to  . Unlike many theorists in social psychology, Tajfel made a deliberate connection with   movements and political action. Although Tajfel conducted experimental research and encouraged others to do the same, his goals were more ambitious, and he was explicitly opposed to reductionism in social psychological theory. He was mindful of the scope and magnitude of North American social psychology and what it had achieved in defining the   in the 20th century. However, he was convinced that a European perspective could offer something different and valuable. He argued that North American social psychologists were mostly reductionist, even myopic, in their pursuit of psychological laws that applied primarily to individuals rather than to groups. In contrast, Europe’s political history and wars created a need for theoretical constructs that were embedded in social groups.

Content: Literary critics, historians, avid readers, and even casual readers will all have different opinions on which novel is truly the “greatest book ever written.” Is it a novel with beautiful, captivating figurative language? Or one with gritty realism? A novel that has had an immense social impact? Or one that has more subtly affected the world? Here is a list of 12 novels that, for various reasons, have been considered some of the greatest works of literature ever written.  Any fan of stories that involve juicy subjects like adultery, gambling, marriage plots, and, well, Russian feudalism, would instantly place   at the peak of their “greatest novels” list. And that’s exactly the ranking that publications like   magazine have given the novel since it was published in its entirety in 1878. Written by Russian novelist  , the eight-part towering work of fiction tells the story of two major characters: a tragic, disenchanted housewife, the titular  , who runs off with her young lover, and a lovestruck landowner named  , who struggles in faith and philosophy. Tolstoy molds together thoughtful discussions on love, pain, and family in Russian society with a sizable cast of characters regarded for their realistic humanity. The novel was especially revolutionary in its treatment of women, depicting prejudices and social hardships of the time with vivid emotion. , believed to be one of the most influential authors to have ever existed, famously published only a single novel (up until its controversial sequel was published in 2015 just before her death). Lee’s   was published in 1960 and became an immediate classic of literature. The novel examines racism in the American South through the innocent wide eyes of a clever young girl named Jean Louise (“Scout”) Finch. Its iconic characters, most notably the sympathetic and just lawyer and father Atticus Finch, served as role models and changed perspectives in the United States at a time when tensions regarding race were high.   earned the   for fiction in 1961 and was made into an  , giving the story and its characters further life and influence over the American social sphere. ’s   is distinguished as one of the greatest texts for introducing students to the art of reading literature critically (which means you may have read it in school). The novel is told from the perspective of a young man named   who has recently moved to New York City and is befriended by his eccentric nouveau riche neighbor with mysterious origins,  .   provides an insider’s look into the Jazz Age of the 1920s in United States history while at the same time critiquing the idea of the “American Dream.” Perhaps the most famous aspect of the novel is its cover art—a piercing face projected onto a dark blue night sky and lights from a cityscape—an image that is also found, in a slightly different configuration, within the text itself as a key symbol. The late Colombian author   published his most famous work,  , in 1967. The novel tells the story of seven generations of the Buendía family and follows the establishment of their town Macondo until its destruction along with the last of the family’s descendents. In fantastical form, the novel explores the genre of   by emphasizing the extraordinary nature of commonplace things while mystical things are shown to be common. Márquez highlights the prevalence and power of myth and folktale in relating history and Latin American culture. The novel won many awards for Márquez, leading the way to his eventual honor of the   for Literature in 1982 for his entire body of work, of which   is often lauded as his most triumphant.  wrote his novel   after multiple trips to the country throughout his early life. The book was published in 1924 and follows a Muslim Indian doctor named   and his relationships with an English professor, Cyril Fielding, and a visiting English schoolteacher named  . When Adela believes that Aziz has assaulted her while on a trip to the Marabar caves near the fictional city of Chandrapore, where the story is set, tensions between the Indian community and the colonial British community rise. The possibility of friendship and connection between English and Indian people, despite their cultural differences and imperial tensions, is explored in the conflict. The novel’s colorful descriptions of nature, the landscape of India, and the figurative power that they are given within the text solidifies it as a great work of fiction. Often confused with H.G. Wells’s science-fiction novella of nearly the same name (just subtract a “The”),  ’s   is a groundbreaking novel in the expression of identity for the African American male. The narrator of the novel, a man who is never named but believes he is “invisible” to others socially, tells the story of his move from the South to college and then to New York City. In each location he faces extreme adversity and discrimination, falling into and out of work, relationships, and questionable social movements in a wayward and ethereal mindset. The novel is renowned for its surreal and experimental style of writing that explores the symbolism surrounding African American identity and culture.   won the U.S.   for Fiction in 1953. ’s  , perhaps the most influential and well-known work of Spanish literature, was first published in full in 1615. The novel, which is very regularly regarded as one of the best literary works of all time, tells the story of   and sets off in a fit of obsession over romantic novels about   to revive the custom and become a hero himself. The character of Don Quixote has become an idol and somewhat of an archetypal character, influencing many major works of art, music, and literature since the novel’s publication. The text has been so influential that a word,  , based on the Don Quixote character, was created to describe someone who is, “foolishly impractical especially in the pursuit of ideals; especially: marked by rash lofty romantic ideas or extravagantly chivalrous action.” ’s 1987 spiritual and haunting novel   tells the story of an escaped slave named Sethe who has fled to Cincinnati, Ohio, in the year 1873. The novel investigates the trauma of slavery even after freedom has been gained, depicting Sethe’s guilt and emotional pain after having killed her own child, whom she named Beloved, to keep her from living life as a slave. A spectral figure appears in the lives of the characters and goes by the same name as the child, embodying the family’s anguish and hardship and making their feelings and past unavoidable. The novel was lauded for addressing the psychological effects of slavery and the importance of family and community in healing.   was awarded the   for fiction in 1988. Possibly the most idiosyncratic novel of this list,  ’s   describes exactly one day in the life of a British socialite named Clarissa Dalloway. Using a combination of a third-person narration and the thoughts of various characters, the novel uses a stream-of-consciousness style all the way through. The result of this style is a deeply personal and revealing look into the characters’ minds, with the novel relying heavily on character rather than plot to tell its story. The thoughts of the characters include constant regrets and thoughts of the past, their struggles with mental illness and post-traumatic stress from World War I, and the effect of social pressures. The novel’s unique style, subject, and time setting make it one of the most respected and regarded works of all time.  The Western canon of “great literature” often focuses on writers who come from North America or Europe and often ignores accomplished writers and amazing works of literature from other parts of the world.  ’s  , published in 1958, is one such work of Nigerian literature that had to overcome the bias of some literary circles and one that has been able to gain recognition worldwide despite it. The novel follows an Igbo man named Okonkwo, describing his family, the village in Nigeria where he lives, and the effects of British colonialism on his native country. The novel is an example of African postcolonial literature, a genre that has grown in size and recognition since the mid-1900s as African people have been able to share their often unheard stories of imperialism from the perspective of the colonized. The novel is frequently assigned for reading in courses on world literature and African studies. ’s  , another novel often assigned for reading in school, was initially published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currer Bell to disguise the fact that the writer was a woman. Fortunately, a lot has changed with regard to women in literature since 1847, and Brontë now receives the credit she deserves for one of the most groundbreaking novels about women in history. At a time when the author felt compelled to hide her true identity,   provided a story of individualism for women. The novel’s eponymous character rises from being orphaned and poor into a successful and independent woman. The work combines themes from both Gothic and Victorian literature, revolutionizing the art of the novel by focusing on the growth in Jane’s sensibility with internalized action and writing. Though the   (a novel in the form of letters written by one or more characters) was most popular before the 19th century,   became a champion of the style with her 1982 novel  , which won a   and a  . Set in the post-Civil War American South, the novel follows a young African American girl named Celie into adulthood in letters she writes to   and to her sister Nettie. Celie faces   by her father and eventually her husband, chronicling her own suffering and growth as well as that of her friends and family. The novel explores themes of  ,  , gender, sexual orientation, and disability through its grouping of disadvantaged and damaged characters who, over time, grow to shape their own lives. The story was adapted into an  -nominated   in 1985 that, despite widespread critical acclaim, was notoriously snubbed of all 11 awards it was nominated for.

Content: Cruel and fickle, passionate and vindictive, jealous and insecure, petty and insane: the inhabitants of Mount Olympus represent an attempt by the ancient Greeks to explain the chaos of the universe through human nature. Thus, like every deity invented before and since, these gods and goddesses are embodiments of human solipsism. (Of course lightning is caused by a giant, angry man in the sky…obvi. I mean, what else could it be?) The stories of their battles, bickering, and sexual conquests have indelibly influenced the course of Western language and narrative. Here is a selection of some of the A-list names of the Greek pantheon.  was the goddess of love, sex, and beauty. Unsurprisingly for a love goddess, she was said to have emerged from the foam generated when the severed testicles of her father, Uranus, were thrown into the sea by his son, the Titan Cronus. (Or   that surprising?) Kind of makes Botticelli’s surreally lovely  —which depicts Aphrodite’s   emerging from the waves—a little more visceral, doesn’t it?  was the goddess of reason, wisdom, and war.

And sacrificing dogs…yeah, that’s right, Ares liked dead puppies. Jerk. His Roman equivalent was  . The twin brother of Artemis,   was among the most important (read: feared) of the gods.

While searching for her stolen daughter, she accepted the hospitality of the royal family of Eleusis. The  , perhaps the most important religious rites in ancient Greece, are attributed to her teachings. Her Roman equivalent was  .  was a son of Zeus born to a mortal mother. When Zeus accidentally killed her, he sewed the young Dionysus into his thigh and, when the young god emerged, passed him to the care of the maenads. The cult of Dionysus revolved around intoxication, sex, and savage ritual sacrifice. He was often symbolized by a bull due to his association with the sacrificial animal. Elements of his character are seen in the Roman god of wine, Bacchus.  ruled the world of the dead, with which he was sometimes synonymous. The chilly lord of the underworld was among the few Greek gods to come across as dispassionate. He was not the ultimate judge of the souls that wandered his domain nor did he mete out their punishments for sins committed during their mortal lives. He was, however, cunning; he tricked Persephone into eating enchanted pomegranate seeds so that she would have to remain with him for a portion of the year. The queen goddess of Olympus,   was both sister and wife to Zeus. Though she is often depicted as reserved and austere, she was mercilessly vindictive when it came to her husband’s [many] extramarital adventures. Unfortunately for the objects of Zeus’s godly affections, Hera tended to torment the "other women" (and their offspring, including Heracles) rather than Zeus himself. Her Roman equivalent was  .

(born March 12, 1685, near Dysert Castle, near Thomastown?, County  , Ireland—died January 14, 1753,  , England) was an Anglo-Irish Anglican  ,  , and scientist best known for his empiricist and idealist  , which holds that reality consists only of minds and their ideas; everything save the spiritual exists only insofar as it is   by the  . Berkeley was the eldest son of William Berkeley, described as a “gentleman” in George’s matriculation entry and as a commissioned officer, a cornet of dragoons, in the entry of a younger brother. Brought up at Dysert Castle, Berkeley entered Kilkenny College in 1696 and  , Dublin, in 1700, where he graduated with a B.A. degree in 1704. While awaiting a fellowship vacancy, he made a critical study of  ,  , and the   that there is no material substance. The principal influences upon his   were  , represented by the English philosopher  , and Continental  , represented by  . His first publication,   and   (published together in 1707), was probably a fellowship thesis. Elected fellow of Trinity College in 1707, Berkeley began to “examine and revise” his “first arguings” in his revision notebooks. The revision was drastic and its results revolutionary. His old principle was largely superseded by his new principle; i.e., his original line of   for immaterialism, based on the   of  ,  , and the other    , was replaced by a simple, profound analysis of the meaning of “ ” or “to exist.” “To be,” said of the  , means to be perceived; “to be,” said of the subject, means to perceive. In what came to be known as the “master argument,” Berkeley called attention to the situation that exists when a person perceives something or imagines it. He argued that, when a person imagines trees or books “and no body by to perceive them,” he is failing to appreciate the whole situation: he is “omitting” the perceiver, for imagined trees or books are necessarily imagined as perceivable. The situation for him is a two-term relation of perceiver and perceived; there is no third term, an “  of” the object, coming between perceiver and perceived. Elsewhere he argued that, because “all sensible objects” are things “we perceive by sense,” and because nothing is perceived “besides our own ideas,” it follows that all sensible objects are ideas. The revision was a gradual development. At the start Berkeley held that nothing exists but “conscious things.” “On second thoughts,” he was certain of the existence of bodies and knew intuitively “the existence of other things besides ourselves.” His expressions, “in the  ” and “without the mind,” must be understood accordingly. As he wrote in his notebook,   and colour (which philosophers had classed as secondary qualities because of their supposed subjectivity) are “as much without the mind” as figure and   (classed as primary qualities) or as time. For both primary and secondary qualities are in the mind in such a way as to be in the thing and are in the thing in such a way as to be in the mind. The mind does not become red, blue, or extended when those qualities are in it; they are not modes or attributes of mind. Colour and extension are not mental qualities for Berkeley: colour can be seen, and extension can be touched; they are “sensible ideas,” or  , the direct objects of percipient mind. Berkeley accepted possible   as well as actual perception; i.e., he accepted the existence of what a person is not actually perceiving but might perceive if he took the appropriate steps. The opposite view was held by some philosophers, including  , who in Berkeley’s words “are by their own principles forced” to accept it. They are forced to accept that objects actually seen and touched have only an   existence, that they come into existence when perceived and pass into nothingness when no longer perceived. Berkeley treated those views with respect: he denied that they are absurd. But he did not hold them, and he explicitly denied that they follow from his principles. In effect he said to his readers, “You may hold, if you will, that objects of sense have only an ‘in-and-out’  , that they are created and   with every turn of man’s attention; but do not father those views on me. I do not hold them.” In his notebook he wrote, “Existence is   or   The horse is in the stable, the Books are in the study as before.” Horse and books, when not being actually perceived by any person, are still there, still perceivable, “still with relation to perception.” To a nonphilosophical friend Berkeley wrote, “I question not the existence of anything that we perceive by our senses.” Berkeley’s immaterialism is open to “gross misinterpretation,” as he said in his preface; rightly understood, it is common sense. Like most people, he accepted and built on “two heads,” “two kinds entirely distinct and heterogeneous”: (1) active mind or spirit, perceiving, thinking, and willing, and (2) passive objects of mind, namely sensible ideas (sense-data) or imaginable ideas.

Content: One of the great   painters,   continually tested artistic traditions and techniques. He created innovative compositions, investigated anatomy to accurately represent the human body, considered the human psyche to illustrate character, and experimented with methods of representing space and three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface. The result of his inexhaustible curiosity is many unfinished projects but also some of the most lifelike, complex, and tender representations of human nature. His experiments influenced the art of his successors and often became the standard of representation in subsequent centuries. At his death in 1519, Leonardo left many notebooks filled with jottings and sketches but very few finished works. Some of his pieces were completed by assistants, but others were lost, destroyed, or overpainted. Below are 10 examples of some of his most well-known surviving works. The world’s most famous artwork, the   draws thousands of visitors to the   each day, many of whom are compelled by the sitter’s mysterious gaze and enigmatic smile. The seemingly ordinary portrait of a young woman dressed modestly in a thin veil, somber colors, and no jewelry might also confound its viewers, who may wonder what all the fuss is about. The painting’s simplicity belies Leonardo’s talent for realism. The subject’s softly modeled face shows his skillful handling of  , an artistic technique that uses subtle gradations of light and shadow, rather than line, to model form. The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric reveal Leonardo’s tireless patience in recreating his studied observations. Moreover, the sitter’s perplexing expression only adds to her realism. Her smile might be engaging or it might be mocking—  because, like a human, she is a complex figure, embodying contrary characteristics simultaneously. One of the most famous paintings in the world, the   was commissioned by  , duke of Milan and Leonardo’s patron during his first stay in that city, for the Dominican monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie. Depicting a sequential narrative, Leonardo illustrates several closely connected moments in the Gospels, including Matthew 26:21–28, in which Jesus declares that one of the Apostles will betray him and then institutes the  . Leonardo, who was intrigued by the manner in which a man’s character can reveal itself in posture, expression, and gesture, depicted each disciple’s unique reaction to the declaration. The Apostles’ postures rise, fall, extend, and intertwine as they appear to whisper, yell, grieve, and debate around Jesus, who sits serenely in the center. Because of Leonardo’s experimental painting technique, in which he used tempera or oil paint on two layers of preparatory ground, the work began to disintegrate soon after he finished it. Viewers, however, can still recognize it as a complex study of varied human emotion, revealed in a deceptively simple composition. Leonardo’s pen-and-ink drawing   comes from one of the many notebooks that he kept on hand during his mature years. It is accompanied by notes, written in mirror script, on the ideal human proportions that the Roman architect   laid out in a book on architecture from the 1st century BCE. The drawing illustrates Vitruvius’s theory that the ideal human could fit within a circle and a square, two irreconcilable shapes. Leonardo resolved the concept by drawing a male figure in two superimposed positions—one with his arms outstretched to fit in a square and another with his legs and arms spread in a circle. The work shows not only Leonardo’s effort to understand significant texts but also his desire to expand on them. He was not the first to illustrate Vitruvius’s concepts, but his drawing later became the most iconic, partly because its combination of mathematics, philosophy, and art seemed a fitting symbol of the Renaissance. The drawing is now housed in the  , where it is not typically on display but kept in a climate-controlled archive.  Long regarded as a self-portrait, the red chalk drawing of an old man with long wavy hair and a beard has been reproduced to such an extent that it defines how most people think of Leonardo’s appearance. Yet some scholars argue that the figure, with its craggy features, furrowed brow, and downcast eyes, appears much older than the age Leonardo ever reached; Leonardo died at age 67. They propose that the drawing may be one of his grotesque drawings, sketches he habitually made in his notebooks of people with eccentric features. Whomever the portrait represents, it is a departure from Leonardo’s often captivating subjects, yet he managed to imbue the figure with the nobility and wisdom of a mature age. Based on stylistic evidence, many scholars consider the painting   in the Louvre the first of two paintings that Leonardo made of an apocryphal legend in which the Holy Family meets   as they flee to Egypt from  ’s Massacre of the Innocents. Leonardo was involved in years of litigation with the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, which commissioned the work, and the dispute eventually led Leonardo to paint another version of the subject about 1508, which is now housed in the National Gallery of London. The first painting shows the ways in which Leonardo ushered in the High  . Early paintings from this period often depicted figures in linear arrangements, separate from one another, and stiff in form. In  , however, the figures of the  , the Christ Child, the infant John, and an   are arranged in a pyramidal composition, and they not only convincingly occupy a space but interact with one another through gestures and glances. A youthful Mary sits on the ground in a mysterious rocky landscape, not on a throne as so many early Renaissance paintings depicted her. Her body has movement—it seems to sway as she tilts her head protectively toward the infant John, who kneels in prayer at the left, and she looks as if she nudges him over to the Christ Child at the right. Jesus, in turn, blesses John as an archangel, seen in a complex pose from the back, points toward John and glances inscrutably outward at the viewer. Leonardo also notably excluded traditional holy signifiers—  for Mary and Christ and a staff for John—so that the Holy Family appears less divine and more human. , a small brush drawing with pigment, depicts a young woman with her head tilted and her eyes downcast. Her posture recalls the Virgin Mary in Leonardo’s  , suggesting that the drawing may have served as a model. The drawing’s  ,  , translates to “disheveled” and refers to the young woman’s wayward strands of hair. The loosely sketched tendrils and shoulders contrast with the highly finished face, where Leonardo gently modeled the woman’s delicate features, from her heavy eyelids to her tender lips. It reveals Leonardo’s fluid means of working, utilizing both expressive drawing to create form and controlled layering to provide detail. Many art historians identify the youthful woman in   as Cecilia Gallerani, the mistress of Leonardo’s patron, Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan. The ermine was often used as an emblem for the duke. The woman turns her head to the right, her bright eyes seemingly directed toward something outside the frame. Although the painting has been heavily overpainted, notably the dark background, it nonetheless reveals Leonardo’s knowledge of anatomy and his ability to represent character in posture and expression. He captures the girl’s youth and genial nature in her guileless features, attentive gaze, and tender embrace of the ermine, which sits with its head cocked regally and alert. Her slender hand reveals the complicated bone structure beneath the skin, just as the head of the ermine suggests the skull underneath the finely rendered fur. The head-on portrait of   (c. 1500; “Savior of the World”) made headlines in 2017 when it sold for a record-breaking $450.3 million at auction. The high price was all the more surprising when considering that   was in poor condition, it had a questionable history, and its attribution was a   among scholars and critics. Many pundits remarked on the poor skill used to represent Jesus’ face; the stiff posture, which was so unlike the Renaissance master’s characteristic twisting poses; and the unconvincing representation of the glass globe, which, if solid, would have reflected a distorted view of its holder, an optical trick that Leonardo would have known about. Christie’s, the auction house that managed the sale, dismissed the criticisms, noting that any lack of craft was the result of heavy restoration in previous centuries and pointed to the soft modeling of Jesus’ right hand and the finesse of his tight curls, both characteristics that resembled Leonardo’s technique. The auction house also asserted that conservators had confirmed that the painting was made of the same materials that Leonardo would have used, notably  , an expensive high-quality blue pigment often reserved exclusively for virtuosos. The attribution debate continued well after the sale, but the interest in the work and the large sum paid at auction attested to Leonardo’s enduring celebrity and to his powerful position in the art history canon five centuries after his death. Housed in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the   is the only painting by Leonardo publicly displayed in the Western Hemisphere. It is one of Leonardo’s earliest works, finished when he was in his early 20s, and shows some of the unconventional methods he would use throughout his career. Inspired by his Northern contemporaries, Leonardo broke with tradition by depicting the solemn young woman in a three-quarter pose rather than the customary profile, and thus he may have been the first Italian artist to paint such a composition. He continued to use the three-quarter view in all of his portraits, including the  , and it quickly became the standard for portraiture, so ubiquitous that viewers take it for granted today. Leonardo may also have used his fingers when the paint was still tacky to model Ginevra’s face, as suggested by the fingerprints found in the paint surface. On the reverse side of the painting, a wreath of laurel and palm encircles a sprig of juniper (  in Italian—a pun on the sitter’s name), and a scroll bearing the Latin phrase “beauty adorns virtue” entwines each of the flora. The truncated appearance of the reverse side suggests that the painting may have been cut at the bottom, possibly because of damage from water or fire. Some scholars speculate that the portrait on the obverse would have included Ginevra’s hands and propose that a silverpoint study of arms and hands housed at   may have served as a preliminary drawing. Some scholars believe that   was Leonardo’s last painting, and in this work he used many of the conventions that he had established throughout his career to depict three generations of the Holy Family— , her daughter, the Virgin Mary, and the Christ Child. Anne, at the apex of the pyramidal composition, watches Mary, who sits on her lap, as the Virgin tenderly restrains the Christ Child from mounting a lamb. Contrasting with the knowing infant Leonardo depicted in  , the Christ figure in the   appears innocent, demonstrating playful juvenile behavior and showing a trusting expression as he returns his mother’s gaze. The interactions between the figures feels intimate and reveals Leonardo’s ability to represent convincing human relationships. The painting also shows Leonardo’s lifelong interest in believably representing three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. As in many of Leonardo’s paintings, the figures sit amid a fantastical landscape. Using  , a technique that he wrote about in his  , Leonardo created the illusion of distance by painting the rocky formations in the background so that they appear blue-gray and less detailed than the landscape of the foreground. He used this technique in many of the landscapes of his earlier works, including the   and  .

Through the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners. Our ad-supported Services and Games may also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this:  ) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers – doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.  Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc. and its group companies (‘LiveRamp’). IX and LiveRamp may use our first party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases in order to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising. These third parties may in turn link further demographic or interest-based information to your browser. You have the choice to opt-out of the use of your data by third-party service providers for this purpose at any time.  Please find more information about opting out  .

For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site’s visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads. Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. As described above, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services and Games, we work with third-party service providers, advertisers and advertising networks that use cookies and other similar technologies to target ads served to our free, ad-supported Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data that you provide directly to advertisers or third-party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser’s or third party partner’s privacy policy. What does it mean to “serve ads”? When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a “request” to the computer that hosts the website (the “host server”) requesting that server to send you (or “serve”) the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and advertising networks to whom we have sold the ad spaces. These advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (“targeting”). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the advertising network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as “behavioral advertising.” Britannica does not provide any personal information to third-party service providers, such as Raptive, advertisers or advertising networks about visitors to the Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that may have been collected from you by third parties on other websites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit  . Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at  . Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive a “opt-out” cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future.  . If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again.  more fully describes the cookies, beacons and other similar technology used on our Services for advertising purposes and provides information on when and how users can accept or reject them.

However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Services. For more information about cookies, please visit  .

When you visit a website in any browser, you automatically share information with that website, such as your IP address, and other standard PC information. If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider.  This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technological standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals.  If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services. If we discover that we have collected any personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 16 without the proper consents required by law, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible. Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Britannica has any information from or about anyone under 16, please email us at  . In general, if you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student service data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant. As you use the Institutional Services, you may enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we: However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of personally identifiable student data required for the setup of the system is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including personally identifiable student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization, which acknowledges that we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and that once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. That aggregated, non-personally identifiable data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties to provide products and do not share your student data with any third parties. Britannica is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure. Any personal information collected through the Services is stored on limited-access servers. We maintain a comprehensive information security program and seek to use commercially reasonable organizational, physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect these servers and the information they store from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss or modification. Our security measures include (among others): encryption of data; security controls that protect the entirety of Britannica’s IT infrastructure from external attack and unauthorized access; and internal policies setting out our data security approach and training for employees, including a Data Breach Notification Policy. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We strive to restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we strive to ensure that all our employees are aware of the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. If there is an unauthorized disclosure of personal information in Britannica’s possession or control, we will take steps in accordance with our written Incident Response Policy to investigate and mitigate the impact of the breach and notify affected customers in the manner required by applicable laws.

It was the first British parliamentary attempt to raise revenue through direct taxation on a wide variety of colonial transactions, including legal writs, newspaper advertisements, and ships’ bills of lading. Enraged colonists nullified the Stamp Act through outright refusal to use the stamps as well as by riots, stamp burning, and intimidation of colonial stamp distributors.  A series of four acts, the   were passed by the British Parliament in an attempt to assert what it considered to be its historic right to exert authority over the colonies through suspension of a recalcitrant representative assembly and through strict provisions for the collection of revenue duties. The acts were resisted everywhere with verbal agitation and physical violence, deliberate evasion of duties, renewed nonimportation agreements among merchants, and overt acts of hostility toward British enforcement agents, especially in Boston. In response, in October 1768, Parliament dispatched two regiments of the British army to Boston.  In Boston, a small British army detachment that was threatened by mob harassment opened fire and killed five people, an incident soon known as the  . The soldiers were charged with murder and were given a civilian trial, in which   conducted a successful defense.  Protesting both a tax on tea (taxation without representation) and the perceived monopoly of the  , a party of Bostonians thinly disguised as   people boarded ships at anchor and dumped some £10,000 worth of tea into the harbor, an event popularly known as the  .  In retaliation for colonial resistance to British rule during the winter of 1773–74, the British Parliament enacted four measures that became known as the  : the Boston Port Act, Massachusetts Government Act, Administration of Justice Act, and Quartering Act. Rather than intimidating Massachusetts and isolating it from the other colonies, the oppressive acts became the justification for convening the First Continental Congress later in 1774.  Called by the   in response to the Intolerable Acts, the First   convened in  . Fifty-six delegates represented all the colonies except Georgia. Convinced that war with Great Britain was inevitable, Virginian   defended strong resolutions for equipping the Virginia militia to fight against the British in a fiery speech in a Richmond church with the famous words, “I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”  On the night of April 18, 1775,     to   (both in Massachusetts) to warn that the British were marching from Boston to seize the colonial armory at  . En route, the British force of 700 men was met on Lexington Green by 77 local   and others. It is unclear who fired the first shot, but it sparked a skirmish that left eight Americans dead. At Concord, the British were met by hundreds of militiamen. Outnumbered and running low on ammunition, the British column was forced to retire to Boston. On the return march, American snipers took a deadly toll on the British. Total losses in the   numbered 273 British and more than 90 Americans. Breed’s Hill in   was the primary locus of combat in the misleadingly named  , which was part of the American  . Some 2,300 British troops eventually cleared the hill of the entrenched Americans, but at the cost of more than 40 percent of the assault force. The battle was a moral victory for the Americans.  In late 1775 the colonial conflict with the British still looked like a  , not a war aiming to separate nations; however, the publication of  ’s irreverent     abruptly put independence on the agenda. Paine’s 50-page pamphlet, couched in elegant direct language, sold more than 100,000 copies within a few months. More than any other single publication,   paved the way for the Declaration of Independence.  After the Congress recommended that colonies form their own governments, the   was written by   and revised in committee. On July 2 the Congress voted for independence; on   it adopted the Declaration of Independence. On September 21, 1776, having penetrated the British lines on   to obtain information, American Capt.   was captured by the British. He was hanged without trial the next day. Before his death, Hale is thought to have said, “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country,” a remark similar to one in the play   by  .  Having been   and driven across New Jersey by the British, George Washington and the Continental Army struck back on Christmas night by stealthily  , surprising the Hessian garrison at   at dawn, and taking some 900 prisoners. The American triumph at Trenton and in the Battle of Princeton (January 3, 1777) roused the new country and kept the struggle for independence alive.  Moving south from Canada in summer 1777, a British force under Gen.   captured Fort Ticonderoga (July 5) before losing decisively at Bennington, Vermont (August 16), and Bemis Heights, New York (October 7). His forces depleted, Burgoyne surrendered at Saratoga.  Following failures at the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown, Washington and 11,000 regulars took up winter quarters at  , 22 miles (35 km) northwest of British-occupied Philadelphia. Although its ranks were decimated by rampant disease, semi-starvation, and bitter cold, the reorganized Continental Army emerged the following June as a well-disciplined and efficient fighting force.  The French had secretly furnished financial and material aid to the Americans since 1776, but with the signing in Paris of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce and the Treaty of Alliance, the Franco-American alliance was formalized. France began preparing fleets and armies to enter the fight but did not formally declare war on Britain until June 1778.  The U.S. battleship the   was getting the worst of its battle with the British vessel HMS   off  , England, when the American commander,  , refused to surrender, proclaiming, “I have not yet begun to fight!” Jones ultimately triumphed, but he lost his ship in the process.  Having fought valiantly in a number of battles earlier in the war, American Gen.   conspired with the British to surrender the fort at West Point, New York, that he commanded. When  , the British army officer with whom Arnold had negotiated, was hanged as a spy after he was captured and the plot revealed, Arnold took sanctuary with the British.  The  , a plan of government organization that served as a bridge between the initial government by the Continental Congress and the federal government provided under the   of 1787, were written in 1776–77 and adopted by the Congress on November 15, 1777. However, the articles were not fully ratified by the states until March 1, 1781.  After winning a costly victory at Guilford Courthouse, North Carolina, on March 15, 1781,   entered Virginia to join other British forces there, setting up a base at Yorktown. Washington’s army and a force under the French   placed  , and Cornwallis surrendered his army of more than 7,000 men on October 19, 1781. After the British defeat at Yorktown, the land battles in America largely died out—but the fighting continued at sea, chiefly between the British and America’s European allies, which  . The military verdict in North America was reflected in the preliminary Anglo-American peace treaty of 1782, which was included in the  . By its terms, Britain recognized the independence of the United States with generous boundaries, including the Mississippi River on the west. Britain retained Canada but ceded East and West Florida to Spain.

A common distinction is that sensations are simple sensory experiences, while percepts are complex constructions of simple elements joined through association. Another is that perception is more subject to the influence of learning. Though hearing, smell, touch, and taste perceptions have all been explored, vision has received the most attention. Structuralist researchers such as Edward Bradford Titchener focused on the constituent elements of visual perceptions, whereas Gestalt psychology has stressed the need to examine organized wholes, believing humans are disposed to identifying patterns. Visual objects tend to appear stable despite continually changing stimulus features (such as ambient light, perspective, ground vs. figure arrangement), which enables an observer to match a perceived object with the object as it is understood to exist. Perceptions may be influenced by expectations, needs, unconscious ideas, values, and conflicts.

A number of     have been shown to be associated with creative productivity. One of these is autonomy: creative individuals tend to be independent and nonconformist in their thoughts and actions. Equally important is mastery of a particular domain—that is, a sphere of activity or   that requires a high level of ability. For example, in applying their knowledge of computers to the design of the Apple II, inventors   and   revolutionized the computer industry by appealing to individuals as well as businesses. French fashion designer   forever changed the way women dressed by designing simple yet stylish clothes. On the other hand, creative people may not have equally strong gifts across the spectrum of human ability. (A notable exception was  , whose achievements in the visual arts, mechanics, and engineering disclosed the talents of a creative polymath.) Some creative people show an interest in apparent disorder, contradiction, and imbalance—perhaps because they are challenged by asymmetry and  . Creative individuals may also exhibit a high degree of self-assurance. Some possess an exceptionally deep, broad, and flexible awareness of themselves. Others are shown to be   leaders with a great sensitivity to problems. The unconventionality of thought that is sometimes found in creative persons may be in part a resistance to  , which may be seen as demanding surrender of one’s unique fundamental nature. In fact, independence is critical to the creative process, in that creative people must often be able to work alone and must also be willing to express ideas or develop products that others might perceive as radical. It should be pointed out, however, that a nonconformist lifestyle is not essential to creativity; indeed, many creative individuals lead quite ordinary lives, expressing their   mainly in their unconventional ideas and work. Another trait common among creative people is that of introversion. While this does not imply a lack of social skills, it suggests that creative people tend to be reflective and inner-directed; they look to their own   rather than depending upon interaction with others to inform their attitudes and responses. A third crucial characteristic combines  curiosity and problem seeking. Creative individuals seem to have a need to seek novelty and an ability to pose unique questions. In   (1995), for example, the American psychologists   and Todd Lubart likened the combined traits of autonomy and   to buying low and selling high in the “marketplace of ideas.” By this they meant that the creative individual identifies a unique need—perhaps a problem or opportunity that no one else recognizes. This is the “buying low” phase, because it typically involves dismissing a popular solution and embracing an unheard-of solution or an   that has no  . When creative persons find a better solution, they then work toward “selling” others on the concept. This process can be seen in the work of inventors such as  , who designed a number of household and industrial devices,  , who designed text scanners and speech-recognition software, and  , whose numerous inventions include medical devices, water-purification systems, and the IBOT, a  . High   is common in creative persons, yet while they can meet the problems of life as rationally as anyone else can, their intellect does not rule at the expense of intuition or other seemingly nonrational influences. Most studies of the relationship of creativity to intelligence have also shown that extreme general intelligence does not necessarily kindle creativity. Findings such as these contributed to the “threshold” model of intelligence and creativity, which claims that, above a certain level, intelligence has little correlation with creativity—i.e., a highly intelligent person may not be as highly creative. It may be that intelligence sets the limits on the amount of information a person can learn and retain, while creative thinking provides the flexibility necessary for the original production of ideas. A distinction is sometimes made between  convergent thinking (the     measured by intelligence tests) and   (exemplified by a richness of ideas and originality of thought). Both seem necessary to creative performance, although the degree of each varies according to the task or occupation (i.e., a mathematician may exhibit more convergent than divergent thinking, while an artist would exhibit the reverse).  experiments in the fields of   and   have demonstrated the power of novelty as an inducement to action. This stems from the tension that exists between the regularity of daily life and interruptions that bring possibilities of new experience. Psychological studies of highly creative people have characterized this tension in terms of such dualities as intellect and  , the conscious and the  ,   and  , the conventional and the unconventional, and complexity and simplicity. Other qualities of creative individuals were identified by the American educational psychologist  E. Paul Torrance. They include fluency, or the ability to think of many ideas rapidly; flexibility, the capacity to use ideas and tools in unusual ways; and originality, the capacity to think of novel ideas and products. In 1966 Torrance and his colleagues developed a means of  , the  Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT), that accounts for all of these skills. The TTCT became one of the most widely used measures of creativity. Torrance provided additional support for his approach in follow-up studies of his subjects after 7, 12, and 22 years, and the passage of time has shown the TTCT to be among the more valid of all creativity tests.

Content: Strictly speaking, a   is someone who murders at least two people in separate events that occur at different times. While “serial murder” is not formalized by any legal code, the crimes of serial killers have often been seized on by the media and the public consciousness—especially in cases where there are many victims or the murders are carried out in gruesome fashion. The following list explores some of the most notorious serial killers the world has ever known.   We call him “ ,” but we don’t really know who the person behind one of the older and most notorious murder sprees was. The killer appeared in London’s Whitechapel district in 1888 and murdered five women—all prostitutes—and mutilated their corpses. Police surmised the killer was a surgeon, butcher, or someone skilled with a scalpel. The killer mocked the community and the police by sending letters outlining the acts. Although many suspects have been named over the years, the killer has never been identified.  started killing in 1978, just 18 years old, and wasn’t arrested for murder until 1991, after a would-be victim escaped and led police back to Dahmer’s Milwaukee, Wisconsin, home. It was there that some of the gruesome details of his life of killing were seen via photos of mutilated bodies and body parts strewn across the apartment. He even had a vat of acid he used to dispose of victims. In all, Dahmer killed 17 people, mostly young men of color. He served time in prison twice—the first time for molestation and the second time for murder—and was killed by a fellow inmate in 1994. Harold Shipman, also known as “ ,” is believed to have killed an estimated 250 patients. This doctor practiced in Greater Manchester, England, and between 1972 and 1998 he worked in two difference offices, killing all the while. He wasn’t caught until a red flag was raised by several people, including an undertaker who was surprised by the sheer number of cremation certificates Shipman was a part of, along with the fact that most of the cases were elderly women found to have died in bed not at night but rather during the day. Police mishandled the investigation, and Shipman kept killing until he got greedy and tried to concoct a will for a victim that named him beneficiary, which led the victim’s daughter to become suspicious. He was finally convicted in 2000 and committed suicide while in prison in 2004.  A construction worker known by his suburban neighbors as outgoing,   was involved in politics and even acted as a clown for birthday parties. He was no clown. Gacy came under suspicion in 1978 when a 15-year-old boy, last seen with him, went missing. That wasn’t the only time families of missing boys had pointed fingers at Gacy, but it was the first time authorities took them seriously. Soon after, a search warrant granted police access to the Gacy home, with the smell of nearly 30 bodies buried in a four-foot crawl space under his home. He was convicted of 33 counts of murder, with additional counts of rape and torture, and was executed by lethal injection in 1994.  Chicago has had its share of killers, but perhaps none more haunting than  , the pharmacist who turned a hotel into a torture castle. Ahead of the  , Holmes moved to Chicago and started outfitting a three-story hotel with all manner of nefarious contraptions, including gas lines, secret passages and trapdoors, hallways to dead ends, chutes to the basement, soundproofed padding, and torture devices strewn throughout a maze. The gas allowed Holmes to knock out his guests before the worst of what was to happen came next, often on his surgical tables. He then burned the bodies in the building’s furnace, selling skeletons to medical schools and running life insurance scams. In all, he copped to more than 30 murders—found only after a fellow scammer turned him in for falling short on a financial agreement—before he was hanged in 1896.  One of the world’s most prolific serial killers might still be out there. Pedro Lopez is linked to more than 300 murders in his native Colombia and in Ecuador and Peru. At least one-third of those murders were tribal women. After Lopez’s arrest in 1980, police found the graves of more than 50 of his preteen victims. He was later convicted of murdering 110 girls in Ecuador and confessed to 240 more murders in Colombia and Peru. The “Monster of the Andes” didn’t even spend 20 years in prison, as he was released in 1998 for good behavior. More than 20 years since, his whereabouts remain unknown.   loved the attention his murders garnered him, and many in the United States were more than happy to give him that attention. The western U.S. was his hunting ground, with an unknown number of murders piling up—mostly college-age women—from Washington and Oregon all the way to Utah and Colorado. Bundy was once arrested in Colorado and convicted of kidnapping, but he escaped custody, moving to Florida where he killed multiple times more. Bundy’s final arrest and its aftermath captured the attention of the nation, as the accused murderer acted as his own lawyer during what is believed to have been the first televised murder trial, welcomed interviews, and boasted of the fans he had created. He was eventually executed in an electric chair in 1989.

From the perspective of educators, critical     both a set of   skills that can be taught and a   toward reflective open inquiry that can be  . The term   was coined by American philosopher and educator   in the book   (1910) and was adopted by the progressive   movement as a core instructional goal that offered a   modern   to traditional educational methods such as rote memorization. Critical thinking is characterized by a broad set of related skills usually including the abilities to Theorists have noted that such skills are only valuable insofar as a person is inclined to use them. Consequently, they emphasize that certain habits of   are necessary components of critical thinking. This disposition may include curiosity, open-mindedness, self-awareness,  , and persistence. Although there is a generally accepted set of qualities that are associated with critical thinking, scholarly writing about the term has highlighted disagreements over its exact   and whether and how it differs from related concepts such as  . In addition, some theorists have insisted that critical thinking be regarded and valued as a process and not as a goal-oriented skill set to be used to solve problems. Critical-thinking theory has also been accused of reflecting patriarchal assumptions about knowledge and ways of knowing that are inherently   against women. Dewey, who also used the term  , connected critical thinking to a tradition of rational inquiry associated with modern  . From the turn of the 20th century, he and others working in the overlapping fields of  ,  , and educational theory sought to rigorously apply the   to understand and define the process of thinking. They conceived critical thinking to be related to the scientific method but more open, flexible, and self-correcting; instead of a recipe or a series of steps, critical thinking would be a wider set of skills, patterns, and strategies that allow someone to reason through an   topic, constantly reassessing assumptions and potential explanations in order to arrive at a sound judgment and understanding. In the   movement in the  , critical thinking was seen as a crucial component of raising citizens in a   society. Instead of imparting a particular series of lessons or   only   subject matter, theorists thought that teachers should train students in how to think. As critical thinkers, such students would be equipped to be productive and engaged citizens who could cooperate and rationally overcome differences   in a pluralistic society. Beginning in the 1970s and ’80s, critical thinking as a key outcome of school and   curriculum leapt to the forefront of U.S. education policy. In an atmosphere of renewed   competition and amid reports of declining U.S. test scores, there were growing fears that the quality of education in the United States was falling and that students were unprepared. In response, a concerted effort was made to systematically define curriculum goals and   standardized testing  , and critical-thinking skills were frequently included as a crucially important outcome of a successful education. A notable event in this movement was the release of the 1980 report of the Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities that called for the   to include critical thinking on its list of “basic skills.” Three years later the   system   a policy that required every undergraduate student to complete a course in critical thinking. Critical thinking continued to be put forward as a central goal of education in the early 21st century. Its ubiquity in the   of education policy and in such guidelines as the Common Core State Standards in the United States generated some   that the concept itself was both overused and ill-defined. In addition, an   was made by teachers, theorists, and others that educators were not being adequately trained to teach critical thinking.

Content: As you watch someone carelessly munching on an apple core, some vague alarm bells go off in your head. Didn't you hear somewhere that apple seeds are poisonous?     seeds (and the seeds of related plants, such as   and  ) contain amygdalin, a cyanogenic   composed of   and sugar. When metabolized in the  , this chemical degrades into highly poisonous   (HCN). A lethal dose of HCN can kill within minutes. Thankfully, there are several factors that make death-by-apple-seed very unlikely. First, the amygdalin is accessible only if the seeds have been crushed or chewed; a whole unbroken seed will pass right through. Second, the human body can process HCN in small doses, so a couple of chewed seeds are usually completely harmless. Finally, the average adult would need to eat anywhere from 150 to several thousand crushed seeds (depending on the apple variety) to be at risk of  . The average apple contains only about five to eight seeds. So unless someone is eating their 18th consecutive apple core and has been meticulously chewing all the seeds, they should be fine with their occasional absentminded core chomping.

Between 1968 and 1970 nearly 200 airplane   took place in Europe and the Middle East. The trend was continued throughout the ’70s by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a militant Marxist group that organized hijackings of a number of aircraft. The most notable, the hijacking of a French jet airliner en route from Israel to France, resulted in the  . When PFLP members held the plane’s 103 Israeli or Jewish passengers hostage for the release of 53 imprisoned militants, Israel responded by dispatching a commando squad; within an hour of the squad’s arrival in Entebbe, Uganda, the hostages had been freed and the seven PFLP militants had been killed.

Another devastation to the 1980s United States was the  : a significant increase in the use of crack cocaine, an affordable, highly addictive, and smokable form of cocaine. As President   intensified the U.S. government’s “ ,” defendants in federal crack cocaine cases (about 80 percent of whom were Black Americans, as of 2003) were penalized more harshly than defendants in cases involving other drugs, including  . “Mandatory minimum” prison sentences for drug offenses meant that possession of five grams of crack triggered an automatic five year sentence—while it took possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine to result in the same sentence.  was a self-proclaimed vigilante who was, in reality, a mass shooter: he shot four Black men who he claimed were planning to rob him on a New York City subway on December 22, 1984. By saying he acted in self-defense—even though there was no evidence that the men planned to rob him—Goetz was eventually found not guilty of attempted murder. He was convicted only of illegal weapons possession and served less than a year in prison. In July 1988 more than 70 syringes and vials of blood washed up on New York’s Staten Island beach. The cause was   at the area’s largest landfill: instead of following the proper procedures, workers were sending medical waste and other garbage out to sea. Following weeks of student-led protests in   and elsewhere in China demanding democratic reforms,   was declared in Beijing. When Chinese troops attempted to reach the square, they were initially thwarted by thousands of Beijing citizens blocking their way to protect the protesters. The military eventually broke through, however, and hundreds were killed and thousands wounded on the night of June 3–4, 1989. The conflict also produced one of the   of resistance to authoritarianism: an unidentified person now called   stopping a column of Chinese tanks.

For example, spectacles containing a wedge prism will bend light rays to displace images on the retina. An object thus will be seen as if it were somewhere other than its ordinarily perceived position. The subject’s initial attempts to touch the target will be misdirected, and there is a discrepancy between its location as seen and as felt.

A common distinction is that sensations are simple sensory experiences, while percepts are complex constructions of simple elements joined through association. Another is that perception is more subject to the influence of learning. Though hearing, smell, touch, and taste perceptions have all been explored, vision has received the most attention. Structuralist researchers such as Edward Bradford Titchener focused on the constituent elements of visual perceptions, whereas Gestalt psychology has stressed the need to examine organized wholes, believing humans are disposed to identifying patterns. Visual objects tend to appear stable despite continually changing stimulus features (such as ambient light, perspective, ground vs. figure arrangement), which enables an observer to match a perceived object with the object as it is understood to exist. Perceptions may be influenced by expectations, needs, unconscious ideas, values, and conflicts.

In one experiment Köhler placed a banana outside the cage of a hungry chimpanzee,  Sultan, and gave the animal two sticks, each too short for pulling in the food but joinable to make a single stick of sufficient length. Sultan tried unsuccessfully to use each stick, and he even used one stick to push the other along to touch the banana. Later, apparently after having given up, Sultan accidentally joined the sticks, observed the result, and immediately ran with the longer tool to retrieve the banana. When the experiment was repeated, Sultan joined the two sticks and solved the problem immediately. This result, however, is  , because it appeared that Sultan solved the problem by accident—not through insight.

Köhler’s doctoral   with   at the   (1909) was an investigation of hearing. As assistant and lecturer at the University of Frankfurt (1911), he continued his auditory research. In 1912 he and   were subjects for experiments on perception conducted by  , whose report on the experiments launched the   movement. Thereafter Köhler was associated with Wertheimer and Koffka as the three endeavoured to gain acceptance for the new theory. As director of the anthropoid research station of the Prussian Academy of Sciences at  ,   (1913–20), Köhler conducted experiments on problem-solving by  , revealing their ability to devise and use simple tools and build simple structures. His findings appeared in the classic   (1917;  ), a work that emphasized insight and led to a radical revision of  . Another major work,   (1920; “Physical   in Rest and Stationary States”), was based on an attempt to determine the relation of physical processes in nervous tissue to perception. In 1921 Köhler became head of the psychological institute and professor of philosophy at the University of Berlin, directing a series of investigations that explored many aspects of Gestalt theory and publishing   (1929). Outspoken in his   of   government, Köhler went to the   in 1935 and was professor of   at   in   until 1955.

Some higher animals, such as apes and cetaceans, have demonstrated more complex problem-solving abilities, including discrimination of abstract stimuli, rule learning, and application of language or languagelike operations. Humans use not only trial and error but also insight based on an understanding of principles,   and    , and   or   thinking. Problem-solving abilities and styles may vary considerably by individual.

Content:   One of the simplest instance of relational (or context) effects in perception is that of brightness contrast. Thus, the apparent brightness of a stimulus depends not only on its own luminance but also on that of the surrounding stimulation. The same gray square looks whiter against a dark background and blacker when placed in a bright surround. Similarly, a white or gray patch will take on an apparent hue that is complementary to the colour of the surround (e.g., the patch will seem tinged with yellow when it is placed against a blue background).  Analogous context effects are evident in  ...(100 of 9427 words)

For example, spectacles containing a wedge prism will bend light rays to displace images on the retina. An object thus will be seen as if it were somewhere other than its ordinarily perceived position. The subject’s initial attempts to touch the target will be misdirected, and there is a discrepancy between its location as seen and as felt. A right-angle prism will tilt the visual scene to any desired degree, altering the customary direction in which retinal images move. Usually, images of stationary objects  ...(100 of 9427 words)

Whatever their ultimate theoretical significance, these observations have been raised to the level of general principles. It is conventional to refer to them as Gestalt principles of perceptual organization.  The overriding theme of the theory is that stimulation is perceived in organized or configurational terms (  in German means “configuration”). Patterns take precedence over elements and have properties that are not inherent in the elements themselves. One does not merely perceive dots; he perceives a dotted line.

Content:   The most direct examination of perceptual learning is provided by investigating the effects of practice. In so-called detection tasks the observer is required to detect the presence or absence of a selected stimulus. For example, effects of practice on visual acuity were studied by requiring observers to detect simple orientation (left or right) in a row of leaning letters; e.g., . Practice tended to lower acuity thresholds, defined as the lowest intensity of illumination at which each observer could detect the orientation.

The procedure required that the introspecting experimental subjects learn to avoid reporting on their experiences as they naıvely seemed. To establish this way of treating experience required careful training. One consequence of this training is that the observer’s introspective reports may be contaminated by his expectations and hence may, in all honesty, reflect  ...(100 of 9427 words)

In general, if you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student service data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant. As you use the Institutional Services, you may enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we: However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of personally identifiable student data required for the setup of the system is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including personally identifiable student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization, which acknowledges that we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and that once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. That aggregated, non-personally identifiable data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties to provide products and do not share your student data with any third parties. Britannica is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure.

Insight occurs in human learning when people recognize relationships (or make novel   between objects or actions) that can help them solve new problems. Much of the scientific knowledge concerning insight derives from work on   that was conducted by 20th-century German   psychologist  . In one experiment Köhler placed a banana outside the cage of a hungry chimpanzee,  Sultan, and gave the animal two sticks, each too short for pulling in the food but joinable to make a single stick of sufficient length. Sultan tried unsuccessfully to use each stick, and he even used one stick to push the other along to touch the banana. Later, apparently after having given up, Sultan accidentally joined the sticks, observed the result, and immediately ran with the longer tool to retrieve the banana. When the experiment was repeated, Sultan joined the two sticks and solved the problem immediately. This result, however, is  , because it appeared that Sultan solved the problem by accident—not through insight.

A   is distinguished from an  , which is a misinterpretation of an actual  . A historical survey of the study of hallucinations reflects the development of scientific thought in  ,  , and  . By 1838 the significant relationship between the content of   and of hallucinations had been pointed out. In the 1840s the occurrence of hallucinations under a wide variety of conditions (including psychological and physical stress) as well as their genesis through the effects of such drugs as stramonium and   had been described. French physician  Alexandre-Jacques-François Brierre de Boismont in 1845 described many instances of hallucinations associated with intense concentration, or with musing, or simply occurring in the course of  . In the last half of the 19th century, studies of   continued. Investigators in France were particularly oriented toward abnormal psychological function, and from this came descriptions of hallucinosis during   and related reactions. In the 1880s English neurologist   described hallucination as being released or triggered by the  . Other definitions of the term emerged later. Swiss psychiatrist   (1857–1939) defined hallucinations as “perceptions without corresponding stimuli from without,” while the   in 1940 referred to hallucination as the “apparent perception of an external object when no such object is present.” A spirited interest in hallucinations continued well into the 20th century.  ’s concepts of conscious and unconscious activities added new significance to the content of dreams and hallucinations. It was theorized that   normally hallucinate the objects and processes that give them gratification. Although the notion has since been disputed, this “regression”   (i.e., that hallucinating is a regression, or return, to infantile ways) is still employed, especially by those who find it clinically useful. During the same period, others put forth theories that were more broadly biological than Freud’s but that had more points in common with Freud than with each other. The general theory of hallucinations here   rests upon two fundamental assumptions. One assumption states that life experiences influence the   in such a way as to leave, in the brain, enduring physical changes that have variously been called  ,  , or  . Ideas and images are held to derive from the incorporation and activation of these engrams in complex circuits involving nerve cells. Such circuits in the  cortex (outer layers) of the brain appear to subserve the neurophysiology of  ,  , imagination, and  . The emotions associated with these   and perceptual functions seem to be mediated through cortex connections with the deeper parts of the brain (the   or “visceral brain,” for example), thus permitting a   interplay between   and   through transactions that appear to take place largely at unconscious levels.  is found to be mediated by the     reticular activating system (a network of nerve cells in the  ). Analyses of hallucinations reported by sufferers of neurological disorders and by neurosurgical patients in whom the brain is stimulated electrically have shown the importance of the temporal lobes (at the sides of the brain) to auditory hallucinations, for example, and of other functionally relevant parts of the brain in this process. A second assumption states that the total human   is best understood in terms of the constant interplay of forces that continually emanate from inside (as internal physiological activity) and from outside the individual (as sensory stimuli). Such transactions between the   and the individual may be said to exert an   and organizing influence upon memory traces stored in the nervous system and to affect the patterns in which sensory engrams are activated to produce experiences called images, fantasies, dreams, or hallucinations, as well as the emotions associated with these patterns. If such a constantly shifting balance exists between internal and external environmental forces, physiological considerations (e.g., brain function) as well as cultural and experiential factors emerge as major determinants of the content and meaning of hallucinations. The brain is bombarded constantly by sensory impulses, but most of these are   from   in a dynamically shifting, selective fashion. The exclusion seems to be accomplished through the exercise of integrative inner mechanisms that focus one’s awareness on selected parts of potential experience. (The   of a ticking clock, for example, fades in and out of awareness.) Functioning simultaneously, these mechanisms survey information that is stored within the brain, select tiny samples needed to give adaptive significance to the incoming flow of information, and bring forth only a few items for actual recall from the brain’s extensive “memory banks.”

Whatever their ultimate theoretical significance, these observations have been raised to the level of general principles. It is conventional to refer to them as Gestalt principles of perceptual organization.  The overriding theme of the theory is that stimulation is perceived in organized or configurational terms (  in German means “configuration”). Patterns take precedence over elements and have properties that are not inherent in the elements themselves. One does not merely perceive dots; he perceives a dotted line.

To demonstrate empirically that sensing and perceiving are indeed different, however, is quite another matter. It is often said, for example, that sensations are simple and that percepts are complex. Yet, only if there is offered some agreed upon (a priori) basis for separating experiences into two categories—sensations and percepts—can experimental procedures demonstrate that the items in one category are “simpler” than those in the other.

(born January 21 [January 9, Old Style], 1887,  ,  ,   [now Tallinn, Estonia]—died June 11, 1967, Enfield,  , U.S.) was a German psychologist and a key figure in the development of  , which seeks to understand learning,  , and other components of mental life as structured wholes. Köhler’s doctoral   with   at the   (1909) was an investigation of hearing. As assistant and lecturer at the University of Frankfurt (1911), he continued his auditory research. In 1912 he and   were subjects for experiments on perception conducted by  , whose report on the experiments launched the   movement. Thereafter Köhler was associated with Wertheimer and Koffka as the three endeavoured to gain acceptance for the new theory. As director of the anthropoid research station of the Prussian Academy of Sciences at  ,   (1913–20), Köhler conducted experiments on problem-solving by  , revealing their ability to devise and use simple tools and build simple structures. His findings appeared in the classic   (1917;  ), a work that emphasized insight and led to a radical revision of  .

Some higher animals, such as apes and cetaceans, have demonstrated more complex problem-solving abilities, including discrimination of abstract stimuli, rule learning, and application of language or languagelike operations. Humans use not only trial and error but also insight based on an understanding of principles,   and    , and   or   thinking. Problem-solving abilities and styles may vary considerably by individual.

One primary element clearly is that of a succession of events, but distinguishable events are separated by more or less lengthy intervals that are called durations. Thus, sequence and duration are fundamental aspects of what is perceived in change. Manifestly, duration is relative to the events people isolate in the sequences through which they live: the duration of a kiss, of a meal, of a trip. A given interval always can be subdivided into a sequential chain delimiting briefer durations, as with the regular units that provide   measures of time: the second, the  , the  . Indeed, human experience is not simply that of one single series of events, but of a plurality of overlapping changes. The duration of a radio program, for example, can combine with that of a breakfast, both being inserted within the longer period of an ocean voyage. Humans seem to be unable to live without some concept of time. Ancient philosophies sought to relate the concept of time to some objective reality to which it would correspond.   (1596–1650) inaugurated a critical   of philosophy by stressing the ancient problem of the origin of ideas, including the   of time.   (1724–1804), providing a radical answer to the epistemological problem of time, wrote that we do not appreciate time objectively as a physical thing; that it is simply a pure form of sensible  . Other philosophers of the 18th and 19th centuries sought to explain the notion of time as arising from association and memory of successive perceptions. A move to empirical   emerged with the growth of research on the introspective data of experience. From about mid-19th century, under the influence of the psychophysical notions of  , psychologists conducted experiments to study the relationship between time as perceived and time as measured in  . Their work with adults gradually spread to the study of children and of animals. The psychologists then broadened their investigations of time to cover all forms of   to sequence and duration. One may respond to   in an immediate way (as in unconditioned reflex action) without taking the element of time into account. Stimulation, however, can also signal an event to follow; then it has meaning only as part of the sequence of which it is the first term: bell announcing dinner, a road sign, or an approaching danger. People react to such stimuli with anticipatory   that is adapted to a stimulus or action that has not yet occurred. The principles that govern such time-binding adaptation are none other than those of  . One event becomes conditioned as the signal for another   that is to be sought or avoided. The bottle-fed infant who initially reacts to the nipple on his lips with a simple sucking reflex is gradually conditioned to stop crying when he sees the bottle (the signal for feeding). Later he may learn to react to even more secondary signals that announce the arrival of the bottle;   being lifted from the crib or hearing the sounds of his mother warming the milk in the kitchen. His behaviour has come to incorporate the temporal dimension of the events. According to the principles of  , one stimulus becomes the signal for an ensuing event only if the second stimulus   an adaptive reaction (consummatory or aversive) and only if the order of the sequence is repeated. Conditioning tends to be established most rapidly when the interval between the signal (conditioned stimulus) and the unconditioned stimulus is quite brief.   estimated that the optimum interval for such a sequence was 0.5 second, which corresponds approximately to the intervals characteristic of sequences that are most accurately discriminable perceptually (see below  ). Aside from adapting the individual to the order of a sequence, conditioning also adapts to the duration between signal and immediately effective stimulus. Response to signal tends to occur after about the same interval that separated the two stimuli during conditioning. Thus, an animal may be trained to delay a response for some time after the signal (delayed conditioning). This form of adaptation is most   in  , permitting people to anticipate sequences of events in their   so that they can prepare to cope appropriately with what is yet to happen. In 1912 one of Pavlov’s students (I.P. Feokritova) demonstrated that a dog accustomed to being fed every 30 minutes would begin to drool toward the end of each half-hour period. It was clear evidence of conditioning to time; the between-feedings interval itself served as a conditioned stimulus. That discovery underscores the ever-present periodicity of daily living, especially on the   level: rhythms of activity and sleep, rhythms of eating and lovemaking. As conditioning intervenes, anticipatory experiences of hunger, fatigue, or arousal serve our adaptation to ecological demands. Allowance should also be made for the daily, or   in metabolic activity (  daily cycles of temperature change). There is evidence that these fundamental biological functions can synchronize with the rhythmic phases of environmental (exogenous) change. Thus within a few days after a factory worker has been assigned to the night shift, highs and lows of his daily fluctuations of temperature will be inversed. The rhythmic changes in body temperature persists, nevertheless, suggesting an innate (endogenous) basis for circadian phenomena. Such a   would mean that the gradual establishment of human circadian rhythms of sleep or temperature results from maturation of the   rather than from conditioning in the strict sense. Experiments begun in 1962, in which men lived in caves or other enclosures for months deprived of temporal cues from the environment, also demonstrated the enduring nature of rhythms in body temperature and in sleep–wakefulness. The rhythmic periods, however, sometimes expanded, the subject beginning to live on an approximately two-day cycle without being aware of it. Through conditioning to time and by way of circadian rhythms, human physiology provides a kind of biological   that offers points of reference for   orientation.

The procedure required that the introspecting experimental subjects learn to avoid reporting on their experiences as they naıvely seemed. To establish this way of treating experience required careful training. One consequence of this training is that the observer’s introspective reports may be contaminated by his expectations and hence may, in all honesty, reflect  ...(100 of 9427 words)

For example, a dog conditioned to salivate to a tone of a particular pitch and loudness will also salivate with considerable regularity in response to tones of higher and lower pitch. The generalized response is predictable and orderly: it will measure less than that elicited by the original tone and will diminish as the new tone departs increasingly from the original. Similar behaviour is observed in humans, as children learning to talk may call anything that can be sat upon “chair” or any man “daddy.” Adults conditioned by mild electric shock to fear a certain word will respond with symptoms of anxiety to any synonym of that word; in this instance, physical similarity, the usual basis of generalization, is less important than prior learning. Responses may also be generalized, allowing an individual to take an alternative course of action if the usual response is for some reason precluded. Learning may be considered a balance of generalization and discrimination (the ability to respond to differences among stimuli). An imbalance can lead to negative results. For example, a child who is scared by a man with a beard may fail to discriminate between bearded men and generalize that all men with beards are to be feared.

Space perception provides cues, such as depth and distance, that are important for movement and orientation to the  . Human beings have been interested in the   of objects in space at least since antiquity. It was popularly thought in   that objects could be seen because they emitted what was imagined to be a continuous series of extremely thin “membranes” in their own image; these fell upon the eye and merged into the picture that was perceived. Centuries of experimental research led to a more tenable   in which space was described in terms of three   or planes: height (vertical plane), width (horizontal plane), and depth (sagittal plane). These planes all intersect at right angles, and their single axis of intersection is defined as being located within perceived three-dimensional space—that is, in the “eye” of the perceiving individual. Humans do not ordinarily perceive a binocular space (a separate visual world from each eye) but instead see a so-called  , as if the images from each eye fuse to produce a single visual field akin to that of Cyclops, a one-eyed giant in  . The horizontal, vertical, and sagittal planes divide space into various sectors: something is perceived as “above” or “below” (the horizontal plane), as “in front of” or “behind” (the vertical plane), or as “to the right” or “to the left” (of the sagittal plane). An early theory put forth by the Anglican bishop   at the beginning of the 18th century was that the third dimension (depth) cannot be directly perceived by the eyes because the retinal image of any object is two-dimensional, as in a painting. He held that the ability to have visual experiences of depth is not inborn but can result only from logical deduction based on   learning through the use of other senses such as touch. Although modern research fails to verify Berkeley’s emphasis on reason as central to perception, contemporary theories still include both nativistic (inborn) and empirical (learned through experience) considerations. The study of   developed rapidly in the second half of the 19th century and still more rapidly during the 20th. Many psychologists who deal with perceptual function hold that the study of space perception is rapidly becoming a distinct branch of   in its own right. This special field within psychology concentrates on the factors contributing to the perceived organization of objects in space (e.g., on cues to depth perception, movement, form, colour, and their interactions) or dwells on particularly interesting special problems such as that of  amodal perception (e.g., the question of how one perceives that there are six sides to a cube, even though only three of them can be seen at a single time). Space perception research also offers insight into ways that perceptual   helps orient the individual to the environment. Specifically, orientation in space typically seems to reflect one’s strivings (e.g., to seek food or to avoid injury). People could not orient themselves to their  , however, unless the environmental information reaching them through the various sense organs offered a perception of space that corresponds to their physical “reality.” Such perception is called  veridical perception—the direct perception of stimuli as they exist. Without some degree of veridicality concerning physical space, one cannot seek food, flee from enemies, or even socialize. Veridical perception also causes a person to experience changing stimuli as if they were stable: even though the sensory image of an approaching tiger grows larger, for example, one tends to perceive that the animal’s size remains unchanged. In other words, one perceives objects in the environment as having relatively constant   (as to size, colour, and so on) despite considerable variations in stimulus conditions. Not all perception of space, however, is veridical; instead, perception may fail to correspond to reality—often in some systematic way. These are cases of nonveridical perception. Experiments have shown that the three basic spatial planes (horizontal, vertical, and sagittal) dominate the ability of the individual to localize visual objects in nearby space. Often, objects can be perceived as   closer to these basic dimensions or planes than they really are. (Part of the explanation of these perceptual discrepancies in visual experience may lie in the force of  .) Nonveridical perceptions do not generate   in one’s perception of space. Instead, they clarify the perceived characteristics of surrounding space. If all of the mass of sensory information available at a given moment were perceived veridically, the flood of data might confuse the perceiver to the point of disorientation. In other words, some degree of selectivity in perception appears to guide the survival of the individual. Ideally, information about the environment is perceived only as it is relevant to the goals, needs, or physiological state of the individual at a given moment.

Content: In June 1946 an airplane traveled from Rome to Paris, crossing over the Mediterranean Sea. There was nothing unusual about this flight except one thing: for 20 minutes of the plane’s journey, one of its passengers became its pilot. The passenger was Dr.  , an American author, educator, and activist who since childhood had been both  . Though many women of her generation would rarely—or never—travel via airplane, this was not Keller’s first time in the air. Her first flight as a passenger took place in 1919 on the set of  , a biographical film about her life in which she actually appeared. Though Keller had been known across the United States by the time she was 16 and internationally by the time she was 24, some of the public still doubted that a blind and deaf person could successfully communicate with hearing people or graduate from college—both of which Keller had already achieved. To combat this skepticism,  ’s producers wanted, as they explained, “to show her doing all those things that [able-bodied] people do,” including “scenes in which she dresses herself, just to show the public that she can, and in which she sleeps, to prove to the curious that she closes her eyes.” And since the  , still a new technology at that time, was all the rage, the producers decided they should show Keller flying too. Though Keller knew the inclusion of the scene in an allegedly biographical feature was absurd (and she frequently quarrelled with the production team when she found their script unrealistic), she was thrilled to have the opportunity to fly. A   narrated the event, possibly as promotion for the film:  As flight technology improved, Keller found more opportunities to feel that physical freedom. In 1931 she was a passenger on an extended flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Washington, D.C., a 200-mile (322-km) journey that culminated in a meeting with the  .   covered the flight, reporting that Keller likened the plane to “a great graceful bird sailing through the illimitable skies.” And that brings us back to 1946: the year Helen Keller piloted a plane herself.  Keller and her companion Polly Thomson, who translated Keller’s speech to others and spoke to Keller by pressing symbols into her hand, were traveling to Europe (and, later, India, Africa, and the Middle East) on behalf of the  . When the small plane crossed the Mediterranean, Keller took over the pilot’s controls. Later she would   “by the same means as she piloted the ’plane, through hand ‘talk’ between herself and [Thomson].” Thomson signed to Keller the pilot’s instructions as, in the copilot’s seat, Keller took over. “The ’plane crew were amazed at her sensitive touch on the controls,” Thomson said. “There was no shaking or vibration. She just sat there and flew the ’plane calmly and steadily.” As pilot, Keller felt “the delicate movement” of the airplane better than ever before. Though news coverage treated the flight as miraculous, Keller isn’t the only deaf-blind person to fly a plane. For example, in 2012, 15-year-old Katie Inman (who, like Keller, primarily used tactile sign language to communicate)   in Florida. A flight instructor assisted her through the takeoff and landing, handing over the controls when the plane leveled out at 2,600 feet (about 792 meters).  Skepticism regarding the capability of deaf-blind people     in Keller’s lifetime. Still, her reputation as a writer, communicator, and activist (and one-time pilot) helped remove the social stigma surrounding blindness, which at the beginning of her career was often associated with  . Before Keller, blindness was a taboo topic for women’s magazines; when she became a public figure, even the   published her writing on blindness and disability. With Keller writing books, lecturing, and flying a plane, public ignorance regarding the deaf-blind could no longer be left unacknowledged.

After receiving a Ph.D. in psychology at   in 1928, Gibson joined the faculty of  . He married   (née Jack)—who would become a prominent psychologist in her own right—in 1932. During   he served in the Army Air Forces (1942–46), where he did research on visual aircraft identification and on increasing the effectiveness of training films, among other topics. After the war he returned to Smith College before moving to   in 1949. He retired in 1972. Gibson developed what he called an “ecological approach” to the study of visual perception, according to which humans perceive their   directly, without mediation by   processes or by mental entities such as  . Perceiving a tree, for example, does not consist of constructing a mental image of a tree from stimuli (light energy) entering the visual system and then attributing the visual properties of the image to the tree itself. Instead, one directly sees the visual properties of the tree. This idea was radical because it contradicted a centuries-old model of the origins of human knowledge. As Gibson himself put it, “The old idea that sensory inputs are converted into perceptions by operations of the   is rejected.” Gibson created a highly influential theory of “ affordances,” which are qualities of an object or   that communicate opportunities to do certain things (e.g., dark shade indicates an opportunity to get out of the sunshine; a thick cushion signals the availability of comfortable seating). According to Gibson, affordances exist naturally and are directly perceived by the viewer. His work had a large impact in  , or  , which is partly concerned with the perceived affordances in products designed for human use. In addition to   (1979), Gibson’s most important writings include   (1950) and    (1966). His followers organized the International Society for Ecological Psychology in 1981.

He took a leave of absence, and, after intensive study and experimentation, succeeded (1932) in aligning submicroscopic crystals of iodoquinine sulfate and embedding them in a sheet of plastic. The resulting polarizer, for which he   numerous uses and which he dubbed Polaroid J sheet, was a tremendous advance. It allowed the use of almost any size of polarizer and significantly reduced the cost. With George Wheelwright III, a Harvard   instructor, Land founded the  ,  , in 1932. He developed and, in 1936, began to use numerous types of Polaroid material in sunglasses and other optical devices. Polaroid was later used in camera filters and other optical equipment. Land founded the Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, Mass., in 1937. Four years later he developed a widely used, three-dimensional motion-picture process based on polarized light. During   he applied the polarizing principle to various types of military equipment. Land began work on an instantaneous developing film after the war. In 1947 he demonstrated a camera (known as the  ) that produced a finished print in 60 seconds. The Land photographic process soon found numerous commercial, military, and scientific applications. Many   were made in the following years, including the development of a colour process. Land’s Polaroid Land cameras, which were able to produce developed photographs within one minute after the exposure, became some of the most popular cameras in the world. Land’s interest in light and colour resulted in a new theory of  . In a series of experiments he revealed certain conflicts in the classical theory of colour perception. He found that the colour perceived is not dependent on the relative amounts of blue, green, and red light entering the eye; he proposed that at least three independent image-forming mechanisms, which he called retinexes, are sensitive to different colours and work in   to indicate the colour seen. Land received more than 500 patents for his innovations in light and plastics. In 1980 he retired as   of Polaroid but remained active in the field of light and colour research by working with the  , a nonprofit centre supported by the Rowland Foundation, Inc., a corporation that Land founded in 1960. Under Land’s direction, Rowland researchers discovered that perception of light and colour is regulated essentially by the brain, rather than through a spectrum system in the retina of the eye, as was previously believed.

For example, a dog conditioned to salivate to a tone of a particular pitch and loudness will also salivate with considerable regularity in response to tones of higher and lower pitch. The generalized response is predictable and orderly: it will measure less than that elicited by the original tone and will diminish as the new tone departs increasingly from the original. Similar behaviour is observed in humans, as children learning to talk may call anything that can be sat upon “chair” or any man “daddy.” Adults conditioned by mild electric shock to fear a certain word will respond with symptoms of anxiety to any synonym of that word; in this instance, physical similarity, the usual basis of generalization, is less important than prior learning. Responses may also be generalized, allowing an individual to take an alternative course of action if the usual response is for some reason precluded. Learning may be considered a balance of generalization and discrimination (the ability to respond to differences among stimuli). An imbalance can lead to negative results. For example, a child who is scared by a man with a beard may fail to discriminate between bearded men and generalize that all men with beards are to be feared.

Surgical abortion performed later in pregnancy (after 12-16 weeks) is called D&E (dilation and evacuation). The second most common abortion procedure, a medical abortion (aka an “abortion pill”), involves taking medications, usually mifepristone and misoprostol (aka RU-486), within the first seven to nine weeks of pregnancy to induce an abortion. The   (CDC) found that 67% of abortions performed in 2014 were performed at or less than eight weeks’ gestation, and 91.5% were performed at or less than 13 weeks’ gestation. 77.3% were performed by surgical procedure, while 22.6% were medical abortions. An abortion can cost from $500 to over $1,000 depending on where it is performed and how long into the pregnancy it is.

A   is distinguished from an  , which is a misinterpretation of an actual  . A historical survey of the study of hallucinations reflects the development of scientific thought in  ,  , and  . By 1838 the significant relationship between the content of   and of hallucinations had been pointed out. In the 1840s the occurrence of hallucinations under a wide variety of conditions (including psychological and physical stress) as well as their genesis through the effects of such drugs as stramonium and   had been described. French physician  Alexandre-Jacques-François Brierre de Boismont in 1845 described many instances of hallucinations associated with intense concentration, or with musing, or simply occurring in the course of  . In the last half of the 19th century, studies of   continued. Investigators in France were particularly oriented toward abnormal psychological function, and from this came descriptions of hallucinosis during   and related reactions. In the 1880s English neurologist   described hallucination as being released or triggered by the  . Other definitions of the term emerged later. Swiss psychiatrist   (1857–1939) defined hallucinations as “perceptions without corresponding stimuli from without,” while the   in 1940 referred to hallucination as the “apparent perception of an external object when no such object is present.” A spirited interest in hallucinations continued well into the 20th century.  ’s concepts of conscious and unconscious activities added new significance to the content of dreams and hallucinations. It was theorized that   normally hallucinate the objects and processes that give them gratification. Although the notion has since been disputed, this “regression”   (i.e., that hallucinating is a regression, or return, to infantile ways) is still employed, especially by those who find it clinically useful. During the same period, others put forth theories that were more broadly biological than Freud’s but that had more points in common with Freud than with each other. The general theory of hallucinations here   rests upon two fundamental assumptions. One assumption states that life experiences influence the   in such a way as to leave, in the brain, enduring physical changes that have variously been called  ,  , or  . Ideas and images are held to derive from the incorporation and activation of these engrams in complex circuits involving nerve cells. Such circuits in the  cortex (outer layers) of the brain appear to subserve the neurophysiology of  ,  , imagination, and  . The emotions associated with these   and perceptual functions seem to be mediated through cortex connections with the deeper parts of the brain (the   or “visceral brain,” for example), thus permitting a   interplay between   and   through transactions that appear to take place largely at unconscious levels.  is found to be mediated by the     reticular activating system (a network of nerve cells in the  ). Analyses of hallucinations reported by sufferers of neurological disorders and by neurosurgical patients in whom the brain is stimulated electrically have shown the importance of the temporal lobes (at the sides of the brain) to auditory hallucinations, for example, and of other functionally relevant parts of the brain in this process. A second assumption states that the total human   is best understood in terms of the constant interplay of forces that continually emanate from inside (as internal physiological activity) and from outside the individual (as sensory stimuli). Such transactions between the   and the individual may be said to exert an   and organizing influence upon memory traces stored in the nervous system and to affect the patterns in which sensory engrams are activated to produce experiences called images, fantasies, dreams, or hallucinations, as well as the emotions associated with these patterns. If such a constantly shifting balance exists between internal and external environmental forces, physiological considerations (e.g., brain function) as well as cultural and experiential factors emerge as major determinants of the content and meaning of hallucinations. The brain is bombarded constantly by sensory impulses, but most of these are   from   in a dynamically shifting, selective fashion. The exclusion seems to be accomplished through the exercise of integrative inner mechanisms that focus one’s awareness on selected parts of potential experience. (The   of a ticking clock, for example, fades in and out of awareness.) Functioning simultaneously, these mechanisms survey information that is stored within the brain, select tiny samples needed to give adaptive significance to the incoming flow of information, and bring forth only a few items for actual recall from the brain’s extensive “memory banks.”

Content: Vaquitas, the rarest and smallest of all   (members of a certain order of aquatic mammals), inhabit only the waters in Mexico’s Gulf of California. There were nearly 600 vaquitas in 1997, but estimates of how many survive as of 2022 range from just 10 to 18 of the  . The vaquita’s natural range is rich in fish and shrimp, and therefore it is also rich in fishing boats. The gill nets used by the locals are meant to capture the totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder can fetch $20,000 each in China, where it’s viewed as a delicacy. The average vaquita is 4.9 feet long, which makes it similar in size to the totoaba. This is problematic because vaquitas can become entangled in these nets and drown. Gill nets were banned by the Mexican government in 2015 but are still used illegally, despite social programs and restrictions intended to deter their use. William Blake’s “forests of the night,” the stalking grounds of the six subspecies of  , are burning bright. Slash-and-burn agriculture along with logging and human encroachment have hugely diminished the habitat available to these felines, which require extensive ranges capable of supporting the large herbivores that constitute the bulk of their diet. Poaching—for trophies and body parts used in Asian “medicine”—is thought to pose the greatest threat to tigers. An estimated 4,500 tigers are left in the wild. In 2014 China explicitly outlawed the consumption of endangered species, including tigers, whose bones, penises, and other organs are superstitiously believed to have magical curative powers. In 1938, the first year a population survey was conducted, only 29   remained in the wild. Three years later only 16 were left. Hunting and reduction of their wetland habitat had decimated the population, and concerted efforts to salvage remnant birds did not begin until the late 1960s. In 2022 it was estimated that there were more than 500 birds, thanks in large part to innovative breeding programs. Though a plan that involved transferring whooping crane eggs to the nests of related sandhill cranes for fostering ultimately failed, captive rearing and reintroduction have established two wild populations in Florida, one of which has been taught to migrate to Wisconsin. Neither is self-sustaining. The only self-sustaining population migrates between Alberta, Canada, and Texas, U.S. Fewer than 25,000  , the largest animals on the planet, survive today. Comprising several subspecies, blue whales are found in all of the world’s oceans save the Arctic. The current population is thought to have been reduced by up to 90 percent by whaling in the 20th century. Commercial hunting of the species was ultimately banned in 1966. The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service spelled out a recovery plan in 1998. It stipulated the maintenance of photo databases of individual specimens and the collection of genetic and migration data in order to better understand the species, which remains at risk from ship collisions and entanglement in fishing nets. The   estimates that the current population of Asian  , which inhabit 13 countries, is about 40,000–50,000. That number may be far lower; some regions inhabited by the lumbering pachyderms are inaccessible because of the terrain or political volatility. Over 50 percent of the population is concentrated in India. The burgeoning human population there—and elsewhere in Asia—creates conflicts for space and resources. And, while the tusks of Asian elephants are much smaller than those of their African counterparts, the Asian species is still poached for its ivory, meat, and skin. The luxurious waterproof coat that insulates   from the chilly waters they inhabit almost led to their extinction. A target of the commercial fur trade, the species was almost wiped out, its population reduced from an estimated 300,000 in the early 1700s to some 2,000 by 1911. That year an international ban on commercial hunting was enacted. That ban and management and conservation measures taken in the wake of the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act have helped populations recover to perhaps 128,000 worldwide by the early 21st century. Still, sea otters are highly vulnerable to both natural phenomena such as killer whale predation and to anthropogenic factors such as oil spills. At first glance, the  ’s fleshy folds of skin appear to be plated armor, complementing the keratinous horn adorning the skull of this lumbering species. Its population faces many threats: natural disasters, habitat loss, disease, and, notably, poaching for its horn. In 2010 the last of continental Asia’s Javan rhinoceroses was killed in Vietnam. Today the Javan rhinoceros inhabits Ujung Kulon National Park, which sits on a remote peninsula on the eastern side of the Indonesian island of Java. Historically, the single-horned beasts were found across wide swaths of South Asia and Southeast Asia too. The   is nearly extinct, and the Javan rhino, whose population numbers no more than 75 individuals of all ages, appears to be treading a similar path. Depending on whom you ask, there are either two species of  , the eastern ( ) and western ( ), or three subspecies, the eastern lowland, western lowland, and mountain gorillas. Regardless of whom you ask, all gorillas are endangered. There could be more than 300,000 gorillas left in the wild, and they’re listed as critically endangered. Habitat encroachment and poaching for bushmeat, trophies, and supposed magical talismans have led to substantial losses. Because their social structure is so complex and because they reproduce slowly—females giving birth only once every four years at best—the removal of even a few individuals from a gorilla troop can catastrophically impact its ability to sustain itself. Between 1996 and 2008 the population of   dropped some 60 percent because of a contagious cancer known as devil facial tumor disease. It continues to decimate populations of the species, which occurs only on the Australian island of Tasmania. There may be only 10,000 wild individuals remaining. Captive breeding of uninfected individuals has been instituted, and efforts have been made to develop a vaccine for the cancer, which is thought to have stemmed from mutated cells from a single specimen. Orangutan is Malaysian for “person of the forest.” Though morphologically   may resemble melted Muppets more than people, their sophisticated cognitive abilities are very human indeed. Like gorillas and chimpanzees, they have been known to use tools. Threatened largely by logging and capture for the exotic pet trade, orangutans—restricted to the Southeast Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra—number about 120,000 per the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. A 2011 survey revealed that more than 50 percent of the original Bornean orangutan population had been killed in the previous 40 years. Unlike other great apes, orangutans are usually solitary or live in groups of fewer than three, making them difficult to track and study.

Content: The   is one of the most iconic sculptures in the Western world and is often seen as a symbol of American freedom. Designed and sculpted by French sculptor  , France donated this colossal statue to the United States in 1875 to commemorate their alliance during the  . Formally titled  , the statue depicts a crowned Liberty, personified as a woman, lifting up a torch with her right hand as her left hand clutches a tablet bearing “JULY IV, MDCCLXXVI,” the Roman-numeral date on which the   was adopted. In “The New Colossus,” Emma Lazarus calls her the “Mother of Exiles,” and for Americans new and old, her image has become one of the most recognizable in the world. But what do we know about the real-life woman who inspired Lady Liberty? Answering this question requires going back in Bartholdi’s writings and sketches—not of the Statue of Liberty but of an earlier statue that bears a stark resemblance to his American monument. Bartholdi began to dabble in colossal statuary in the late 1850s, nearly 30 years before the Statue of Liberty was completed. He   as having been informed by classical monuments, like the  . The style he studied “with the greatest attention,” however, was that of the ancient Egyptians. Bartholdi journeyed to Egypt about 1856 and was awestruck at the  , two statues of the pharaoh  . At 70 feet (21 meters) tall, they had towered over the ruins of ancient Thebes for over 3,200 years. Bartholdi wrote that “these granite beings, in their imperturbable majesty, seem to be still listening to the most remote antiquity. Their kindly and impassable glance seems to ignore the present and to be fixed upon an unlimited future….[T]he design itself expresses, after a fashion, infinity.” Bartholdi’s journey to Egypt was enormously transformative and influential. In 1868 he returned to marvel again at the Colossi, and in 1869 Bartholdi submitted a colossal statuary proposal to the Egyptian  ,  . Bartholdi hoped that the khedive would use his sculpture design to commemorate the completion of the  , which had opened that year. As the shortest path between the Mediterranean and Red Seas, the Suez Canal functioned as a literal sea-bridge between Europe and Asia. If selected, Bartholdi hoped that his colossus would be seen as a symbol of cultural progress and understanding.  for the khedive was modeled after a woman  , or Egyptian peasant. Unfortunately, very little is known about this   besides her socioeconomic status; Bartholdi left no records that indicate any interest in her personal story. Despite this, selecting a woman was no accident. Bartholdi was conscious of a centuries-long European artistic tradition of personifying values, ideas, and even countries in the forms of women. These personifications were venerated and sometimes worshipped, but of particular importance for Bartholdi was that they lived and lingered in the minds of those who viewed their likenesses. This logic is clear in the name, form, and function of Bartholdi’s contest submission. Titled  , this colossal woman was to be positioned in the middle of the Suez Canal atop a monumental plinth. Dressed in what Egyptians would have recognized as the clothes of a   and immortalized as a monument, she would have been a point of pride for Egyptians of all social classes. She doubled as a lighthouse, holding a torch up high and radiating light from her head. As ships from countless nations passed beneath her, this woman was to be seen as the physical embodiment of Egypt and its progress. Although Bartholdi’s submission may have impressed the khedive, building the colossus would have been enormously expensive. Egypt was facing financial problems that likely caused the khedive to shift his attention elsewhere, and the project was terminated. But if Bartholdi’s colossal   seems recognizable, that is because he was determined to repurpose his scrapped design. Between 1870 and 1871, he began to alter the details of his sketches. The woman’s characteristic Egyptian dress gave way to Greek robes, and light beamed from her torch instead of her head. A diadem would later replace her head covering, while her left hand soon bore a tablet. But like the sketches from 1869, she still held her torch with an upstretched arm, her other limb positioned at her waist. Beneath what would become America’s   was Egypt’s own colossal  , still “carrying the light.”

One primary element clearly is that of a succession of events, but distinguishable events are separated by more or less lengthy intervals that are called durations. Thus, sequence and duration are fundamental aspects of what is perceived in change. Manifestly, duration is relative to the events people isolate in the sequences through which they live: the duration of a kiss, of a meal, of a trip. A given interval always can be subdivided into a sequential chain delimiting briefer durations, as with the regular units that provide   measures of time: the second, the  , the  . Indeed, human experience is not simply that of one single series of events, but of a plurality of overlapping changes. The duration of a radio program, for example, can combine with that of a breakfast, both being inserted within the longer period of an ocean voyage. Humans seem to be unable to live without some concept of time. Ancient philosophies sought to relate the concept of time to some objective reality to which it would correspond.   (1596–1650) inaugurated a critical   of philosophy by stressing the ancient problem of the origin of ideas, including the   of time.   (1724–1804), providing a radical answer to the epistemological problem of time, wrote that we do not appreciate time objectively as a physical thing; that it is simply a pure form of sensible  . Other philosophers of the 18th and 19th centuries sought to explain the notion of time as arising from association and memory of successive perceptions. A move to empirical   emerged with the growth of research on the introspective data of experience. From about mid-19th century, under the influence of the psychophysical notions of  , psychologists conducted experiments to study the relationship between time as perceived and time as measured in  . Their work with adults gradually spread to the study of children and of animals. The psychologists then broadened their investigations of time to cover all forms of   to sequence and duration. One may respond to   in an immediate way (as in unconditioned reflex action) without taking the element of time into account. Stimulation, however, can also signal an event to follow; then it has meaning only as part of the sequence of which it is the first term: bell announcing dinner, a road sign, or an approaching danger. People react to such stimuli with anticipatory   that is adapted to a stimulus or action that has not yet occurred. The principles that govern such time-binding adaptation are none other than those of  . One event becomes conditioned as the signal for another   that is to be sought or avoided. The bottle-fed infant who initially reacts to the nipple on his lips with a simple sucking reflex is gradually conditioned to stop crying when he sees the bottle (the signal for feeding). Later he may learn to react to even more secondary signals that announce the arrival of the bottle;   being lifted from the crib or hearing the sounds of his mother warming the milk in the kitchen. His behaviour has come to incorporate the temporal dimension of the events. According to the principles of  , one stimulus becomes the signal for an ensuing event only if the second stimulus   an adaptive reaction (consummatory or aversive) and only if the order of the sequence is repeated. Conditioning tends to be established most rapidly when the interval between the signal (conditioned stimulus) and the unconditioned stimulus is quite brief.   estimated that the optimum interval for such a sequence was 0.5 second, which corresponds approximately to the intervals characteristic of sequences that are most accurately discriminable perceptually (see below  ). Aside from adapting the individual to the order of a sequence, conditioning also adapts to the duration between signal and immediately effective stimulus. Response to signal tends to occur after about the same interval that separated the two stimuli during conditioning. Thus, an animal may be trained to delay a response for some time after the signal (delayed conditioning). This form of adaptation is most   in  , permitting people to anticipate sequences of events in their   so that they can prepare to cope appropriately with what is yet to happen. In 1912 one of Pavlov’s students (I.P. Feokritova) demonstrated that a dog accustomed to being fed every 30 minutes would begin to drool toward the end of each half-hour period. It was clear evidence of conditioning to time; the between-feedings interval itself served as a conditioned stimulus. That discovery underscores the ever-present periodicity of daily living, especially on the   level: rhythms of activity and sleep, rhythms of eating and lovemaking. As conditioning intervenes, anticipatory experiences of hunger, fatigue, or arousal serve our adaptation to ecological demands. Allowance should also be made for the daily, or   in metabolic activity (  daily cycles of temperature change). There is evidence that these fundamental biological functions can synchronize with the rhythmic phases of environmental (exogenous) change. Thus within a few days after a factory worker has been assigned to the night shift, highs and lows of his daily fluctuations of temperature will be inversed. The rhythmic changes in body temperature persists, nevertheless, suggesting an innate (endogenous) basis for circadian phenomena. Such a   would mean that the gradual establishment of human circadian rhythms of sleep or temperature results from maturation of the   rather than from conditioning in the strict sense. Experiments begun in 1962, in which men lived in caves or other enclosures for months deprived of temporal cues from the environment, also demonstrated the enduring nature of rhythms in body temperature and in sleep–wakefulness. The rhythmic periods, however, sometimes expanded, the subject beginning to live on an approximately two-day cycle without being aware of it. Through conditioning to time and by way of circadian rhythms, human physiology provides a kind of biological   that offers points of reference for   orientation.

(born June 22, 1919,  , Poland—died May 3, 1982,  , United Kingdom) Polish-born British social  , best known for his concept of social identity, a central idea in what became known as  . He is remembered in Europe for the effort he gave to establishing a European style of  , one that recognized the social, political, and historical   within which social behaviour takes place. Born into a Jewish family in  , Tajfel was a student at the Sorbonne in   when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. A fluent French speaker, he served in the French army, was captured by the invading German forces in 1940, and spent the rest of the conflict as a  . His survival depended on his assuming a French identity and concealing his Polish Jewish heritage. All of Tajfel’s immediate family and most of his friends in Poland were killed in the  . After the war, he spent six years helping to rehabilitate war victims and refugees and to repatriate or resettle them in other countries. Those events affected him deeply and provided him with important   signposts for his later research and writing on   against minorities and on how identity is shaped by nationality and ethnic group membership. Regarding his own wartime experience, he observed that, had his Polish Jewish identity been revealed, his fate would have been determined by his social category. Tajfel married in 1948 and moved to England in 1951. As an undergraduate student at Birkbeck,  , he won a scholarship for an essay on  . He graduated in 1954, worked as a research assistant at the University of Durham, and later became a lecturer in social psychology at the  . In 1967 he was appointed to a chair in social psychology at   University, a post that he held until his death. Bristol soon became a European centre for research in social psychology. Tajfel’s earliest published research was based on what was termed the “new look” in the theory of  , which emphasized that perception is an active rather than a reactive process. People’s mental processes often organize everyday stimuli according to values or needs that are current or   at that moment. For example, a meat eater who is very hungry might mistake a blurred photographic image of a red flower for a juicy steak. Tajfel incorporated such ideas into his work on perceptual accentuation. In one study, the stimuli were eight lines that differed in length by a constant increment. He showed that a simple manipulation (labeling each line either A or B) in an experimental setting caused subjects to misperceive the lines’ lengths and to categorize them accordingly. The concept of accentuation fit with Tajfel’s thinking about social  : members of   are misperceived to fit more closely to   commonly held about them. An important development in Tajfel’s thinking was revealed in a 1970 paper,  “Experiments in Intergroup Discrimination,” in which he explored the concept of social categorization (the classification of people as members of social groups) as a basis for intergroup discrimination (discrimination by members of one group against members of another group). In contrast to realistic group-conflict theory, according to which intergroup conflict derives from mutually incompatible goals, Tajfel proposed that the simple act of becoming a group member is sufficient to precipitate discrimination against members of an available comparison out-group. Thus, intergroup conflict is the result of social categorization rather than competition for   rewards. In Tajfel’s view, social categorization, not intergroup competition, is the key to    . Tajfel and his student  John Turner developed social identity theory in the 1970s. Among the key ideas of social identity theory are the following: 1. Social categorization is a   tool. It is a more powerful determinant of intergroup discrimination than are individual-level variables, such as personality characteristics, which might be shared by both in-group and out-group members. The key to understanding out-group prejudice is that individuals know that they are members of discrete categories—i.e., groups. 2. Social comparison is an intergroup concept, giving rise to   based on group membership. For example, Jane decides that she is advantaged by her   because it confers a higher status when she makes comparisons with other salient ethnic groups. Tajfel’s concept of social comparison contrasts with that of the American cognitive psychologist  , who posited an individual-level concept giving rise to inferences based on interpersonal comparisons. For example, Jim concludes that he is fast because he usually wins footraces against other individuals. 3. Social identity is a crucial aspect of identity. It is part of the self concept and is derived from the knowledge that one belongs to one or more social groups, such as a political or religious group. An individual   to achieve positive self-definition, an outcome based on comparisons that advantage the in-group over salient out-groups. 4. Tajfel’s concept of   is thought by some to be his most innovative contribution to social identity theory. Social change is a significant perceived alteration in the relationship between large social groups, such as national, religious, and ethnic groups. Whereas   is a change in self-definition—as when an individual moves into a new group—social change applies to a transformation of social identity for an entire  . Social change is the process by which people actively seek positive social identities in response to being defined negatively in a world of social inequality. Tajfel drew widely on theory and examples from history,  ,  ,  , and   in elaborating his ideas. He went to considerable lengths to link social identity theory to large-scale social structures and to  . Unlike many theorists in social psychology, Tajfel made a deliberate connection with   movements and political action. Although Tajfel conducted experimental research and encouraged others to do the same, his goals were more ambitious, and he was explicitly opposed to reductionism in social psychological theory. He was mindful of the scope and magnitude of North American social psychology and what it had achieved in defining the   in the 20th century. However, he was convinced that a European perspective could offer something different and valuable. He argued that North American social psychologists were mostly reductionist, even myopic, in their pursuit of psychological laws that applied primarily to individuals rather than to groups. In contrast, Europe’s political history and wars created a need for theoretical constructs that were embedded in social groups.

Content: These five thinkers transformed Western philosophy and shaped its development from the 17th through the 20th century and beyond.  (1596–1650) is traditionally considered the father of modern philosophy for rejecting completely the worldview of Aristotelian   and developing in its place a new science based on mechanistic principles, a new   based on an original form of mind-body (or mind-matter)  , a new   based on methodical doubt (the systematic rejection of any belief that could conceivably be false), and the theory of  . Descartes was also a great mathematician, having invented the field of  , a method of representing and solving algebraic problems geometrically and geometric problems algebraically. He is perhaps best known as the author of the famous phrase   (Latin: “I think, therefore I am”), a version of which he used in his   (1641) as a foundation of absolute certainty on which to reestablish human knowledge of the self (or mind), God, and the external (physical) world. Descartes’s metaphysical dualism, which recognized mind and matter as distinct and irreducible basic substances, gave rise to the modern mind-body problem, the challenge of explaining how mental phenomena can causally interact with physical states and events. His methodical doubt gave rise to the modern  , the challenge of justifying one’s belief that others have mental lives similar to one’s own, among many other epistemological conundrums. And his conception of the mind as a repository of innate ideas gave rise to the philosophical school of   and in the 20th century inspired scientific investigations of innate mental faculties and structures in   and theoretical  . * During the last year of his life, Descartes served as tutor to the young   of Sweden, who made him rise before 5 o’clock in the morning to give her lessons in philosophy. On his way to attend the queen on the morning of February 1, 1650, he caught a chill, and 10 days later he died of pneumonia. * Although Descartes never married, he fathered a child, Francine, by his housekeeper, Helena Jans, in 1635. The girl’s death of scarlet fever at the age of five was the greatest sorrow of Descartes’s life. * To avoid persecution by French religious authorities for his philosophical and scientific views, Descartes spent much of his adult life in the Netherlands. While there he lived alone, concealed his whereabouts, and moved frequently, living in 18 different places in 22 years. * Despite his status as a great thinker, Kant is generally regarded as one of the worst writers in the history of Western philosophy. The bad writing of his first major work, the   (1781), resulted in what he considered a serious misinterpretation by critics and caused him to issue a second edition (1787), whose inconsistency with the first edition has resulted in a centuries-long debate about his original intentions. * Kant’s quiet life and regular habits eventually became an object of curiosity and derision. He was born and died in the same small Prussian town, Königsberg, and it was plausibly said of him that one could set one’s watch by the time he took his regular afternoon walk. * Kant credited the birth of his critical philosophy to the   philosopher  , whose radical empiricism, he said, awoke him from his “dogmatic slumber.”  (1844–1900) was a German philosopher, classicist, and cultural critic whose highly original and penetrating attacks on conventional Western philosophy, religion, and morality profoundly affected the development of European philosophy in the 20th century and influenced important figures in many other intellectual and artistic fields, including theology, psychology, history, literature, and music. His aphoristic, romantic, and often poetic style of writing and the undeniable artistic merit of his German prose contributed to the eventual popularity and influence of his thought. But his characteristically unsystematic and fragmentary philosophical reflections were easily misunderstood or oversimplified. After his death, aspects of his philosophy, especially his notion of the “will to power,” were misrepresented in grossly bowdlerized texts published by his sister,  , who for her own purposes attempted to cast her brother as a prophet of German   and  , a caricature that was enthusiastically adopted by cultural officials of the   regime in the 1930s. In reality, Nietzsche abhorred both nationalism and anti-Semitism. Nietzsche is remembered for many other provocative but frequently misunderstood doctrines, including “slave morality,” the death of God, and the “ ” or  .  * In his early academic career Nietzsche was recognized as a brilliant classical philologist. He was granted a doctorate by the University of Leipzig without dissertation or examination and was appointed to a chair at the University of Basel when he was only 24 years old. * In 1870, while serving as a medical orderly during the Franco-German War, Nietzsche contracted diphtheria and dysentery. He was thereafter in continual ill health, suffering migraine headaches, vomiting, and vision problems that forced his permanent retirement from teaching in 1879. * After collapsing in the street in Turin, Italy, in 1889, Nietzsche became completely and permanently insane. He spent the last 10 years of his life in mental darkness, first in an asylum and then in the care of his mother and sister.

Content: Few animals strike as much fear into people as venomous  . Although the chances of running into a venomous snake, much less being bitten and dying from the toxin injected into one’s body, are miniscule compared to dying from cancer, heart disease, or an automobile accident, this seemingly unreasonable fear remains very real for many people. The snakes described here live primarily in tropical regions, but some might be living in research centers and zoos near you. The “black,” or black-mouthed,   (Dendroaspis polylepis) inhabits rocky savanna and can often be encountered on the ground, where it seems to be fond of termite mounds. Ranging in color from gray to dark brown, its name derives from the blackened inside of its mouth. The black mamba is feared because it is large and quick, and it possesses an extremely potent venom that kills most of its human victims. Despite its aggressive reputation, unprovoked attacks on humans have not been proved, and it is responsible for only a small number of deaths annually.  The venom of some species, including the Okinawa habu (T. flavoviridis), an aggressive snake that often enters human dwellings in the Ryukyu Islands, is mildly dangerous. On the other hand, the venom of the terciopelo (B. asper), the fer-de-lance of Central America is necrotizing, painful, and often deadly. Other dangerous   include the jararaca  (B. jararca) of Brazil and the wutu (Bothrops alternatus) of Argentina. The   ( ) hunts by extending the forward part of its body motionless from a tree, its form mimicking a branch. A rear-fanged snake, it delivers its venom by chewing on its victim until the victim succumbs to the toxins. The eastern   ( ) is the most widely distributed type of tiger snake, which inhabits the southern fringe of Australia and the region’s nearby islands. As it prepares to strike, it flattens its head and neck in a manner similar to Asian and African cobras. The   ( ) may be the deadliest of all snakes, since scientists believe it to be responsible for more human deaths than all other snake species combined. Its venom, however, is lethal in less than 10 percent of untreated victims, but the snake’s aggressiveness means it bites early and often. The   ( ) is a highly venomous relative of the cobra. Its venom is essentially a neurotoxin that induces paralysis. The   ( ) is the longest venomous snake in the world. Its bite delivers a tremendous amount of paralysis-inducing neurotoxins. The snake’s venom is so strong and so voluminous that it can kill an elephant in just a few hours. Death also results in at least 50 to 60 percent of untreated human cases. The coastal taipan ( ) produces venom that is nearly identical to that of its inland cousin. Its bite is lethal in more than 80 percent of untreated cases. The bite of an inland or  — , also called, appropriately, the fierce snake—delivers a veritable witch’s brew of toxins. The venom consists of taipoxin, a complex mix of neurotoxins, procoagulants, and myotoxins that paralyze muscles, inhibit breathing, cause hemorraging in blood vessels and tissues, and damage muscles.

(born March 12, 1685, near Dysert Castle, near Thomastown?, County  , Ireland—died January 14, 1753,  , England) was an Anglo-Irish Anglican  ,  , and scientist best known for his empiricist and idealist  , which holds that reality consists only of minds and their ideas; everything save the spiritual exists only insofar as it is   by the  . Berkeley was the eldest son of William Berkeley, described as a “gentleman” in George’s matriculation entry and as a commissioned officer, a cornet of dragoons, in the entry of a younger brother. Brought up at Dysert Castle, Berkeley entered Kilkenny College in 1696 and  , Dublin, in 1700, where he graduated with a B.A. degree in 1704. While awaiting a fellowship vacancy, he made a critical study of  ,  , and the   that there is no material substance. The principal influences upon his   were  , represented by the English philosopher  , and Continental  , represented by  . His first publication,   and   (published together in 1707), was probably a fellowship thesis. Elected fellow of Trinity College in 1707, Berkeley began to “examine and revise” his “first arguings” in his revision notebooks. The revision was drastic and its results revolutionary. His old principle was largely superseded by his new principle; i.e., his original line of   for immaterialism, based on the   of  ,  , and the other    , was replaced by a simple, profound analysis of the meaning of “ ” or “to exist.” “To be,” said of the  , means to be perceived; “to be,” said of the subject, means to perceive. In what came to be known as the “master argument,” Berkeley called attention to the situation that exists when a person perceives something or imagines it. He argued that, when a person imagines trees or books “and no body by to perceive them,” he is failing to appreciate the whole situation: he is “omitting” the perceiver, for imagined trees or books are necessarily imagined as perceivable. The situation for him is a two-term relation of perceiver and perceived; there is no third term, an “  of” the object, coming between perceiver and perceived. Elsewhere he argued that, because “all sensible objects” are things “we perceive by sense,” and because nothing is perceived “besides our own ideas,” it follows that all sensible objects are ideas. The revision was a gradual development. At the start Berkeley held that nothing exists but “conscious things.” “On second thoughts,” he was certain of the existence of bodies and knew intuitively “the existence of other things besides ourselves.” His expressions, “in the  ” and “without the mind,” must be understood accordingly. As he wrote in his notebook,   and colour (which philosophers had classed as secondary qualities because of their supposed subjectivity) are “as much without the mind” as figure and   (classed as primary qualities) or as time. For both primary and secondary qualities are in the mind in such a way as to be in the thing and are in the thing in such a way as to be in the mind. The mind does not become red, blue, or extended when those qualities are in it; they are not modes or attributes of mind. Colour and extension are not mental qualities for Berkeley: colour can be seen, and extension can be touched; they are “sensible ideas,” or  , the direct objects of percipient mind. Berkeley accepted possible   as well as actual perception; i.e., he accepted the existence of what a person is not actually perceiving but might perceive if he took the appropriate steps. The opposite view was held by some philosophers, including  , who in Berkeley’s words “are by their own principles forced” to accept it. They are forced to accept that objects actually seen and touched have only an   existence, that they come into existence when perceived and pass into nothingness when no longer perceived. Berkeley treated those views with respect: he denied that they are absurd. But he did not hold them, and he explicitly denied that they follow from his principles. In effect he said to his readers, “You may hold, if you will, that objects of sense have only an ‘in-and-out’  , that they are created and   with every turn of man’s attention; but do not father those views on me. I do not hold them.” In his notebook he wrote, “Existence is   or   The horse is in the stable, the Books are in the study as before.” Horse and books, when not being actually perceived by any person, are still there, still perceivable, “still with relation to perception.” To a nonphilosophical friend Berkeley wrote, “I question not the existence of anything that we perceive by our senses.” Berkeley’s immaterialism is open to “gross misinterpretation,” as he said in his preface; rightly understood, it is common sense. Like most people, he accepted and built on “two heads,” “two kinds entirely distinct and heterogeneous”: (1) active mind or spirit, perceiving, thinking, and willing, and (2) passive objects of mind, namely sensible ideas (sense-data) or imaginable ideas.

Content: A cashless society is one in which  , in the form of physical banknotes and  , is not accepted in any financial transaction. Instead, people and businesses transfer   to one another digitally—via   or   cards, electronic money transfers,  , or online and mobile payment services, such as   and Apple Pay. Although no existing society is cashless, many economists believe that consumer preferences, competitive pressures on businesses, profit seeking by  , and government policies designed to facilitate cashless transactions will soon lead to at least a few cashless societies. There are various measures of cashlessness, yielding different rankings of countries along a “cashless continuum,” but most experts agree that Sweden is now closest to the cashless ideal. Cash is now used in less than 15 percent of transactions in that country, and the value of cash in circulation has declined significantly in the 21st century, now representing about 1 percent of GDP. Swedish retailers and restaurants are now permitted to refuse cash payments merely by posting a sign, and more than half of all Swedish bank branches no longer handle cash. To facilitate the transition to cashlessness,   in some countries have introduced government-backed digital   to replace or complement banknotes and coins. Proponents of a cashless society argue that digital transactions are more convenient for both customers and businesses and that cashlessness would cut down on many criminal activities. They also maintain that the trend toward cashlessness is unstoppable, given the increasing digitization of economies and consumers’ growing preference for conducting daily business with mobile devices. The trend has been propelled, however, by banks that have intentionally made cash transactions less convenient for their customers (e.g., by closing branches and removing ATMs) to encourage the use of digital services that are more profitable. The global coronavirus pandemic that began in 2020 also contributed heavily to an increase in touchless and cashless transactions. But there are potential drawbacks to a cashless society. First, it would largely exclude “unbanked” (mostly poor) persons, who do not use or cannot obtain a bank account. Second, it could invite serious breaches of  , because few purchases and sales would be anonymous. Third, even minor technological glitches could block access to funds, and systemic failures due to natural disasters or massive hacking could make all purchases and payments impossible. Fourth, during a severe economic crisis threatening the solvency of major banks, depositors would be unable to rescue their money by withdrawing it in cash. Nor could depositors prevent troubled banks from taking a portion of their deposits in “bail-in” scenarios, under which the institution’s shareholders and creditors, including depositors, are held responsible for its debts (in the U.S., up to $250,000 of each deposit would be protected from such seizures). Finally, ordinary depositors would not be able to protect themselves from negative   rates, which central banks in some countries (e.g., Japan) have imposed to combat   or deflation after cuts in positive interest rates to near zero have failed. Negative interest rates permit private banks to charge depositors what amounts to a fee for holding their money, thus encouraging them to spend and invest. Indeed, some economists consider that to be an argument in favor of a cashless society, as it would make painfully deep negative interest rates workable because they could not be avoided through cash withdrawals.

Content: The debate over whether abortion should be a legal option has long divided people around the world. Split into two groups, pro-choice and pro-life, the two sides frequently clash in protests. A June 2, 2022  , 55% of Americans identified as “pro-choice,” the highest percentage since 1995. 39% identified as “pro-life,” and 5% were neither or unsure. For the first time in the history of the poll question (since 2001), 52% of Americans believe abortion is morally acceptable. 38% believed the procedure to be morally wrong, and 10% answered that it depended on the situation or they were unsure. Surgical abortion (aka suction curettage or vacuum curettage) is the most common type of abortion procedure. It involves using a suction device to remove the contents of a pregnant woman’s uterus. Surgical abortion performed later in pregnancy (after 12-16 weeks) is called D&E (dilation and evacuation). The second most common abortion procedure, a medical abortion (aka an “abortion pill”), involves taking medications, usually mifepristone and misoprostol (aka RU-486), within the first seven to nine weeks of pregnancy to induce an abortion. The   (CDC) found that 67% of abortions performed in 2014 were performed at or less than eight weeks’ gestation, and 91.5% were performed at or less than 13 weeks’ gestation. 77.3% were performed by surgical procedure, while 22.6% were medical abortions. An abortion can cost from $500 to over $1,000 depending on where it is performed and how long into the pregnancy it is.

Space perception provides cues, such as depth and distance, that are important for movement and orientation to the  . Human beings have been interested in the   of objects in space at least since antiquity. It was popularly thought in   that objects could be seen because they emitted what was imagined to be a continuous series of extremely thin “membranes” in their own image; these fell upon the eye and merged into the picture that was perceived. Centuries of experimental research led to a more tenable   in which space was described in terms of three   or planes: height (vertical plane), width (horizontal plane), and depth (sagittal plane). These planes all intersect at right angles, and their single axis of intersection is defined as being located within perceived three-dimensional space—that is, in the “eye” of the perceiving individual. Humans do not ordinarily perceive a binocular space (a separate visual world from each eye) but instead see a so-called  , as if the images from each eye fuse to produce a single visual field akin to that of Cyclops, a one-eyed giant in  . The horizontal, vertical, and sagittal planes divide space into various sectors: something is perceived as “above” or “below” (the horizontal plane), as “in front of” or “behind” (the vertical plane), or as “to the right” or “to the left” (of the sagittal plane). An early theory put forth by the Anglican bishop   at the beginning of the 18th century was that the third dimension (depth) cannot be directly perceived by the eyes because the retinal image of any object is two-dimensional, as in a painting. He held that the ability to have visual experiences of depth is not inborn but can result only from logical deduction based on   learning through the use of other senses such as touch. Although modern research fails to verify Berkeley’s emphasis on reason as central to perception, contemporary theories still include both nativistic (inborn) and empirical (learned through experience) considerations. The study of   developed rapidly in the second half of the 19th century and still more rapidly during the 20th. Many psychologists who deal with perceptual function hold that the study of space perception is rapidly becoming a distinct branch of   in its own right. This special field within psychology concentrates on the factors contributing to the perceived organization of objects in space (e.g., on cues to depth perception, movement, form, colour, and their interactions) or dwells on particularly interesting special problems such as that of  amodal perception (e.g., the question of how one perceives that there are six sides to a cube, even though only three of them can be seen at a single time). Space perception research also offers insight into ways that perceptual   helps orient the individual to the environment. Specifically, orientation in space typically seems to reflect one’s strivings (e.g., to seek food or to avoid injury). People could not orient themselves to their  , however, unless the environmental information reaching them through the various sense organs offered a perception of space that corresponds to their physical “reality.” Such perception is called  veridical perception—the direct perception of stimuli as they exist. Without some degree of veridicality concerning physical space, one cannot seek food, flee from enemies, or even socialize. Veridical perception also causes a person to experience changing stimuli as if they were stable: even though the sensory image of an approaching tiger grows larger, for example, one tends to perceive that the animal’s size remains unchanged. In other words, one perceives objects in the environment as having relatively constant   (as to size, colour, and so on) despite considerable variations in stimulus conditions. Not all perception of space, however, is veridical; instead, perception may fail to correspond to reality—often in some systematic way. These are cases of nonveridical perception. Experiments have shown that the three basic spatial planes (horizontal, vertical, and sagittal) dominate the ability of the individual to localize visual objects in nearby space. Often, objects can be perceived as   closer to these basic dimensions or planes than they really are. (Part of the explanation of these perceptual discrepancies in visual experience may lie in the force of  .) Nonveridical perceptions do not generate   in one’s perception of space. Instead, they clarify the perceived characteristics of surrounding space. If all of the mass of sensory information available at a given moment were perceived veridically, the flood of data might confuse the perceiver to the point of disorientation. In other words, some degree of selectivity in perception appears to guide the survival of the individual. Ideally, information about the environment is perceived only as it is relevant to the goals, needs, or physiological state of the individual at a given moment.

Content: These five thinkers transformed Western philosophy and shaped its development from the 17th through the 20th century and beyond.  (1596–1650) is traditionally considered the father of modern philosophy for rejecting completely the worldview of Aristotelian   and developing in its place a new science based on mechanistic principles, a new   based on an original form of mind-body (or mind-matter)  , a new   based on methodical doubt (the systematic rejection of any belief that could conceivably be false), and the theory of  . Descartes was also a great mathematician, having invented the field of  , a method of representing and solving algebraic problems geometrically and geometric problems algebraically. He is perhaps best known as the author of the famous phrase   (Latin: “I think, therefore I am”), a version of which he used in his   (1641) as a foundation of absolute certainty on which to reestablish human knowledge of the self (or mind), God, and the external (physical) world. Descartes’s metaphysical dualism, which recognized mind and matter as distinct and irreducible basic substances, gave rise to the modern mind-body problem, the challenge of explaining how mental phenomena can causally interact with physical states and events. His methodical doubt gave rise to the modern  , the challenge of justifying one’s belief that others have mental lives similar to one’s own, among many other epistemological conundrums. And his conception of the mind as a repository of innate ideas gave rise to the philosophical school of   and in the 20th century inspired scientific investigations of innate mental faculties and structures in   and theoretical  . * During the last year of his life, Descartes served as tutor to the young   of Sweden, who made him rise before 5 o’clock in the morning to give her lessons in philosophy. On his way to attend the queen on the morning of February 1, 1650, he caught a chill, and 10 days later he died of pneumonia. * Although Descartes never married, he fathered a child, Francine, by his housekeeper, Helena Jans, in 1635. The girl’s death of scarlet fever at the age of five was the greatest sorrow of Descartes’s life. * To avoid persecution by French religious authorities for his philosophical and scientific views, Descartes spent much of his adult life in the Netherlands. While there he lived alone, concealed his whereabouts, and moved frequently, living in 18 different places in 22 years. * Despite his status as a great thinker, Kant is generally regarded as one of the worst writers in the history of Western philosophy. The bad writing of his first major work, the   (1781), resulted in what he considered a serious misinterpretation by critics and caused him to issue a second edition (1787), whose inconsistency with the first edition has resulted in a centuries-long debate about his original intentions. * Kant’s quiet life and regular habits eventually became an object of curiosity and derision. He was born and died in the same small Prussian town, Königsberg, and it was plausibly said of him that one could set one’s watch by the time he took his regular afternoon walk. * Kant credited the birth of his critical philosophy to the   philosopher  , whose radical empiricism, he said, awoke him from his “dogmatic slumber.”  (1844–1900) was a German philosopher, classicist, and cultural critic whose highly original and penetrating attacks on conventional Western philosophy, religion, and morality profoundly affected the development of European philosophy in the 20th century and influenced important figures in many other intellectual and artistic fields, including theology, psychology, history, literature, and music. His aphoristic, romantic, and often poetic style of writing and the undeniable artistic merit of his German prose contributed to the eventual popularity and influence of his thought. But his characteristically unsystematic and fragmentary philosophical reflections were easily misunderstood or oversimplified. After his death, aspects of his philosophy, especially his notion of the “will to power,” were misrepresented in grossly bowdlerized texts published by his sister,  , who for her own purposes attempted to cast her brother as a prophet of German   and  , a caricature that was enthusiastically adopted by cultural officials of the   regime in the 1930s. In reality, Nietzsche abhorred both nationalism and anti-Semitism. Nietzsche is remembered for many other provocative but frequently misunderstood doctrines, including “slave morality,” the death of God, and the “ ” or  .  * In his early academic career Nietzsche was recognized as a brilliant classical philologist. He was granted a doctorate by the University of Leipzig without dissertation or examination and was appointed to a chair at the University of Basel when he was only 24 years old. * In 1870, while serving as a medical orderly during the Franco-German War, Nietzsche contracted diphtheria and dysentery. He was thereafter in continual ill health, suffering migraine headaches, vomiting, and vision problems that forced his permanent retirement from teaching in 1879. * After collapsing in the street in Turin, Italy, in 1889, Nietzsche became completely and permanently insane. He spent the last 10 years of his life in mental darkness, first in an asylum and then in the care of his mother and sister. Various causes of his breakdown have been proposed, including tertiary syphilis and retro-orbital meningioma, a tumor on the surface of his brain behind his right eye. * Three of Wittgenstein’s four brothers committed suicide.  * When Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge, he submitted the   as a dissertation in fulfillment of the doctoral degree. His oral examination was conducted by Russell and Moore, a ritual that both older philosophers regarded as absurd. Wittgenstein ended the discussion by telling his examiners, “Don’t worry, I know you’ll never understand it.” He was passed anyway. * Wittgenstein’s obsessive, neurotic, and domineering personality was well known and caused even some of his admirers, including Russell, to openly question his sanity. At a meeting of the Moral Sciences Club at Cambridge in 1946, Wittgenstein flew into a rage at a guest speaker, the eminent philosopher of science  , and allegedly threatened him with a poker that he had pulled from a fireplace. According to one version of the story, violence was averted only after Russell ordered Wittgenstein to put the poker down. * Several of Heidegger’s students became important thinkers in their own right. One of them, the political theorist  , had an affair with the married Heidegger in the 1920s. Because of her Jewish heritage, she fled Germany after the Nazi takeover in 1933. * In 2014 the first three volumes of Heidegger’s so-called “black notebooks,” containing his private philosophical and political reflections, were published in Germany. They contained several overtly anti-Semitic passages woven into philosophical discussions, apparently lending support to the view that aspects of Heidegger’s philosophy were inherently fascistic. * Heidegger’s complete works, when finally published, will run to more than 100 volumes, making him one of the most prolific writers in the history of Western philosophy.

After receiving a Ph.D. in psychology at   in 1928, Gibson joined the faculty of  . He married   (née Jack)—who would become a prominent psychologist in her own right—in 1932. During   he served in the Army Air Forces (1942–46), where he did research on visual aircraft identification and on increasing the effectiveness of training films, among other topics. After the war he returned to Smith College before moving to   in 1949. He retired in 1972. Gibson developed what he called an “ecological approach” to the study of visual perception, according to which humans perceive their   directly, without mediation by   processes or by mental entities such as  . Perceiving a tree, for example, does not consist of constructing a mental image of a tree from stimuli (light energy) entering the visual system and then attributing the visual properties of the image to the tree itself. Instead, one directly sees the visual properties of the tree. This idea was radical because it contradicted a centuries-old model of the origins of human knowledge. As Gibson himself put it, “The old idea that sensory inputs are converted into perceptions by operations of the   is rejected.” Gibson created a highly influential theory of “ affordances,” which are qualities of an object or   that communicate opportunities to do certain things (e.g., dark shade indicates an opportunity to get out of the sunshine; a thick cushion signals the availability of comfortable seating). According to Gibson, affordances exist naturally and are directly perceived by the viewer. His work had a large impact in  , or  , which is partly concerned with the perceived affordances in products designed for human use. In addition to   (1979), Gibson’s most important writings include   (1950) and    (1966). His followers organized the International Society for Ecological Psychology in 1981.

In the ensuing decades, he was the subject of countless books, documentaries, and TV shows. This list presents some notable, and a few lesser-known, facts about him.  Adolf Hitler was almost Adolf Schicklgruber. Or Adolf Hiedler. His father, Alois, was born out of wedlock to Maria Anna Schicklgruber and given her surname. However, when he was about 40 years old, Alois decided to adopt the last name of his stepfather, Johann Georg Hiedler, who some speculated was actually his biological father. On the legal documents,   was given as the new last name, though the reason for the spelling change is unknown. Alois Hitler was married twice and had several children before taking Klara Pölzl as his third wife. The couple had six children, though only Adolf and a sister reached adulthood. Adolf had a difficult relationship with his father, who died in 1903, but he adored his mother and was reportedly grief-stricken by her death from breast cancer in 1907.  When he committed suicide in 1945, Hitler was wearing the   First Class medal, earned for his service in  . The honor was especially important to Hitler, who had portrayed himself as a hero during the conflict. Although he was wounded during the   (1916), recent research challenges Hitler’s account of his war experience. Some believe that he saw little if any front-line action and instead was a runner at the relatively safe regiment headquarters. This would counter his claims that he was in danger “probably every day.” In addition, while he stated that he was temporarily blinded during a mustard-gas attack in 1918, purported medical documents state that he suffered from “hysterical blindness.” He was recuperating when Germany surrendered. Oddly, his citation for the Iron Cross First Class fails to mention a specific incident of bravery, leading some researchers to speculate that it was given to honor Hitler’s length of service and his general likability with officers, notably Hugo Gutmann, a Jewish lieutenant who recommended that Hitler receive the award.  In 1924, while in prison for high treason, Hitler began writing what would later be considered one of the world’s most dangerous books. In   (“My Struggle”), which was initially published in two volumes (1925, 1927), Hitler chronicled his life and presented his racist ideology; he claimed to have become “a fanatical  ” while living in Vienna. Although it initially had only limited success,  ’s popularity grew as did that of Hitler and the  . A bible of  , it was required reading in Germany, and by 1939 more than five million copies had been sold. After Hitler’s death, the work was banned in Germany and other countries, and the German state of  , which held the copyright, refused to grant publishing rights. However, some foreign publishers continued to print the work, and in 2016 it entered the public domain after the copyright expired. Days later a heavily annotated   was published in Germany for the first time since 1945. It became a best seller.  Following a series of maneuverings and intrigues, Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany in January 1933. However, he aspired to even greater power, and that was achieved when Germany’s parliamentary building caught fire and was severely damaged on February 27, 1933. While Hitler’s involvement in the   remains uncertain—a lone communist was later convicted of the crime—he used the event to solidify his authority. The day after the blaze, he oversaw the suspension of all civil liberties, and in the following month’s election, the Nazis and their allies secured a majority in the Reichstag. On March 23, 1933, the Reichstag passed the  , which sanctioned Hitler’s dictatorship. Then, in August 1934, shortly after the death of Pres.  , the German people voted to give Hitler complete authority, combining the offices of chancellor and president to create the post of “  und Reichskanzler” (“Leader and Chancellor”).  While much has been made of Hitler’s failed career as an artist—he was rejected by the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts and lived in poverty trying to sell his work—his interest in art seemed only to increase after he became führer. While Hitler favored the idealized work of Classical Greece and Rome, he was highly critical of contemporary movements such as  ,  , and  . In the 1930s Nazis began removing such “ ” from German museums. Modern works by  ,  ,  , and   were later shown in a 1937 multicity exhibition and described as “culture documents of the decadent work of Bolsheviks and Jews.” Throughout the war, Hitler ordered the systematic looting of artworks on an unprecedented scale; reportedly his most coveted stolen item was the  . This and other works were intended to fill a planned “super museum” in Linz, Austria, known as the Führermuseum.  In attempting to build a master “ ” race, the Nazis were known for promoting health-conscious policies. So, it is perhaps not surprising that Hitler was reportedly a teetotaler, nonsmoker, and vegetarian. However, his healthy habits were undermined by his alleged use of opiates. According to recent research, in 1941 his personal physician, Theodor Morell, began injecting him with various drugs, including  ,  ,  , and even  . In fact, drug use was reportedly prevalent throughout the Nazi Party, and soldiers were often given meth before battle. Near the end of his life, Hitler was prone to shaking, and, while some have attributed this to  , others have speculated it was withdrawal from drugs, which by then were hard to obtain.  Perhaps spurred by his earlier poverty, Hitler seemed determined to amass a personal fortune. Much of his money came from predictable sources—siphoning off government money and accepting “donations” from corporations. However, he also undertook more creative schemes. After becoming chancellor, he notably ordered the government to buy copies of his   to give as state wedding gifts to newlyweds, leading to hefty royalties for Hitler. In addition, he refused to pay income tax. He used his vast wealth—which some estimated was about $5 billion—to amass an extensive art collection, purchase fine furnishings, and acquire various properties. After the war, his estate was given to Bavaria.  In 1939 a Swedish legislator nominated Hitler for the  . Although he intended it as a joke, few found it amusing. Instead, it created an uproar, and the nomination was quickly withdrawn. Not that Hitler would have wanted—or even been able to accept—the award. In 1936 German journalist  , a vocal critic of Hitler, had been named the winner of the 1935 peace prize. The gesture was seen as a censure of Nazism and an “insult” to Germany. As a result, Hitler barred all Germans from accepting a   and created the German National Prize for Art and Science as an alternative. The three Germans who subsequently won Nobels during the Third Reich were forced to decline their awards, though they later received the diplomas and medals.  On April 30, 1945, with the war lost and Soviet troops advancing, Hitler committed suicide in his underground bunker in Berlin, shooting himself.  , whom he had recently married, also took her own life. According to Hitler’s wishes, their bodies were burned and then buried. At least, that is the widely accepted version of his death. Almost immediately conspiracy theories began—thanks in part to the Soviets. They initially claimed that they were unable to confirm that Hitler was dead and later spread rumors that he was alive and being protected by the West. When pressed by U.S. Pres.  , Soviet leader   stated that he did not know Hitler’s fate. According to later reports, however, the Soviets recovered his burnt remains, which were identified through dental records. The body was secretly buried before being exhumed and cremated, the ashes being scattered in 1970, though a piece of skull—bearing a single gunshot wound and not found until 1946—was kept. Such news failed to stem the doubts, however, and they only increased in 2009, when researchers determined that the skull fragment actually belonged to a woman.

While a student at  , Land became interested in  ,   light in which all rays are aligned in the same plane. He took a leave of absence, and, after intensive study and experimentation, succeeded (1932) in aligning submicroscopic crystals of iodoquinine sulfate and embedding them in a sheet of plastic. The resulting polarizer, for which he   numerous uses and which he dubbed Polaroid J sheet, was a tremendous advance. It allowed the use of almost any size of polarizer and significantly reduced the cost. With George Wheelwright III, a Harvard   instructor, Land founded the  ,  , in 1932. He developed and, in 1936, began to use numerous types of Polaroid material in sunglasses and other optical devices. Polaroid was later used in camera filters and other optical equipment. Land founded the Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, Mass., in 1937. Four years later he developed a widely used, three-dimensional motion-picture process based on polarized light. During   he applied the polarizing principle to various types of military equipment. Land began work on an instantaneous developing film after the war. In 1947 he demonstrated a camera (known as the  ) that produced a finished print in 60 seconds. The Land photographic process soon found numerous commercial, military, and scientific applications. Many   were made in the following years, including the development of a colour process. Land’s Polaroid Land cameras, which were able to produce developed photographs within one minute after the exposure, became some of the most popular cameras in the world. Land’s interest in light and colour resulted in a new theory of  . In a series of experiments he revealed certain conflicts in the classical theory of colour perception. He found that the colour perceived is not dependent on the relative amounts of blue, green, and red light entering the eye; he proposed that at least three independent image-forming mechanisms, which he called retinexes, are sensitive to different colours and work in   to indicate the colour seen. Land received more than 500 patents for his innovations in light and plastics. In 1980 he retired as   of Polaroid but remained active in the field of light and colour research by working with the  , a nonprofit centre supported by the Rowland Foundation, Inc., a corporation that Land founded in 1960. Under Land’s direction, Rowland researchers discovered that perception of light and colour is regulated essentially by the brain, rather than through a spectrum system in the retina of the eye, as was previously believed.

Content: One of the great   painters,   continually tested artistic traditions and techniques. He created innovative compositions, investigated anatomy to accurately represent the human body, considered the human psyche to illustrate character, and experimented with methods of representing space and three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface. The result of his inexhaustible curiosity is many unfinished projects but also some of the most lifelike, complex, and tender representations of human nature. His experiments influenced the art of his successors and often became the standard of representation in subsequent centuries. At his death in 1519, Leonardo left many notebooks filled with jottings and sketches but very few finished works. Some of his pieces were completed by assistants, but others were lost, destroyed, or overpainted. Below are 10 examples of some of his most well-known surviving works. The world’s most famous artwork, the   draws thousands of visitors to the   each day, many of whom are compelled by the sitter’s mysterious gaze and enigmatic smile. The seemingly ordinary portrait of a young woman dressed modestly in a thin veil, somber colors, and no jewelry might also confound its viewers, who may wonder what all the fuss is about. The painting’s simplicity belies Leonardo’s talent for realism. The subject’s softly modeled face shows his skillful handling of  , an artistic technique that uses subtle gradations of light and shadow, rather than line, to model form. The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric reveal Leonardo’s tireless patience in recreating his studied observations. Moreover, the sitter’s perplexing expression only adds to her realism. Her smile might be engaging or it might be mocking—  because, like a human, she is a complex figure, embodying contrary characteristics simultaneously. One of the most famous paintings in the world, the   was commissioned by  , duke of Milan and Leonardo’s patron during his first stay in that city, for the Dominican monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie. Depicting a sequential narrative, Leonardo illustrates several closely connected moments in the Gospels, including Matthew 26:21–28, in which Jesus declares that one of the Apostles will betray him and then institutes the  . Leonardo, who was intrigued by the manner in which a man’s character can reveal itself in posture, expression, and gesture, depicted each disciple’s unique reaction to the declaration. The Apostles’ postures rise, fall, extend, and intertwine as they appear to whisper, yell, grieve, and debate around Jesus, who sits serenely in the center. Because of Leonardo’s experimental painting technique, in which he used tempera or oil paint on two layers of preparatory ground, the work began to disintegrate soon after he finished it. Viewers, however, can still recognize it as a complex study of varied human emotion, revealed in a deceptively simple composition. Leonardo’s pen-and-ink drawing   comes from one of the many notebooks that he kept on hand during his mature years. It is accompanied by notes, written in mirror script, on the ideal human proportions that the Roman architect   laid out in a book on architecture from the 1st century BCE. The drawing illustrates Vitruvius’s theory that the ideal human could fit within a circle and a square, two irreconcilable shapes. Leonardo resolved the concept by drawing a male figure in two superimposed positions—one with his arms outstretched to fit in a square and another with his legs and arms spread in a circle. The work shows not only Leonardo’s effort to understand significant texts but also his desire to expand on them. He was not the first to illustrate Vitruvius’s concepts, but his drawing later became the most iconic, partly because its combination of mathematics, philosophy, and art seemed a fitting symbol of the Renaissance. The drawing is now housed in the  , where it is not typically on display but kept in a climate-controlled archive.  Long regarded as a self-portrait, the red chalk drawing of an old man with long wavy hair and a beard has been reproduced to such an extent that it defines how most people think of Leonardo’s appearance. Yet some scholars argue that the figure, with its craggy features, furrowed brow, and downcast eyes, appears much older than the age Leonardo ever reached; Leonardo died at age 67. They propose that the drawing may be one of his grotesque drawings, sketches he habitually made in his notebooks of people with eccentric features. Whomever the portrait represents, it is a departure from Leonardo’s often captivating subjects, yet he managed to imbue the figure with the nobility and wisdom of a mature age. Based on stylistic evidence, many scholars consider the painting   in the Louvre the first of two paintings that Leonardo made of an apocryphal legend in which the Holy Family meets   as they flee to Egypt from  ’s Massacre of the Innocents. Leonardo was involved in years of litigation with the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, which commissioned the work, and the dispute eventually led Leonardo to paint another version of the subject about 1508, which is now housed in the National Gallery of London. The first painting shows the ways in which Leonardo ushered in the High  . Early paintings from this period often depicted figures in linear arrangements, separate from one another, and stiff in form. In  , however, the figures of the  , the Christ Child, the infant John, and an   are arranged in a pyramidal composition, and they not only convincingly occupy a space but interact with one another through gestures and glances. A youthful Mary sits on the ground in a mysterious rocky landscape, not on a throne as so many early Renaissance paintings depicted her. Her body has movement—it seems to sway as she tilts her head protectively toward the infant John, who kneels in prayer at the left, and she looks as if she nudges him over to the Christ Child at the right. Jesus, in turn, blesses John as an archangel, seen in a complex pose from the back, points toward John and glances inscrutably outward at the viewer. Leonardo also notably excluded traditional holy signifiers—  for Mary and Christ and a staff for John—so that the Holy Family appears less divine and more human. , a small brush drawing with pigment, depicts a young woman with her head tilted and her eyes downcast. Her posture recalls the Virgin Mary in Leonardo’s  , suggesting that the drawing may have served as a model. The drawing’s  ,  , translates to “disheveled” and refers to the young woman’s wayward strands of hair. The loosely sketched tendrils and shoulders contrast with the highly finished face, where Leonardo gently modeled the woman’s delicate features, from her heavy eyelids to her tender lips. It reveals Leonardo’s fluid means of working, utilizing both expressive drawing to create form and controlled layering to provide detail. Many art historians identify the youthful woman in   as Cecilia Gallerani, the mistress of Leonardo’s patron, Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan. The ermine was often used as an emblem for the duke. The woman turns her head to the right, her bright eyes seemingly directed toward something outside the frame. Although the painting has been heavily overpainted, notably the dark background, it nonetheless reveals Leonardo’s knowledge of anatomy and his ability to represent character in posture and expression. He captures the girl’s youth and genial nature in her guileless features, attentive gaze, and tender embrace of the ermine, which sits with its head cocked regally and alert. Her slender hand reveals the complicated bone structure beneath the skin, just as the head of the ermine suggests the skull underneath the finely rendered fur. The head-on portrait of   (c. 1500; “Savior of the World”) made headlines in 2017 when it sold for a record-breaking $450.3 million at auction. The high price was all the more surprising when considering that   was in poor condition, it had a questionable history, and its attribution was a   among scholars and critics. Many pundits remarked on the poor skill used to represent Jesus’ face; the stiff posture, which was so unlike the Renaissance master’s characteristic twisting poses; and the unconvincing representation of the glass globe, which, if solid, would have reflected a distorted view of its holder, an optical trick that Leonardo would have known about. Christie’s, the auction house that managed the sale, dismissed the criticisms, noting that any lack of craft was the result of heavy restoration in previous centuries and pointed to the soft modeling of Jesus’ right hand and the finesse of his tight curls, both characteristics that resembled Leonardo’s technique. The auction house also asserted that conservators had confirmed that the painting was made of the same materials that Leonardo would have used, notably  , an expensive high-quality blue pigment often reserved exclusively for virtuosos. The attribution debate continued well after the sale, but the interest in the work and the large sum paid at auction attested to Leonardo’s enduring celebrity and to his powerful position in the art history canon five centuries after his death. Housed in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the   is the only painting by Leonardo publicly displayed in the Western Hemisphere. It is one of Leonardo’s earliest works, finished when he was in his early 20s, and shows some of the unconventional methods he would use throughout his career. Inspired by his Northern contemporaries, Leonardo broke with tradition by depicting the solemn young woman in a three-quarter pose rather than the customary profile, and thus he may have been the first Italian artist to paint such a composition. He continued to use the three-quarter view in all of his portraits, including the  , and it quickly became the standard for portraiture, so ubiquitous that viewers take it for granted today. Leonardo may also have used his fingers when the paint was still tacky to model Ginevra’s face, as suggested by the fingerprints found in the paint surface. On the reverse side of the painting, a wreath of laurel and palm encircles a sprig of juniper (  in Italian—a pun on the sitter’s name), and a scroll bearing the Latin phrase “beauty adorns virtue” entwines each of the flora. The truncated appearance of the reverse side suggests that the painting may have been cut at the bottom, possibly because of damage from water or fire. Some scholars speculate that the portrait on the obverse would have included Ginevra’s hands and propose that a silverpoint study of arms and hands housed at   may have served as a preliminary drawing. Some scholars believe that   was Leonardo’s last painting, and in this work he used many of the conventions that he had established throughout his career to depict three generations of the Holy Family— , her daughter, the Virgin Mary, and the Christ Child. Anne, at the apex of the pyramidal composition, watches Mary, who sits on her lap, as the Virgin tenderly restrains the Christ Child from mounting a lamb. Contrasting with the knowing infant Leonardo depicted in  , the Christ figure in the   appears innocent, demonstrating playful juvenile behavior and showing a trusting expression as he returns his mother’s gaze. The interactions between the figures feels intimate and reveals Leonardo’s ability to represent convincing human relationships. The painting also shows Leonardo’s lifelong interest in believably representing three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. As in many of Leonardo’s paintings, the figures sit amid a fantastical landscape. Using  , a technique that he wrote about in his  , Leonardo created the illusion of distance by painting the rocky formations in the background so that they appear blue-gray and less detailed than the landscape of the foreground. He used this technique in many of the landscapes of his earlier works, including the   and  .

Content: The debate over whether abortion should be a legal option has long divided people around the world. Split into two groups, pro-choice and pro-life, the two sides frequently clash in protests. A June 2, 2022  , 55% of Americans identified as “pro-choice,” the highest percentage since 1995. 39% identified as “pro-life,” and 5% were neither or unsure. For the first time in the history of the poll question (since 2001), 52% of Americans believe abortion is morally acceptable. 38% believed the procedure to be morally wrong, and 10% answered that it depended on the situation or they were unsure. Surgical abortion (aka suction curettage or vacuum curettage) is the most common type of abortion procedure. It involves using a suction device to remove the contents of a pregnant woman’s uterus. Surgical abortion performed later in pregnancy (after 12-16 weeks) is called D&E (dilation and evacuation). The second most common abortion procedure, a medical abortion (aka an “abortion pill”), involves taking medications, usually mifepristone and misoprostol (aka RU-486), within the first seven to nine weeks of pregnancy to induce an abortion. The   (CDC) found that 67% of abortions performed in 2014 were performed at or less than eight weeks’ gestation, and 91.5% were performed at or less than 13 weeks’ gestation. 77.3% were performed by surgical procedure, while 22.6% were medical abortions. An abortion can cost from $500 to over $1,000 depending on where it is performed and how long into the pregnancy it is.

(born June 22, 1919,  , Poland—died May 3, 1982,  , United Kingdom) Polish-born British social  , best known for his concept of social identity, a central idea in what became known as  . He is remembered in Europe for the effort he gave to establishing a European style of  , one that recognized the social, political, and historical   within which social behaviour takes place. Born into a Jewish family in  , Tajfel was a student at the Sorbonne in   when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. A fluent French speaker, he served in the French army, was captured by the invading German forces in 1940, and spent the rest of the conflict as a  . His survival depended on his assuming a French identity and concealing his Polish Jewish heritage. All of Tajfel’s immediate family and most of his friends in Poland were killed in the  . After the war, he spent six years helping to rehabilitate war victims and refugees and to repatriate or resettle them in other countries. Those events affected him deeply and provided him with important   signposts for his later research and writing on   against minorities and on how identity is shaped by nationality and ethnic group membership. Regarding his own wartime experience, he observed that, had his Polish Jewish identity been revealed, his fate would have been determined by his social category. Tajfel married in 1948 and moved to England in 1951. As an undergraduate student at Birkbeck,  , he won a scholarship for an essay on  . He graduated in 1954, worked as a research assistant at the University of Durham, and later became a lecturer in social psychology at the  . In 1967 he was appointed to a chair in social psychology at   University, a post that he held until his death. Bristol soon became a European centre for research in social psychology. Tajfel’s earliest published research was based on what was termed the “new look” in the theory of  , which emphasized that perception is an active rather than a reactive process. People’s mental processes often organize everyday stimuli according to values or needs that are current or   at that moment. For example, a meat eater who is very hungry might mistake a blurred photographic image of a red flower for a juicy steak. Tajfel incorporated such ideas into his work on perceptual accentuation. In one study, the stimuli were eight lines that differed in length by a constant increment. He showed that a simple manipulation (labeling each line either A or B) in an experimental setting caused subjects to misperceive the lines’ lengths and to categorize them accordingly. The concept of accentuation fit with Tajfel’s thinking about social  : members of   are misperceived to fit more closely to   commonly held about them. An important development in Tajfel’s thinking was revealed in a 1970 paper,  “Experiments in Intergroup Discrimination,” in which he explored the concept of social categorization (the classification of people as members of social groups) as a basis for intergroup discrimination (discrimination by members of one group against members of another group). In contrast to realistic group-conflict theory, according to which intergroup conflict derives from mutually incompatible goals, Tajfel proposed that the simple act of becoming a group member is sufficient to precipitate discrimination against members of an available comparison out-group. Thus, intergroup conflict is the result of social categorization rather than competition for   rewards. In Tajfel’s view, social categorization, not intergroup competition, is the key to    . Tajfel and his student  John Turner developed social identity theory in the 1970s. Among the key ideas of social identity theory are the following: 1. Social categorization is a   tool. It is a more powerful determinant of intergroup discrimination than are individual-level variables, such as personality characteristics, which might be shared by both in-group and out-group members. The key to understanding out-group prejudice is that individuals know that they are members of discrete categories—i.e., groups. 2. Social comparison is an intergroup concept, giving rise to   based on group membership. For example, Jane decides that she is advantaged by her   because it confers a higher status when she makes comparisons with other salient ethnic groups. Tajfel’s concept of social comparison contrasts with that of the American cognitive psychologist  , who posited an individual-level concept giving rise to inferences based on interpersonal comparisons. For example, Jim concludes that he is fast because he usually wins footraces against other individuals. 3. Social identity is a crucial aspect of identity. It is part of the self concept and is derived from the knowledge that one belongs to one or more social groups, such as a political or religious group. An individual   to achieve positive self-definition, an outcome based on comparisons that advantage the in-group over salient out-groups. 4. Tajfel’s concept of   is thought by some to be his most innovative contribution to social identity theory. Social change is a significant perceived alteration in the relationship between large social groups, such as national, religious, and ethnic groups. Whereas   is a change in self-definition—as when an individual moves into a new group—social change applies to a transformation of social identity for an entire  . Social change is the process by which people actively seek positive social identities in response to being defined negatively in a world of social inequality. Tajfel drew widely on theory and examples from history,  ,  ,  , and   in elaborating his ideas. He went to considerable lengths to link social identity theory to large-scale social structures and to  . Unlike many theorists in social psychology, Tajfel made a deliberate connection with   movements and political action. Although Tajfel conducted experimental research and encouraged others to do the same, his goals were more ambitious, and he was explicitly opposed to reductionism in social psychological theory. He was mindful of the scope and magnitude of North American social psychology and what it had achieved in defining the   in the 20th century. However, he was convinced that a European perspective could offer something different and valuable. He argued that North American social psychologists were mostly reductionist, even myopic, in their pursuit of psychological laws that applied primarily to individuals rather than to groups. In contrast, Europe’s political history and wars created a need for theoretical constructs that were embedded in social groups.

Content: Cruel and fickle, passionate and vindictive, jealous and insecure, petty and insane: the inhabitants of Mount Olympus represent an attempt by the ancient Greeks to explain the chaos of the universe through human nature. Thus, like every deity invented before and since, these gods and goddesses are embodiments of human solipsism. (Of course lightning is caused by a giant, angry man in the sky…obvi. I mean, what else could it be?) The stories of their battles, bickering, and sexual conquests have indelibly influenced the course of Western language and narrative.

When Zeus accidentally killed her, he sewed the young Dionysus into his thigh and, when the young god emerged, passed him to the care of the maenads.

The chilly lord of the underworld was among the few Greek gods to come across as dispassionate.

Content: ,  Process of registering sensory stimuli as meaningful experience. The differences between sensation and perception have varied according to how the terms are defined. A common distinction is that sensations are simple sensory experiences, while percepts are complex constructions of simple elements joined through association. Another is that perception is more subject to the influence of learning. Though hearing, smell, touch, and taste perceptions have all been explored, vision has received the most attention. Structuralist researchers such as Edward Bradford Titchener focused on the constituent elements of visual perceptions, whereas Gestalt psychology has stressed the need to examine organized wholes, believing humans are disposed to identifying patterns. Visual objects tend to appear stable despite continually changing stimulus features (such as ambient light, perspective, ground vs. figure arrangement), which enables an observer to match a perceived object with the object as it is understood to exist. Perceptions may be influenced by expectations, needs, unconscious ideas, values, and conflicts.

(born March 12, 1685, near Dysert Castle, near Thomastown?, County  , Ireland—died January 14, 1753,  , England) was an Anglo-Irish Anglican  ,  , and scientist best known for his empiricist and idealist  , which holds that reality consists only of minds and their ideas; everything save the spiritual exists only insofar as it is   by the  . Berkeley was the eldest son of William Berkeley, described as a “gentleman” in George’s matriculation entry and as a commissioned officer, a cornet of dragoons, in the entry of a younger brother. Brought up at Dysert Castle, Berkeley entered Kilkenny College in 1696 and  , Dublin, in 1700, where he graduated with a B.A. degree in 1704. While awaiting a fellowship vacancy, he made a critical study of  ,  , and the   that there is no material substance. The principal influences upon his   were  , represented by the English philosopher  , and Continental  , represented by  . His first publication,   and   (published together in 1707), was probably a fellowship thesis. Elected fellow of Trinity College in 1707, Berkeley began to “examine and revise” his “first arguings” in his revision notebooks. The revision was drastic and its results revolutionary. His old principle was largely superseded by his new principle; i.e., his original line of   for immaterialism, based on the   of  ,  , and the other    , was replaced by a simple, profound analysis of the meaning of “ ” or “to exist.” “To be,” said of the  , means to be perceived; “to be,” said of the subject, means to perceive. In what came to be known as the “master argument,” Berkeley called attention to the situation that exists when a person perceives something or imagines it. He argued that, when a person imagines trees or books “and no body by to perceive them,” he is failing to appreciate the whole situation: he is “omitting” the perceiver, for imagined trees or books are necessarily imagined as perceivable. The situation for him is a two-term relation of perceiver and perceived; there is no third term, an “  of” the object, coming between perceiver and perceived. Elsewhere he argued that, because “all sensible objects” are things “we perceive by sense,” and because nothing is perceived “besides our own ideas,” it follows that all sensible objects are ideas. The revision was a gradual development. At the start Berkeley held that nothing exists but “conscious things.” “On second thoughts,” he was certain of the existence of bodies and knew intuitively “the existence of other things besides ourselves.” His expressions, “in the  ” and “without the mind,” must be understood accordingly. As he wrote in his notebook,   and colour (which philosophers had classed as secondary qualities because of their supposed subjectivity) are “as much without the mind” as figure and   (classed as primary qualities) or as time. For both primary and secondary qualities are in the mind in such a way as to be in the thing and are in the thing in such a way as to be in the mind. The mind does not become red, blue, or extended when those qualities are in it; they are not modes or attributes of mind. Colour and extension are not mental qualities for Berkeley: colour can be seen, and extension can be touched; they are “sensible ideas,” or  , the direct objects of percipient mind. Berkeley accepted possible   as well as actual perception; i.e., he accepted the existence of what a person is not actually perceiving but might perceive if he took the appropriate steps. The opposite view was held by some philosophers, including  , who in Berkeley’s words “are by their own principles forced” to accept it. They are forced to accept that objects actually seen and touched have only an   existence, that they come into existence when perceived and pass into nothingness when no longer perceived. Berkeley treated those views with respect: he denied that they are absurd. But he did not hold them, and he explicitly denied that they follow from his principles. In effect he said to his readers, “You may hold, if you will, that objects of sense have only an ‘in-and-out’  , that they are created and   with every turn of man’s attention; but do not father those views on me. I do not hold them.” In his notebook he wrote, “Existence is   or   The horse is in the stable, the Books are in the study as before.” Horse and books, when not being actually perceived by any person, are still there, still perceivable, “still with relation to perception.” To a nonphilosophical friend Berkeley wrote, “I question not the existence of anything that we perceive by our senses.” Berkeley’s immaterialism is open to “gross misinterpretation,” as he said in his preface; rightly understood, it is common sense. Like most people, he accepted and built on “two heads,” “two kinds entirely distinct and heterogeneous”: (1) active mind or spirit, perceiving, thinking, and willing, and (2) passive objects of mind, namely sensible ideas (sense-data) or imaginable ideas.

Content: Dividing history into decades is an arbitrary but sometimes very useful way of trying to understand the arcs and significance of events. Trying to identify any single event as crucial to the understanding of a given decade may be even more arbitrary. It is certainly subjective. Nevertheless, that attempt can at the very least be a catalyst for discussion. What follows is an attempt to identify decade-defining moments in the history of the United States since the country’s inception. The centrality of the   (1776) to the developments of the 1770s is self-evident. From the   to the “ ,”  , and the  , the  ’s pursuit of liberty was made meaningful by the founding document of the great American experiment in democracy. With the war won, independence secured, and the   proving inadequate, the   laid down the law by which the new country would be governed in the elegantly crafted  , which, depending on one’s perspective, was meant either to evolve to meet changing circumstances or to be strictly interpreted to adhere to the Founders’ “original intent.” As the new country began finding its feet, U.S. President   sent troops to western Pennsylvania in 1794 to quell the  , an uprising by citizens who refused to pay a liquor tax that had been imposed by Secretary of Treasury   to raise money for the national debt and to assert the power of the national government.   cheered the triumph of national authority, while members of  ’s Republican (later  ) Party were appalled by what they saw as government overreach. More than two centuries later, the names and faces have changed, but the story is ongoing. The Louisiana Territory, the huge swath of land (more than 800,000 square miles) that made up the western   basin, passed from French colonial rule to Spanish colonial rule and then back to the French before U.S. President Thomas Jefferson pried it away from   in 1803 for a final price of some $27 million. Out of it were carved—in their entirety—the states of Louisiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Oklahoma along with most of Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Minnesota. Exploring the land acquired through the   gave   something to do for two years. On January 8, 1815, a ragtag army under the command of   decisively defeated British forces in the Battle of New Orleans, even though the   had actually already ended. News of the   (December 24, 1814) had yet to reach the combatants. The American victory made a national figure of future president Jackson and contributed to the widespread perception that the U.S. had won the war, but in truth the conflict was effectively a draw, and the issues that had brought it on were largely unresolved. The   (roughly 1815–25), a period of American prosperity and isolationism, was in full swing when U.S. President   articulated a set of principles in 1823 that decades later would be called the  . According to the policy, the United States would not intervene in European affairs, but likewise it would not tolerate further European colonization in the Americas or European interference in the governments of the American hemisphere. It is questionable whether the U.S. at the time had the might to back up its swagger, but later, as a world power, it would implement a broad interpretation of the doctrine in its “sphere of influence.” , U.S. president from 1829 to 1837, was said to have ushered in the Era of the Common Man. But while suffrage had been broadly expanded beyond men of property, it was not a result of Jackson’s efforts. Despite the careful propagation of his image as a champion of popular democracy and as a man of the people, he was much more likely to align himself with the influential than with the have-nots, with the creditor than with the debtor.   talked a good game for people on the street but delivered little. Signed on February 2, 1848, the   brought to a close the   (1846–48) and seemingly fulfilled the   of the United States championed by President   by adding 525,000 square miles of formerly Mexican land to the U.S. territory. The 1850s were awash in harbingers of the  —from the  , which temporarily forestalled North-South tensions, to  ’s  , which ramped them up. Arguably, though, by stoking abolitionist indignation in an increasingly polarized country, the  ’s   set the table for the   of   as president, which ultimately precipitated   and war. In July 1863, the year of the  , in the small Pennsylvania crossroads town of  ,  ’s invading Army of Northern Virginia sustained   so devastating that it sealed the fate of the   and its “ .” Within two years the war was over, and before the end of the decade the South was temporarily transformed by  . While the country celebrated its anniversary at the  , on June 25, 1876, the 7th Cavalry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel   was vanquished by Lakota and Northern Cheyenne warriors led by   in the  . Although it was a major victory for the Northern Plains people against U.S. expansionism, the battle marked the beginning of the end of   sovereignty over the West. The wealth-concentrating practices of the “ ,” who oversaw the burst of industrial activity and corporate growth during the   of the late 19th century, was countered by the rise of   led by the  . However, when a protest meeting related to one of the nearly 1,600 strikes conducted during 1886 was disrupted by the explosion of a bomb that killed seven policemen at the   in Chicago, many people blamed the violence on organized labor, which went into decline until the turn of the century. With the end of   in the 1870s, the enactment of   enforced   in the South. In its 7–1 decision in the   case in May 1896, the   gave constitutional sanction to laws designed to achieve racial segregation by means of separate and supposedly equal public facilities and services for   and whites, thus providing a controlling judicial precedent that would endure until the 1950s. In 1902 U.S. President   pursued the   goal of curbing the enormous economic and political power of the giant corporate trusts by resurrecting the nearly defunct   to bring a lawsuit that led to the breakup of a huge railroad conglomerate, the Northern Securities Company (ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1904). Roosevelt pursued this policy of “trust-busting” by initiating suits against 43 other major corporations during the next seven years. As   raged in Europe, most Americans, including U.S. President  , remained determined to avoid involvement and committed to neutrality, though the U.S. economy had benefited greatly from supplying food, raw material, and guns and ammunition to the Allies. More than any other single event, the sinking of the unarmed British ocean liner, the  , by a German submarine on May 7, 1915 (killing, among others, 128 Americans), prompted the U.S. to join the war on the side of the Allies. Leaving behind its isolationism, the U.S. became a global superpower, though by decade’s end it would recoil from membership in the fledgling  . “The chief business of the American people is business,” U.S. President   said in 1925. And with the American economy humming during the “Roaring Twenties” (the Jazz Age), peace and prosperity reigned in the United States…until it didn’t. The era came to a close in October 1929 when the  , setting the stage for years of economic deprivation and calamity during the  . In 1933 at least one-fourth of the U.S. workforce was unemployed when the administration of President   first took on the ravages of the Great Depression with the  , a federal government program that sought to bring about immediate economic relief as well as reforms in industry, agriculture, finance, labor, and housing. On March 12, 1933, Roosevelt gave the first in a long series (1933–44) of straightforward informal radio addresses, the  , which were initially intended to garner support for the New Deal but eventually contributed to reformulating the American social mentality from one of despair to one of hope during a time of multiple crises, including the Great Depression and  . Having again stayed out of the initial stages of a worldwide conflict, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the   following the   (December 1941). In August 1945, with the war in Europe over and U.S. forces advancing on  , U.S. President   ushered in the nuclear era by choosing to drop   on  , Japan, in the hope that the terrible destruction unleashed would prevent the even greater loss of life that seemed likely with a protracted island-by-island invasion of Japan. With the   as a backdrop, U.S. Senator   gave his name to an era ( ) by fanning the flames of anticommunist hysteria with sensational but unproven charges of communist subversion in high government circles, while the   investigated alleged communist activities in the entertainment industry. McCarthy’s influence waned in 1954 when a   on his charges of subversion by U.S. Army officers and civilian officials exposed his brutal interrogative tactics. At the center of the widespread social and political upheaval of the 1960s were the  , opposition to the  , the emergence of a youth-oriented counterculture, and the establishment and reactionary elements that pushed back against change. The April 4, 1968,  , the most prominent civil rights leader, revealed the tragic, violent consequences that could result from a country’s political polarization. On August 9, 1974—facing likely   for his role in covering up the   in Washington, D.C., in June 1972—Republican   became the only U.S. president to resign. The loss of faith in government officials that resulted from the scandal suffused both popular and political culture with paranoia and disillusionment for the remainder of the decade. U.S. President  ’s triumph over the strike by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) in August 1981 played a pivotal role in the long-term weakening of the power of labor unions and helped set the tenor for his administration. Reagan’s ascent to the presidency in 1980 had much to do with his rhetorical ability to break the cloud of gloom caused by Watergate. This abetted his efforts to implement supply-side ( ) economic policies predicated on the notion that lower taxes on wealthy “job creators” would create a rising tide that would lift all boats. Critics argued that the wealth created during the decade never “trickled down” to the rank and file. Although terrorist attacks had been directed at the United States at the end of the 20th century, a new sense of vulnerability was introduced into American life on  , when Islamist terrorists crashed hijacked planes into the   in New York City, the   in Washington, D.C., and the  , resulting in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. Since at least the 1980s, the U.S. had been politically polarized by so-called culture wars that symbolically divided the country into Republican-dominated “red states” (typically characterized as conservative, God-fearing, and opposed to big government, abortion, and same-sex marriage) and Democrat-dominated “blue states” (theoretically liberal, secular, politically correct, and for legal abortion access). The 2016 election of Republican  —whose presidential campaign was grounded in nationalism and anti-immigrant rhetoric—could been seen then as a reaction against the seeming triumph of blue-state values during the two-term presidency (2009–17) of the United States’ first African American president, Democrat  .  In early 2020, life in the United States and around the world was turned upside down by the arrival of the   global  . For more than two years, preventive measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, mask wearing, and vaccine passports became the “new normal,” as local and national governments sought to prevent the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome   2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, the potentially deadly disease that claimed more than one million American lives by May 2022.

For example, spectacles containing a wedge prism will bend light rays to displace images on the retina. An object thus will be seen as if it were somewhere other than its ordinarily perceived position.

Content: The   came to national prominence in the United States during the mid-1950s and continued to challenge racial segregation and discrimination through the 1960s. Many organizations, notably the  , headed by  , the  , and the  , arranged nonviolent demonstrations to call attention to specific inequalities experienced by Black people, while individuals also challenged unjust laws independently. The civil rights movement eventually achieved equal rights legislation, but not without challenges. In the late 1960s complications arose as various groups confronted the enduring economic and social consequences of past oppression. These problems persisted in subsequent decades, and the idea of real equality remained elusive well into the 21st century. Nonetheless, the intrepid supporters of the civil rights movement took some of the hardest first steps toward equality. On May 17, 1954, the   ruled in the case   that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. The decision effectively overturned the “separate but equal” ruling of   (1896), which had allowed   that mandated separate public facilities for white and Black Americans to prevail throughout the South during the first half of the 20th century. While the   ruling applied only to schools, it implied that segregation in other public facilities was unconstitutional as well. On December 1, 1955, African American civil rights activist   refused to give up her seat on a public bus to a white passenger. Her subsequent arrest initiated a sustained bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. The protest began on December 5, led by  , then a young local pastor, and was so successful that it was extended indefinitely. In the ensuing months, protestors faced threats, arrests, and termination from their jobs. Nonetheless, the boycott continued for more than a year. Finally, the   upheld a lower court’s ruling that segregated seating was unconstitutional, and the federal decision went into effect on December 20, 1956. In September 1957 nine African American students attended their first day at Little Rock Central High School, whose entire student population had until that point been white. The  , as they came to be called, encountered a large white mob and soldiers from the Arkansas National Guard, sent by Arkansas Gov.  , blocking the entrance of the school. For the next 18 days Pres.  , Gov. Faubus, and Little Rock’s mayor, Woodrow Mann, discussed the situation. The Little Rock Nine returned on September 23, but were met with violence. The students were sent home and returned on September 25, protected by U.S. soldiers. Although the students were continually harassed, eight of the nine completed the academic year. The entire confrontation drew international attention not only to civil rights in the United States but also to the struggle between federal and state power. On February 1, 1960, a group of four African American students from the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina (now North Carolina A&T State University), a historically Black college, began a sit-in movement in downtown Greensboro. After making purchases at the F.W. Woolworth department store, they sat at the “whites only” lunch counter. They were refused service and eventually asked to leave. The  , as they came to be called, however, remained seated until closing and returned the next day with about 20 other Black students. The sit-in grew in the following weeks with protestors taking every seat in the establishment and spilling out of the store. As protestors were arrested, others would take their places so that the establishment was unceasingly occupied. The protest spread to other cities, including Atlanta and Nashville. After months of protests, facilities began to desegregate throughout the country, and the Greensboro Woolworth’s started to serve African American patrons in July. On November 14, 1960, six-year-old   was escorted to her first day at the previously all-white William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans by four armed federal marshals. They were met with angry mobs shouting their disapproval, and, throughout the day, parents marched in to remove their children from the school as a protest to desegregation. Every subsequent day of that academic year Bridges was escorted to school, enduring insults and threats on her way, and then learning her lessons from her young teacher, Barbara Henry, in an otherwise empty classroom. Her bravery later inspired the Norman Rockwell painting   (1964). The   began on May 4, 1961, with a group of seven African Americans and six white people who boarded two buses bound for New Orleans. Testing the  ’s ruling on the case   v.   (1960), which extended an earlier ruling banning segregated interstate bus travel (1946) to include bus terminals and restrooms, the Freedom Riders used facilities for the opposite race as their buses made stops along the way. The group was confronted by violence in South Carolina, and, on May 14, when one bus stopped to change a slashed tire, the vehicle was firebombed and the Freedom Riders were beaten. Unable to travel farther, the original riders were replaced by a second group of 10, partly organized by the  , originating in Nashville. As riders were either arrested or beaten, more groups of Freedom Riders would take their place. On May 29 U.S. Attorney General   ordered the   to enforce bans on segregation more strictly, an edict that took effect in September. In the spring of 1963,  , and the   launched a campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, with local Pastor   and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) to undermine the city’s system of racial segregation. The campaign began on April 3, 1963, with  , economic boycotts, mass protests, and marches on City Hall. The demonstrations faced challenges from many sides, including an indifferent African American community, adversarial white and Black leaders, and a hostile commissioner of public safety, Eugene (“Bull”) Connor. On April 12 King was arrested for violating an anti-protest injunction and placed in solitary confinement. The demonstrations continued, but, after a month without any concessions, King was convinced to launch the Children’s Crusade. Beginning on May 2, 1963, school-aged volunteers skipped school and began to march. Many submitted politely to arrests, and local jails quickly filled up. On May 3 Connor ordered the police and fire department to set high-pressure water hoses and attack dogs on protesters. The violent tactics against peaceful demonstrators continued in ensuing days, causing outrage in the community, and gaining national attention. The negative media spurred Pres.   to propose a civil rights bill on June 11. Although the Birmingham campaign eventually negotiated an agreement with local reforms, tensions remained high in the city, and the meeting places of civil rights activists were continually threatened. A bomb on September 15 at   killed four African American girls and injured 14 others. The demonstrations of 1963 culminated with the   for Jobs and Freedom on August 28 to protest civil rights abuses and employment discrimination. A crowd of about 250,000 individuals gathered peacefully on the   in Washington, D.C., to listen to speeches by civil rights leaders, notably  . He addressed the crowd with an eloquent and uplifting message that famously became known as the “ ” speech. On July 2, 1964, Pres.  , signed the   into law, a stronger version of what his predecessor, President  , had proposed the previous summer before his   in November 1963. The act authorized the federal government to prevent racial discrimination in employment, voting, and the use of public facilities. Although controversial, the legislation was a victory for the civil rights movement. On February 21, 1965, the prominent Black leader   was assassinated while lecturing at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem, New York. An eloquent orator, Malcolm X spoke out on the civil rights movement, demanding it move beyond civil rights to human rights, and argued that the solution to racial problems was in orthodox Islam. His speeches and ideas contributed to the development of   ideology and the  . On March 7, 1965,  , organized a march from Selma, Alabama, to the state’s capital, Montgomery, to call for a federal voting rights law that would provide legal support for disenfranchised African Americans in the South. State troopers, however, sent marchers back with violence and tear gas, and television cameras recorded the incident. On March 9 King tried again, leading more than 2,000 marchers to the Pettus Bridge, where they encountered a barricade of state troopers. King led his followers to kneel in prayer and then he unexpectedly turned back. The media attention prompted President   to introduce voting rights legislation on March 15, and on March 21  ; this time, they were protected by Alabama National Guardsmen, federal marshals, and FBI agents. Marchers arrived in Montgomery on March 25, where King addressed the crowd with what would be called his “How Long, Not Long” speech. The   was signed into law several months later, on August 6. It suspended literacy tests, provided for federal approval of proposed changes to voting laws or procedures, and directed the attorney general of the United States to challenge the use of poll taxes for state and local elections. A series of violent confrontations between the city police and residents of Watts and other predominantly African American neighborhoods of Los Angeles began on August 11, 1965, after a white police officer arrested a Black man, Marquette Frye, on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Later accounts indicated that Frye resisted arrest but were unclear whether police had used excessive force. Violence, fires, and looting broke out over the next six days. The   resulted in 34 deaths, more than 1,000 injuries, and $40 million in property damage. The McCone Commission later investigated the causes of the riots and concluded that they were not the work of gangs or the Black Muslim movement, as the media had previously suggested. The violence was more directly a reaction to the great economic challenges that African Americans in urban centers faced: poor housing, schools, and job prospects that civil rights legislation had not improved. In the wake of the assassination of   and urban uprisings,   and   founded the   in Oakland, California, to protect African American neighborhoods from  . The   launched numerous community programs that offered such services as tuberculosis testing, legal aid, transportation assistance, and free shoes to disadvantaged people. The programs confronted the economic problems of African Americans, which the party argued the civil rights reforms did not do enough to address. The Black Panthers’ socialist viewpoint, however, made them a target of the  ’s counterintelligence program ( ), which accused them of being a communist organization and an enemy of the U.S. government. A campaign to annihilate the group came to a head in December 1969 with a police shoot-out at the group’s Southern California headquarters and the killing of   and another Panther during an Illinois state police raid. The Black Panther Party’s operations, however, continued into the 1970s, albeit less actively. On June 12, 1967, the   declared the Virginia statutes prohibiting interracial marriage unconstitutional in the case  . The case was decided nine years after Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Jeter, a woman of mixed African American and Native American ancestry, had pleaded guilty to having violated Virginia state law prohibiting a white person and a “colored” person from leaving the state to be married and returning to live as man and wife. Their one-year prison sentence was suspended on the condition that the couple leave Virginia and not return as husband and wife for 25 years. Once settled in Washington, D.C., the couple filed suit in a Virginia state court in 1963. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which reversed their conviction. Chief Justice   wrote for a unanimous court that the freedom to marry was a basic civil right and that to deny that freedom based on the groundless classifications outlined in Virginia state’s law was “to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law.” The ruling thus invalidated laws against interracial marriage in Virginia and 15 other states. A series of violent confrontations between residents of predominantly Black neighborhoods and city police in Detroit began on July 23, 1967, after a raid at an illegal drinking club where police arrested everyone inside, including 82 African Americans. Nearby residents protested, and some began to vandalize property, loot businesses, and start fires for the next five days. The   spread to other parts of the city and resulted in 43 deaths, hundreds of injuries, more than 7,000 arrests, and 1,000 burned buildings. As the disturbances continued, President   appointed a   (the Kerner Commission) to investigate recent urban uprisings. It concluded that racism, discrimination, and poverty were some of the causes of the violence and warned that “our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.” On April 4, 1968,   by a sniper while standing on the second-floor balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He had been staying at the hotel after leading a nonviolent demonstration in support of striking sanitation workers in that city. His murder set off riots in hundreds of cities across the country, and it also pushed   to pass the stalled   in King’s honor on April 11. The legislation made it unlawful for sellers, landlords, and financial institutions to refuse to rent, sell, or provide financing for a dwelling based on factors other than an individual’s financial resources. After that victory, some of King’s supporters carried on his activities, including staging the Poor People’s March in Washington, D.C., that spring. The civil rights movement, however, seemed to be shifting away from the nonviolent tactics and interracial cooperation that had brought about a number of policy changes. The changes, however, could not overcome deep-seated discrimination and the economic oppression that prevented real equality.

As described above, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services and Games, we work with third-party service providers, advertisers and advertising networks that use cookies and other similar technologies to target ads served to our free, ad-supported Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data that you provide directly to advertisers or third-party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser’s or third party partner’s privacy policy. What does it mean to “serve ads”? When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a “request” to the computer that hosts the website (the “host server”) requesting that server to send you (or “serve”) the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and advertising networks to whom we have sold the ad spaces. These advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (“targeting”). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the advertising network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as “behavioral advertising.” Britannica does not provide any personal information to third-party service providers, such as Raptive, advertisers or advertising networks about visitors to the Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that may have been collected from you by third parties on other websites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit  . Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at  . Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below.

Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technological standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals.

Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we: However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of personally identifiable student data required for the setup of the system is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including personally identifiable student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization, which acknowledges that we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and that once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. That aggregated, non-personally identifiable data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties to provide products and do not share your student data with any third parties. Britannica is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure.

We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We strive to restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we strive to ensure that all our employees are aware of the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information.

The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. You have the right to request that the Company disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you: You have the right to request that the Company delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either: Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must: We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing in accordance with CCPA requirements. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.  We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by emailing  . Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clearing cookies from your browser or emailing  .  You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not: However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.  Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

Content:   The most direct examination of perceptual learning is provided by investigating the effects of practice. In so-called detection tasks the observer is required to detect the presence or absence of a selected stimulus. For example, effects of practice on visual acuity were studied by requiring observers to detect simple orientation (left or right) in a row of leaning letters; e.g., . Practice tended to lower acuity thresholds, defined as the lowest intensity of illumination at which each observer could detect the orientation. Or, observers were asked to say when they just could see that an approaching pair of parallel bars  ...(100 of 9427 words)

URL: https://www.britannica.com/story/what-is-a-cashless-society-and-how-does-it-work

Content: A cashless society is one in which  , in the form of physical banknotes and  , is not accepted in any financial transaction. Instead, people and businesses transfer   to one another digitally—via   or   cards, electronic money transfers,  , or online and mobile payment services, such as   and Apple Pay. Although no existing society is cashless, many economists believe that consumer preferences, competitive pressures on businesses, profit seeking by  , and government policies designed to facilitate cashless transactions will soon lead to at least a few cashless societies. There are various measures of cashlessness, yielding different rankings of countries along a “cashless continuum,” but most experts agree that Sweden is now closest to the cashless ideal. Cash is now used in less than 15 percent of transactions in that country, and the value of cash in circulation has declined significantly in the 21st century, now representing about 1 percent of GDP. Swedish retailers and restaurants are now permitted to refuse cash payments merely by posting a sign, and more than half of all Swedish bank branches no longer handle cash. To facilitate the transition to cashlessness,   in some countries have introduced government-backed digital   to replace or complement banknotes and coins. Proponents of a cashless society argue that digital transactions are more convenient for both customers and businesses and that cashlessness would cut down on many criminal activities. They also maintain that the trend toward cashlessness is unstoppable, given the increasing digitization of economies and consumers’ growing preference for conducting daily business with mobile devices. The trend has been propelled, however, by banks that have intentionally made cash transactions less convenient for their customers (e.g., by closing branches and removing ATMs) to encourage the use of digital services that are more profitable. The global coronavirus pandemic that began in 2020 also contributed heavily to an increase in touchless and cashless transactions. But there are potential drawbacks to a cashless society. First, it would largely exclude “unbanked” (mostly poor) persons, who do not use or cannot obtain a bank account. Second, it could invite serious breaches of  , because few purchases and sales would be anonymous. Third, even minor technological glitches could block access to funds, and systemic failures due to natural disasters or massive hacking could make all purchases and payments impossible. Fourth, during a severe economic crisis threatening the solvency of major banks, depositors would be unable to rescue their money by withdrawing it in cash. Nor could depositors prevent troubled banks from taking a portion of their deposits in “bail-in” scenarios, under which the institution’s shareholders and creditors, including depositors, are held responsible for its debts (in the U.S., up to $250,000 of each deposit would be protected from such seizures). Finally, ordinary depositors would not be able to protect themselves from negative   rates, which central banks in some countries (e.g., Japan) have imposed to combat   or deflation after cuts in positive interest rates to near zero have failed. Negative interest rates permit private banks to charge depositors what amounts to a fee for holding their money, thus encouraging them to spend and invest. Indeed, some economists consider that to be an argument in favor of a cashless society, as it would make painfully deep negative interest rates workable because they could not be avoided through cash withdrawals.

Content: ,  Process of registering sensory stimuli as meaningful experience. The differences between sensation and perception have varied according to how the terms are defined. A common distinction is that sensations are simple sensory experiences, while percepts are complex constructions of simple elements joined through association. Another is that perception is more subject to the influence of learning. Though hearing, smell, touch, and taste perceptions have all been explored, vision has received the most attention. Structuralist researchers such as Edward Bradford Titchener focused on the constituent elements of visual perceptions, whereas Gestalt psychology has stressed the need to examine organized wholes, believing humans are disposed to identifying patterns. Visual objects tend to appear stable despite continually changing stimulus features (such as ambient light, perspective, ground vs. figure arrangement), which enables an observer to match a perceived object with the object as it is understood to exist. Perceptions may be influenced by expectations, needs, unconscious ideas, values, and conflicts.

Content:   Even though the retinal image of a receding automobile shrinks in size, the normal, experienced person perceives the size of the object to remain constant. Indeed, one of the most impressive features of perceiving is the tendency of objects to appear stable in the face of their continually changing stimulus features. Though a dinner plate itself does not change, its image on the retina undergoes considerable changes in shape and size as the perceiver and plate move. What is noteworthy is stability in perception despite gross instability in stimulation. Such matches between the object as it is perceived and the  ...(100 of 9427 words)

Opting out from DigiTrust will stop DigiTrust Partners from using the DigiTrust identifier. Through the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners. Our ad-supported Services and Games may also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this:  ) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers – doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.  Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc. and its group companies (‘LiveRamp’).

If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again. Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site’s visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads. Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. As described above, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services and Games, we work with third-party service providers, advertisers and advertising networks that use cookies and other similar technologies to target ads served to our free, ad-supported Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data that you provide directly to advertisers or third-party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser’s or third party partner’s privacy policy. What does it mean to “serve ads”? When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a “request” to the computer that hosts the website (the “host server”) requesting that server to send you (or “serve”) the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and advertising networks to whom we have sold the ad spaces. These advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (“targeting”). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the advertising network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as “behavioral advertising.” Britannica does not provide any personal information to third-party service providers, such as Raptive, advertisers or advertising networks about visitors to the Services. Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that may have been collected from you by third parties on other websites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit  . Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at  . Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive a “opt-out” cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future.  .

If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider.  This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technological standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals.  If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services. If we discover that we have collected any personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 16 without the proper consents required by law, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible. Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Britannica has any information from or about anyone under 16, please email us at  . In general, if you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student service data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant. As you use the Institutional Services, you may enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered. Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we: However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site. You control what student data is entered on our Kids’ Service or Institutional Services and you always retain ownership of the student data. Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance. We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose. Therefore, only a minimum amount of personally identifiable student data required for the setup of the system is requested. Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name. We will use the student data to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Services to your school institution. We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it. We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization. When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including personally identifiable student data, from a third-party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution. Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us. Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing. We will do so with written authorization, which acknowledges that we are providing that data as the requesting institution’s agent and that once the data is received by the third party, we no longer have any control over the use or disposition of the data. We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing. That aggregated, non-personally identifiable data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. If we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication. We do not utilize third parties to provide products and do not share your student data with any third parties. Britannica is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure. Any personal information collected through the Services is stored on limited-access servers. We maintain a comprehensive information security program and seek to use commercially reasonable organizational, physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect these servers and the information they store from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss or modification. Our security measures include (among others): encryption of data; security controls that protect the entirety of Britannica’s IT infrastructure from external attack and unauthorized access; and internal policies setting out our data security approach and training for employees, including a Data Breach Notification Policy. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis.

Content:   One of the simplest instance of relational (or context) effects in perception is that of brightness contrast. Thus, the apparent brightness of a stimulus depends not only on its own luminance but also on that of the surrounding stimulation. The same gray square looks whiter against a dark background and blacker when placed in a bright surround. Similarly, a white or gray patch will take on an apparent hue that is complementary to the colour of the surround (e.g., the patch will seem tinged with yellow when it is placed against a blue background).

Content:     Gestalt theory was meant to have general applicability; its main tenets, however, were induced almost exclusively from observations on visual perception. Whatever their ultimate theoretical significance, these observations have been raised to the level of general principles. It is conventional to refer to them as Gestalt principles of perceptual organization.  The overriding theme of the theory is that stimulation is perceived in organized or configurational terms (  in German means “configuration”). Patterns take precedence over elements and have properties that are not inherent in the elements themselves. One does not merely perceive dots; he perceives a dotted line. This notion  ...(100 of 9427 words)

Content:   In a theory called structuralism, that everyday perceptual experience is structured or synthesized from “sensations,” psychologists such as the English-U.S. introspectionistic psychologist Edward Bradford Titchener even devised a formal method of introspection for experimentally analyzing (or taking apart) percepts in an effort to reveal their constituent elements. The procedure required that the introspecting experimental subjects learn to avoid reporting on their experiences as they naıvely seemed. To establish this way of treating experience required careful training. One consequence of this training is that the observer’s introspective reports may be contaminated by his expectations and hence may, in all honesty, reflect  ...(100 of 9427 words)

Content:   Striking examples of perceptual learning are observed when one receives sensory data that contradict earlier experiences. For example, spectacles containing a wedge prism will bend light rays to displace images on the retina. An object thus will be seen as if it were somewhere other than its ordinarily perceived position. The subject’s initial attempts to touch the target will be misdirected, and there is a discrepancy between its location as seen and as felt. A right-angle prism will tilt the visual scene to any desired degree, altering the customary direction in which retinal images move. Usually, images of stationary objects  ...(100 of 9427 words)

Content:     The organization apparent in percepts has been attributed by some to learning, as being built up through arbitrary associations of elements that have repeatedly occurred together in the person’s experience. Other theorists (particularly Gestaltists) stress the view that perceptual organization is physiologically inborn, being inherent in innate aspects of brain functioning rather than depending on a synthesizing process of learning to combine simpler elements into more complex, integrated wholes. One way of resolving such theoretical disputes would be to deprive people from birth of all visual sensory experience and, hence, of all opportunity for visual perceptual learning. Then at the  ...(100 of 9427 words)

Content:     Many philosophers and psychologists have commonly accepted as fundamental a distinction made on rational grounds between sensing and perceiving (or between sensations and percepts). To demonstrate empirically that sensing and perceiving are indeed different, however, is quite another matter. It is often said, for example, that sensations are simple and that percepts are complex. Yet, only if there is offered some agreed upon (a priori) basis for separating experiences into two categories—sensations and percepts—can experimental procedures demonstrate that the items in one category are “simpler” than those in the other. Clearly, the arbitrary basis for the initial categorization itself cannot  ...(100 of 9427 words)

Content:   The most direct examination of perceptual learning is provided by investigating the effects of practice. In so-called detection tasks the observer is required to detect the presence or absence of a selected stimulus. For example, effects of practice on visual acuity were studied by requiring observers to detect simple orientation (left or right) in a row of leaning letters; e.g., . Practice tended to lower acuity thresholds, defined as the lowest intensity of illumination at which each observer could detect the orientation. Or, observers were asked to say when they just could see that an approaching pair of parallel bars  ...(100 of 9427 words)

Indeed, one of the most impressive features of perceiving is the tendency of objects to appear stable in the face of their continually changing stimulus features. Though a dinner plate itself does not change, its image on the retina undergoes considerable changes in shape and size as the perceiver and plate move. What is noteworthy is stability in perception despite gross instability in stimulation. Such matches between the object as it is perceived and the  ...(100 of 9427 words)

The word, brought into English from the Greek  , was for some time most commonly used roughly in the technical sense given to it by   in his  . By the 17th century it had come to be used more or less in its modern sense of “thought,” “concept,” “belief,” “intention,” or “plan.” In the 17th and 18th centuries, the word “idea” was in very general use as a technical term of  , not with its   meaning, but in a variety of senses mostly traceable to  , some of which were derived by him from  . In his  , Locke introduces it first as “that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a   thinks” and later as signifying “the immediate object of  ,  , or understanding.” This vague usage leads him into serious difficulties. In the first place, he holds that ideas are “in the mind”; so that, if ideas are said to be the objects of perception, he is faced with the problem of explaining how perception could lead to knowledge of the “external” world. Secondly, he is led to overlook the important respects in which thinking and understanding must be distinguished from perception: he speaks indeed as if thinking and understanding really are essentially forms of perception, or as if all three consisted alike in “having ideas.”  retained the word “idea,” for which he sometimes used “sensation” as a  , to stand for the objects of perception. He retained the view that ideas are “in the mind,” and he sought to evade the problem which Locke had failed to solve—the problem of basing knowledge of the material world on perception of mind-dependent ideas—by refusing to draw any distinction between ideas and material objects. Material objects, he held, are “collections” of ideas, and hence they too can exist “only in the mind.”  introduced a distinction between ideas and impressions—the latter term being designed to cover “all our sensations, passions, and emotions,” the former “the faint images of these in thinking and reasoning.” In so doing, however, he did not much improve upon Locke: he still held that the objects of perception are “in the mind” and for the most part he retained in his account of thinking the fatally misleading   with perception. It was urged by an early critic,  , that most of the perplexities in which Locke, Berkeley, and Hume had been entangled arose from initial confusions in the use of the word “idea,” for which Reid thought Descartes ultimately responsible. Even though it can hardly be adequate to trace all difficulties to this one source, it can be said that their uses of the term “idea” require very close and critical scrutiny, if their problems are to be resolved or even rightly understood.

Content: ,   in psychology, the tendency to respond in the same way to different but similar stimuli. For example, a dog conditioned to salivate to a tone of a particular pitch and loudness will also salivate with considerable regularity in response to tones of higher and lower pitch. The generalized response is predictable and orderly: it will measure less than that elicited by the original tone and will diminish as the new tone departs increasingly from the original. Similar behaviour is observed in humans, as children learning to talk may call anything that can be sat upon “chair” or any man “daddy.” Adults conditioned by mild electric shock to fear a certain word will respond with symptoms of anxiety to any synonym of that word; in this instance, physical similarity, the usual basis of generalization, is less important than prior learning. Responses may also be generalized, allowing an individual to take an alternative course of action if the usual response is for some reason precluded. Learning may be considered a balance of generalization and discrimination (the ability to respond to differences among stimuli). An imbalance can lead to negative results. For example, a child who is scared by a man with a beard may fail to discriminate between bearded men and generalize that all men with beards are to be feared.

The very nature of what it means to be   is being both enriched and challenged, as our species breaks the shackles of its genetic legacy and achieves inconceivable heights of intelligence, material progress, and longevity. The rate of this “paradigm shift” is now doubling every decade, so the 21st century will actually see 20,000 years of progress at today’s pace. Computation, communication, biological technologies (for example, DNA sequencing), brain scanning, knowledge of the human brain, and human knowledge in general are all accelerating at an even faster pace, generally doubling in performance, capacity, and bandwidth every year. Three-dimensional molecular computing will provide the hardware for human-level “strong”   well before 2030. The more important software insights will be gained in part from the reverse-engineering of the human brain, a process well under way. While the social and philosophical ramifications of these changes will be profound, and the threats they pose considerable, we will ultimately merge with our machines, live indefinitely, and be a billion times more intelligent…all within the next three to four decades. We will connect our biological   to a synthetic neocortex in the  . This will be done by using medical nano-robots that go into the brain through the capillaries and provide wireless communication between our neocortical modules and the cloud in the same way that your smartphone today has wireless communication with the cloud. And the same way that your smartphone today amplifies its capabilities by connecting to many computers in the cloud, we will do the same thing with our neocortex. This is a 2030s and 2040s scenario. Our thinking then will become a hybrid of the biological and nonbiological thinking in the cloud. As a result, we will become smarter, more musical, funnier, etc. But our thinking will become increasingly   as we extend further into the cloud and as the cloud becomes more powerful. Digital processes are inherently backed up, and we in turn will be able to back up our “  file” or at least most of it.

Content:     Gestalt theory was meant to have general applicability; its main tenets, however, were induced almost exclusively from observations on visual perception. Whatever their ultimate theoretical significance, these observations have been raised to the level of general principles. It is conventional to refer to them as Gestalt principles of perceptual organization.  The overriding theme of the theory is that stimulation is perceived in organized or configurational terms (  in German means “configuration”). Patterns take precedence over elements and have properties that are not inherent in the elements themselves. One does not merely perceive dots; he perceives a dotted line. This notion  ...(100 of 9427 words)

The very nature of what it means to be   is being both enriched and challenged, as our species breaks the shackles of its genetic legacy and achieves inconceivable heights of intelligence, material progress, and longevity. The rate of this “paradigm shift” is now doubling every decade, so the 21st century will actually see 20,000 years of progress at today’s pace. Computation, communication, biological technologies (for example, DNA sequencing), brain scanning, knowledge of the human brain, and human knowledge in general are all accelerating at an even faster pace, generally doubling in performance, capacity, and bandwidth every year. Three-dimensional molecular computing will provide the hardware for human-level “strong”   well before 2030. The more important software insights will be gained in part from the reverse-engineering of the human brain, a process well under way. While the social and philosophical ramifications of these changes will be profound, and the threats they pose considerable, we will ultimately merge with our machines, live indefinitely, and be a billion times more intelligent…all within the next three to four decades. We will connect our biological   to a synthetic neocortex in the  . This will be done by using medical nano-robots that go into the brain through the capillaries and provide wireless communication between our neocortical modules and the cloud in the same way that your smartphone today has wireless communication with the cloud. And the same way that your smartphone today amplifies its capabilities by connecting to many computers in the cloud, we will do the same thing with our neocortex. This is a 2030s and 2040s scenario. Our thinking then will become a hybrid of the biological and nonbiological thinking in the cloud. As a result, we will become smarter, more musical, funnier, etc. But our thinking will become increasingly   as we extend further into the cloud and as the cloud becomes more powerful. Digital processes are inherently backed up, and we in turn will be able to back up our “  file” or at least most of it.

Content:   In a theory called structuralism, that everyday perceptual experience is structured or synthesized from “sensations,” psychologists such as the English-U.S. introspectionistic psychologist Edward Bradford Titchener even devised a formal method of introspection for experimentally analyzing (or taking apart) percepts in an effort to reveal their constituent elements. The procedure required that the introspecting experimental subjects learn to avoid reporting on their experiences as they naıvely seemed. To establish this way of treating experience required careful training. One consequence of this training is that the observer’s introspective reports may be contaminated by his expectations and hence may, in all honesty, reflect  ...(100 of 9427 words)

Content: The   is one of the most iconic sculptures in the Western world and is often seen as a symbol of American freedom. Designed and sculpted by French sculptor  , France donated this colossal statue to the United States in 1875 to commemorate their alliance during the  . Formally titled  , the statue depicts a crowned Liberty, personified as a woman, lifting up a torch with her right hand as her left hand clutches a tablet bearing “JULY IV, MDCCLXXVI,” the Roman-numeral date on which the   was adopted. In “The New Colossus,” Emma Lazarus calls her the “Mother of Exiles,” and for Americans new and old, her image has become one of the most recognizable in the world. But what do we know about the real-life woman who inspired Lady Liberty? Answering this question requires going back in Bartholdi’s writings and sketches—not of the Statue of Liberty but of an earlier statue that bears a stark resemblance to his American monument. Bartholdi began to dabble in colossal statuary in the late 1850s, nearly 30 years before the Statue of Liberty was completed. He   as having been informed by classical monuments, like the  . The style he studied “with the greatest attention,” however, was that of the ancient Egyptians. Bartholdi journeyed to Egypt about 1856 and was awestruck at the  , two statues of the pharaoh  . At 70 feet (21 meters) tall, they had towered over the ruins of ancient Thebes for over 3,200 years. Bartholdi wrote that “these granite beings, in their imperturbable majesty, seem to be still listening to the most remote antiquity. Their kindly and impassable glance seems to ignore the present and to be fixed upon an unlimited future….[T]he design itself expresses, after a fashion, infinity.” Bartholdi’s journey to Egypt was enormously transformative and influential. In 1868 he returned to marvel again at the Colossi, and in 1869 Bartholdi submitted a colossal statuary proposal to the Egyptian  ,  . Bartholdi hoped that the khedive would use his sculpture design to commemorate the completion of the  , which had opened that year. As the shortest path between the Mediterranean and Red Seas, the Suez Canal functioned as a literal sea-bridge between Europe and Asia. If selected, Bartholdi hoped that his colossus would be seen as a symbol of cultural progress and understanding.  for the khedive was modeled after a woman  , or Egyptian peasant. Unfortunately, very little is known about this   besides her socioeconomic status; Bartholdi left no records that indicate any interest in her personal story. Despite this, selecting a woman was no accident. Bartholdi was conscious of a centuries-long European artistic tradition of personifying values, ideas, and even countries in the forms of women. These personifications were venerated and sometimes worshipped, but of particular importance for Bartholdi was that they lived and lingered in the minds of those who viewed their likenesses. This logic is clear in the name, form, and function of Bartholdi’s contest submission. Titled  , this colossal woman was to be positioned in the middle of the Suez Canal atop a monumental plinth. Dressed in what Egyptians would have recognized as the clothes of a   and immortalized as a monument, she would have been a point of pride for Egyptians of all social classes. She doubled as a lighthouse, holding a torch up high and radiating light from her head. As ships from countless nations passed beneath her, this woman was to be seen as the physical embodiment of Egypt and its progress. Although Bartholdi’s submission may have impressed the khedive, building the colossus would have been enormously expensive. Egypt was facing financial problems that likely caused the khedive to shift his attention elsewhere, and the project was terminated. But if Bartholdi’s colossal   seems recognizable, that is because he was determined to repurpose his scrapped design. Between 1870 and 1871, he began to alter the details of his sketches. The woman’s characteristic Egyptian dress gave way to Greek robes, and light beamed from her torch instead of her head. A diadem would later replace her head covering, while her left hand soon bore a tablet. But like the sketches from 1869, she still held her torch with an upstretched arm, her other limb positioned at her waist. Beneath what would become America’s   was Egypt’s own colossal  , still “carrying the light.”

To demonstrate empirically that sensing and perceiving are indeed different, however, is quite another matter. It is often said, for example, that sensations are simple and that percepts are complex. Yet, only if there is offered some agreed upon (a priori) basis for separating experiences into two categories—sensations and percepts—can experimental procedures demonstrate that the items in one category are “simpler” than those in the other.

Content: Literary critics, historians, avid readers, and even casual readers will all have different opinions on which novel is truly the “greatest book ever written.” Is it a novel with beautiful, captivating figurative language? Or one with gritty realism? A novel that has had an immense social impact? Or one that has more subtly affected the world? Here is a list of 12 novels that, for various reasons, have been considered some of the greatest works of literature ever written.  Any fan of stories that involve juicy subjects like adultery, gambling, marriage plots, and, well, Russian feudalism, would instantly place   at the peak of their “greatest novels” list. And that’s exactly the ranking that publications like   magazine have given the novel since it was published in its entirety in 1878. Written by Russian novelist  , the eight-part towering work of fiction tells the story of two major characters: a tragic, disenchanted housewife, the titular  , who runs off with her young lover, and a lovestruck landowner named  , who struggles in faith and philosophy. Tolstoy molds together thoughtful discussions on love, pain, and family in Russian society with a sizable cast of characters regarded for their realistic humanity. The novel was especially revolutionary in its treatment of women, depicting prejudices and social hardships of the time with vivid emotion. , believed to be one of the most influential authors to have ever existed, famously published only a single novel (up until its controversial sequel was published in 2015 just before her death). Lee’s   was published in 1960 and became an immediate classic of literature. The novel examines racism in the American South through the innocent wide eyes of a clever young girl named Jean Louise (“Scout”) Finch. Its iconic characters, most notably the sympathetic and just lawyer and father Atticus Finch, served as role models and changed perspectives in the United States at a time when tensions regarding race were high.   earned the   for fiction in 1961 and was made into an  , giving the story and its characters further life and influence over the American social sphere. ’s   is distinguished as one of the greatest texts for introducing students to the art of reading literature critically (which means you may have read it in school). The novel is told from the perspective of a young man named   who has recently moved to New York City and is befriended by his eccentric nouveau riche neighbor with mysterious origins,  .   provides an insider’s look into the Jazz Age of the 1920s in United States history while at the same time critiquing the idea of the “American Dream.” Perhaps the most famous aspect of the novel is its cover art—a piercing face projected onto a dark blue night sky and lights from a cityscape—an image that is also found, in a slightly different configuration, within the text itself as a key symbol. The late Colombian author   published his most famous work,  , in 1967. The novel tells the story of seven generations of the Buendía family and follows the establishment of their town Macondo until its destruction along with the last of the family’s descendents. In fantastical form, the novel explores the genre of   by emphasizing the extraordinary nature of commonplace things while mystical things are shown to be common. Márquez highlights the prevalence and power of myth and folktale in relating history and Latin American culture. The novel won many awards for Márquez, leading the way to his eventual honor of the   for Literature in 1982 for his entire body of work, of which   is often lauded as his most triumphant.  wrote his novel   after multiple trips to the country throughout his early life. The book was published in 1924 and follows a Muslim Indian doctor named   and his relationships with an English professor, Cyril Fielding, and a visiting English schoolteacher named  . When Adela believes that Aziz has assaulted her while on a trip to the Marabar caves near the fictional city of Chandrapore, where the story is set, tensions between the Indian community and the colonial British community rise. The possibility of friendship and connection between English and Indian people, despite their cultural differences and imperial tensions, is explored in the conflict. The novel’s colorful descriptions of nature, the landscape of India, and the figurative power that they are given within the text solidifies it as a great work of fiction. Often confused with H.G. Wells’s science-fiction novella of nearly the same name (just subtract a “The”),  ’s   is a groundbreaking novel in the expression of identity for the African American male. The narrator of the novel, a man who is never named but believes he is “invisible” to others socially, tells the story of his move from the South to college and then to New York City. In each location he faces extreme adversity and discrimination, falling into and out of work, relationships, and questionable social movements in a wayward and ethereal mindset. The novel is renowned for its surreal and experimental style of writing that explores the symbolism surrounding African American identity and culture.   won the U.S.   for Fiction in 1953. ’s  , perhaps the most influential and well-known work of Spanish literature, was first published in full in 1615. The novel, which is very regularly regarded as one of the best literary works of all time, tells the story of   and sets off in a fit of obsession over romantic novels about   to revive the custom and become a hero himself. The character of Don Quixote has become an idol and somewhat of an archetypal character, influencing many major works of art, music, and literature since the novel’s publication. The text has been so influential that a word,  , based on the Don Quixote character, was created to describe someone who is, “foolishly impractical especially in the pursuit of ideals; especially: marked by rash lofty romantic ideas or extravagantly chivalrous action.” ’s 1987 spiritual and haunting novel   tells the story of an escaped slave named Sethe who has fled to Cincinnati, Ohio, in the year 1873. The novel investigates the trauma of slavery even after freedom has been gained, depicting Sethe’s guilt and emotional pain after having killed her own child, whom she named Beloved, to keep her from living life as a slave. A spectral figure appears in the lives of the characters and goes by the same name as the child, embodying the family’s anguish and hardship and making their feelings and past unavoidable. The novel was lauded for addressing the psychological effects of slavery and the importance of family and community in healing.   was awarded the   for fiction in 1988. Possibly the most idiosyncratic novel of this list,  ’s   describes exactly one day in the life of a British socialite named Clarissa Dalloway. Using a combination of a third-person narration and the thoughts of various characters, the novel uses a stream-of-consciousness style all the way through. The result of this style is a deeply personal and revealing look into the characters’ minds, with the novel relying heavily on character rather than plot to tell its story. The thoughts of the characters include constant regrets and thoughts of the past, their struggles with mental illness and post-traumatic stress from World War I, and the effect of social pressures. The novel’s unique style, subject, and time setting make it one of the most respected and regarded works of all time.  The Western canon of “great literature” often focuses on writers who come from North America or Europe and often ignores accomplished writers and amazing works of literature from other parts of the world.  ’s  , published in 1958, is one such work of Nigerian literature that had to overcome the bias of some literary circles and one that has been able to gain recognition worldwide despite it. The novel follows an Igbo man named Okonkwo, describing his family, the village in Nigeria where he lives, and the effects of British colonialism on his native country. The novel is an example of African postcolonial literature, a genre that has grown in size and recognition since the mid-1900s as African people have been able to share their often unheard stories of imperialism from the perspective of the colonized. The novel is frequently assigned for reading in courses on world literature and African studies. ’s  , another novel often assigned for reading in school, was initially published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currer Bell to disguise the fact that the writer was a woman. Fortunately, a lot has changed with regard to women in literature since 1847, and Brontë now receives the credit she deserves for one of the most groundbreaking novels about women in history. At a time when the author felt compelled to hide her true identity,   provided a story of individualism for women. The novel’s eponymous character rises from being orphaned and poor into a successful and independent woman. The work combines themes from both Gothic and Victorian literature, revolutionizing the art of the novel by focusing on the growth in Jane’s sensibility with internalized action and writing. Though the   (a novel in the form of letters written by one or more characters) was most popular before the 19th century,   became a champion of the style with her 1982 novel  , which won a   and a  . Set in the post-Civil War American South, the novel follows a young African American girl named Celie into adulthood in letters she writes to   and to her sister Nettie. Celie faces   by her father and eventually her husband, chronicling her own suffering and growth as well as that of her friends and family. The novel explores themes of  ,  , gender, sexual orientation, and disability through its grouping of disadvantaged and damaged characters who, over time, grow to shape their own lives. The story was adapted into an  -nominated   in 1985 that, despite widespread critical acclaim, was notoriously snubbed of all 11 awards it was nominated for.

The limits of the   of each   appear to be determined ultimately by  . Locked within the code of the genetic material are instructions that specify the   beyond which a species cannot live given even the most favourable conditions. And many environmental factors act to diminish that upper age limit. The maximum life span is a theoretical number whose exact value cannot be determined from existing knowledge about an organism; it is often given as a rough estimate based on the longest-lived organism of its species known to date. A more meaningful measure is the average life span; this is a   concept that is derived by the analysis of   data for populations of each species. A related term is the expectation of  , a   number computed for humans from mortality tables drawn up by   companies. Life expectancy represents the average number of years that a group of persons, all born at the same time, might be expected to live, and it is based on the changing death rate over many past years. The concept of life span implies that there is an individual whose existence has a definite beginning and end. What   the individual in most cases presents no problem: among organisms that reproduce sexually the individual is a certain amount of living substance capable of maintaining itself alive and endowed with hereditary features that are in some measure unique. In some organisms, however, extensive and apparently indefinite   takes place and   may occur by division of a single parent organism, as in many protists, including bacteria, algae, and protozoans. If these divisions are incomplete, a   results; if the parts separate, genetically   organisms are formed. In order to consider life span in such organisms, the individual must be defined arbitrarily since the organisms are continually dividing. In a strict sense, the life spans in such instances are not comparable to those forms that are sexually produced. The beginning of an organism can be defined by the formation of the fertilized egg in sexual forms; or by the physical separation of the new organism in asexual forms (many invertebrate animals and many plants). In animals generally, birth is considered to be the beginning of the life span. The timing of birth, however, is so different in various animals that it is only a poor  . In many marine invertebrates the hatchling larva consists of relatively few cells, not nearly so far along toward adulthood as a newborn  . For even among mammals, variations are considerable. A kangaroo at birth is about an inch long and must develop further in the pouch, hardly comparable to a newborn deer, who within minutes is walking about. If   of different kinds of organisms are to be compared, it is essential that these variations be accounted for. The end of an organism’s existence results when irreversible changes have occurred to such an extent that the individual no longer actively retains its organization. There is thus a brief period during which it is impossible to say whether the organism is still alive, but this time is so short relative to the total length of life that it creates no great problem in determining life span. Some organisms seem to be potentially immortal. Unless an accident puts an end to life, they appear to be fully capable of surviving indefinitely. This   has been attributed to certain fishes and reptiles, which appear to be capable of unlimited growth. Without examining the various causes of death in detail (   ) a distinction can be made between death as a result of internal changes (i.e.,  ) and death as a result of some purely external factor, such as an accident. It is notable that the absence of aging processes is correlated with the absence of individuality. In other words, organisms in which the individual is difficult to define, as in colonial forms, appear not to age. Plants grow old as surely as do animals. However, a generally accepted definition of age in plants has not   been realized. If the age of an individual   is that time interval between the reproductive process that gave rise to the individual and the death of the individual, the age attained may be given readily for some kinds of plants but not for others. The  Table lists maximum ages, both estimated and verified, for some seed plants. An   that has 1,000   rings in the trunk is 1,000 years old. But age is less certain in the case of an arctic lupine that germinated from a seed that, containing the embryo, had been lying in a lemming’s burrow in the arctic permafrost for 10,000 years. The mushroom caps that appear overnight last for only a few days, but the network of fungus filaments in the soil (the  ) may be as old as 400 years. Because of important differences in structure, the life span of higher plants cannot be compared with that of higher animals. Normally, embryonic cells (that is, cells capable of changing in form or becoming specialized) cease to exist very early in the life of an animal. In plants, however, embryonic tissue—the plant  —may contribute to growth and   formation for a much longer time, in some cases throughout the life of the plant. Thus the oldest known trees,   of California and Nevada, have one meristem (the cambium) that has been adding cells to the diameter of these trees for, in many cases, more than 4,000 years and another meristem (the apical) that has been adding cells to the length of these trees for the same period. These meristematic tissues are as old as the plant itself; they were formed in the embryo. The wood, bark, leaves and cones, however, live for only a few years. The wood of the trunk and roots, although dead, remains a part of the tree indefinitely, but the bark, leaves, and cones are continually in the process of dying and   off. Among the lower plants only a few   possess structures that enable an estimate of their age to be made. The   ( ) grows through its own stem tip each year, leaving a ring of scales that marks the annual growth. Three to five years’ growth in this moss is common, but life spans of 10 years have been recorded. The lower portions of such a moss are dead, though intact.   ( ) forms extensive growths that fill acid bogs with a peaty turf consisting of the dead lower portions of mosses whose living tops continue growing. Mosses that become encrusted with lime (calcium carbonate) and form “tufa” beds several metres thick also have living tips and dead lower portions. On the basis of their observed annual growth, some tufa mosses are estimated to have been growing for as long as 2,800 years. No reliable method for determining the age of   exists, but on the basis of size attained and growth rate, some tree ferns are thought to be several decades old. Some  , or lycopsids, have a “storied” growth pattern similar to that of the haircap moss. Under favourable conditions some specimens live five to seven years. The woody seed plants, such as   and broadleaf  , are the most   to determination of age. In   regions, where each year’s growth is brought to an end by cold or dryness, every growth period is limited by an  —a new layer of wood added to the diameter of the tree. These rings may be counted on the cut ends of a tree that has been felled or, using a special instrument, a cylinder of wood can be cut out and the growth rings counted and studied. In the far north growth rings are so close together that they are difficult to count. In the moist tropics growth is more or less  , so that clearly defined rings are difficult to find. Often the age of a tree is estimated on the basis of its diameter, especially when the average annual increase in diameter is known. The source of greatest error in this method is the not infrequent fusing of the trunks of more than one tree, as, for example, occurred in a Montezuma   in Santa María del Tule, a little Mexican village near Oaxaca. This tree, described by the Spanish explorer   in the early 1500s, was earlier estimated on the basis of its great thickness to be 6,000 years old; later studies, however, proved it to be three trees grown together. Estimates of the age of some   have been as high as 3,000 years, but these figures, too, have turned out to be based on the fusion of close-growing trunks, none of which is more than 250 years old.   borings of bristlecone pines have shown specimens in the western   to be 4,600 years old. Plants, usually herbaceous, that live for only one   and produce flowers and seeds in that time are called annuals. They may be represented by such plants as corn and marigolds, which spend a period of a few weeks to a few months rapidly accumulating food materials. As a result of hormonal changes—brought about in many plants by changes in environmental factors such as day length and temperature—leaf-producing tissues change abruptly to flower-producing ones. The formation of flowers, fruits, and seeds rapidly depletes food reserves and the vegetative portion of the plant usually dies. Although the exhaustion of food reserves often accompanies death of the plant, it is not necessarily the cause of death. These plants, too, are usually herbaceous. They live for two growing seasons. During the first season, food is accumulated, usually in a thickened root (beets, carrots); flowering occurs in the second season. As in annuals, flowering exhausts the food reserves, and the plants die after the seeds mature. These plants have a life span of several to many years. Some are herbaceous (iris, delphinium), others are shrubs or trees. The   differ from the above-mentioned groups in that the storage structures are either permanent or are renewed each year. Perennials require from one to many years growth before flowering. The preflowering (juvenile) period is usually shorter in trees and shrubs with shorter life spans than in those with longer life spans. The long-lived beech tree ( ), for example, passes 30–40 years in the juvenile stage, during which time there is rapid growth but no flowering. Some plants—cotton and tomatoes, for example—are perennials in their native tropical regions but are capable of blooming and producing fruits, seeds, or other useful parts in their first year. Such plants are often grown as annuals in the   zones. Although there is great variety in the longevity of seeds, the dormant   plant contained within the seed will lose its viability (ability to grow) if   fails to occur within a certain time. Reports of the sprouting of wheat taken from Egyptian tombs are unfounded, but some seeds do retain their viability a long time.   seeds (actually fruits) have the longest known retention of viability. On the other hand, seeds of some willows lose their ability to germinate within a week after they have reached maturity. The loss of viability of seeds in storage, although hastened or retarded by environmental factors, is the result of changes that take place within the seed itself. The changes that have been investigated are: exhaustion of food supply; gradual denaturing or loss of   structure by protoplasmic proteins; breakdown of enzymes; accumulation of toxins resulting from the   of the seed. Some self-produced toxins may cause mutations that hamper seed germination. Since seeds of different species vary greatly in structure, physiology, and life history, no single set of age factors can apply to all seeds.

As a result of the war, France ceded all of its North American possessions east of the   to Britain. The costs of the war contributed to the British government’s decision to impose new taxes on its American colonies. Like the   (1764), the   was imposed to provide increased revenues to meet the costs of defending the enlarged  . It was the first British parliamentary attempt to raise revenue through direct taxation on a wide variety of colonial transactions, including legal writs, newspaper advertisements, and ships’ bills of lading. Enraged colonists nullified the Stamp Act through outright refusal to use the stamps as well as by riots, stamp burning, and intimidation of colonial stamp distributors.  A series of four acts, the   were passed by the British Parliament in an attempt to assert what it considered to be its historic right to exert authority over the colonies through suspension of a recalcitrant representative assembly and through strict provisions for the collection of revenue duties. The acts were resisted everywhere with verbal agitation and physical violence, deliberate evasion of duties, renewed nonimportation agreements among merchants, and overt acts of hostility toward British enforcement agents, especially in Boston. In response, in October 1768, Parliament dispatched two regiments of the British army to Boston.  In Boston, a small British army detachment that was threatened by mob harassment opened fire and killed five people, an incident soon known as the  . The soldiers were charged with murder and were given a civilian trial, in which   conducted a successful defense.  Protesting both a tax on tea (taxation without representation) and the perceived monopoly of the  , a party of Bostonians thinly disguised as   people boarded ships at anchor and dumped some £10,000 worth of tea into the harbor, an event popularly known as the  .  In retaliation for colonial resistance to British rule during the winter of 1773–74, the British Parliament enacted four measures that became known as the  : the Boston Port Act, Massachusetts Government Act, Administration of Justice Act, and Quartering Act. Rather than intimidating Massachusetts and isolating it from the other colonies, the oppressive acts became the justification for convening the First Continental Congress later in 1774.  Called by the   in response to the Intolerable Acts, the First   convened in  . Fifty-six delegates represented all the colonies except Georgia. Convinced that war with Great Britain was inevitable, Virginian   defended strong resolutions for equipping the Virginia militia to fight against the British in a fiery speech in a Richmond church with the famous words, “I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”  On the night of April 18, 1775,     to   (both in Massachusetts) to warn that the British were marching from Boston to seize the colonial armory at  . En route, the British force of 700 men was met on Lexington Green by 77 local   and others. It is unclear who fired the first shot, but it sparked a skirmish that left eight Americans dead. At Concord, the British were met by hundreds of militiamen. Outnumbered and running low on ammunition, the British column was forced to retire to Boston. On the return march, American snipers took a deadly toll on the British. Total losses in the   numbered 273 British and more than 90 Americans. Breed’s Hill in   was the primary locus of combat in the misleadingly named  , which was part of the American  . Some 2,300 British troops eventually cleared the hill of the entrenched Americans, but at the cost of more than 40 percent of the assault force. The battle was a moral victory for the Americans.  In late 1775 the colonial conflict with the British still looked like a  , not a war aiming to separate nations; however, the publication of  ’s irreverent     abruptly put independence on the agenda. Paine’s 50-page pamphlet, couched in elegant direct language, sold more than 100,000 copies within a few months. More than any other single publication,   paved the way for the Declaration of Independence.  After the Congress recommended that colonies form their own governments, the   was written by   and revised in committee. On July 2 the Congress voted for independence; on   it adopted the Declaration of Independence. On September 21, 1776, having penetrated the British lines on   to obtain information, American Capt.   was captured by the British. He was hanged without trial the next day. Before his death, Hale is thought to have said, “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country,” a remark similar to one in the play   by  .  Having been   and driven across New Jersey by the British, George Washington and the Continental Army struck back on Christmas night by stealthily  , surprising the Hessian garrison at   at dawn, and taking some 900 prisoners. The American triumph at Trenton and in the Battle of Princeton (January 3, 1777) roused the new country and kept the struggle for independence alive.  Moving south from Canada in summer 1777, a British force under Gen.   captured Fort Ticonderoga (July 5) before losing decisively at Bennington, Vermont (August 16), and Bemis Heights, New York (October 7). His forces depleted, Burgoyne surrendered at Saratoga.  Following failures at the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown, Washington and 11,000 regulars took up winter quarters at  , 22 miles (35 km) northwest of British-occupied Philadelphia. Although its ranks were decimated by rampant disease, semi-starvation, and bitter cold, the reorganized Continental Army emerged the following June as a well-disciplined and efficient fighting force.  The French had secretly furnished financial and material aid to the Americans since 1776, but with the signing in Paris of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce and the Treaty of Alliance, the Franco-American alliance was formalized. France began preparing fleets and armies to enter the fight but did not formally declare war on Britain until June 1778.  The U.S. battleship the   was getting the worst of its battle with the British vessel HMS   off  , England, when the American commander,  , refused to surrender, proclaiming, “I have not yet begun to fight!” Jones ultimately triumphed, but he lost his ship in the process.  Having fought valiantly in a number of battles earlier in the war, American Gen.   conspired with the British to surrender the fort at West Point, New York, that he commanded. When  , the British army officer with whom Arnold had negotiated, was hanged as a spy after he was captured and the plot revealed, Arnold took sanctuary with the British.  The  , a plan of government organization that served as a bridge between the initial government by the Continental Congress and the federal government provided under the   of 1787, were written in 1776–77 and adopted by the Congress on November 15, 1777. However, the articles were not fully ratified by the states until March 1, 1781.  After winning a costly victory at Guilford Courthouse, North Carolina, on March 15, 1781,   entered Virginia to join other British forces there, setting up a base at Yorktown. Washington’s army and a force under the French   placed  , and Cornwallis surrendered his army of more than 7,000 men on October 19, 1781. After the British defeat at Yorktown, the land battles in America largely died out—but the fighting continued at sea, chiefly between the British and America’s European allies, which  . The military verdict in North America was reflected in the preliminary Anglo-American peace treaty of 1782, which was included in the  . By its terms, Britain recognized the independence of the United States with generous boundaries, including the Mississippi River on the west. Britain retained Canada but ceded East and West Florida to Spain.

Content: These five thinkers transformed Western philosophy and shaped its development from the 17th through the 20th century and beyond.  (1596–1650) is traditionally considered the father of modern philosophy for rejecting completely the worldview of Aristotelian   and developing in its place a new science based on mechanistic principles, a new   based on an original form of mind-body (or mind-matter)  , a new   based on methodical doubt (the systematic rejection of any belief that could conceivably be false), and the theory of  . Descartes was also a great mathematician, having invented the field of  , a method of representing and solving algebraic problems geometrically and geometric problems algebraically. He is perhaps best known as the author of the famous phrase   (Latin: “I think, therefore I am”), a version of which he used in his   (1641) as a foundation of absolute certainty on which to reestablish human knowledge of the self (or mind), God, and the external (physical) world. Descartes’s metaphysical dualism, which recognized mind and matter as distinct and irreducible basic substances, gave rise to the modern mind-body problem, the challenge of explaining how mental phenomena can causally interact with physical states and events. His methodical doubt gave rise to the modern  , the challenge of justifying one’s belief that others have mental lives similar to one’s own, among many other epistemological conundrums. And his conception of the mind as a repository of innate ideas gave rise to the philosophical school of   and in the 20th century inspired scientific investigations of innate mental faculties and structures in   and theoretical  . * During the last year of his life, Descartes served as tutor to the young   of Sweden, who made him rise before 5 o’clock in the morning to give her lessons in philosophy. On his way to attend the queen on the morning of February 1, 1650, he caught a chill, and 10 days later he died of pneumonia. * Although Descartes never married, he fathered a child, Francine, by his housekeeper, Helena Jans, in 1635. The girl’s death of scarlet fever at the age of five was the greatest sorrow of Descartes’s life. * To avoid persecution by French religious authorities for his philosophical and scientific views, Descartes spent much of his adult life in the Netherlands. While there he lived alone, concealed his whereabouts, and moved frequently, living in 18 different places in 22 years. * Despite his status as a great thinker, Kant is generally regarded as one of the worst writers in the history of Western philosophy. The bad writing of his first major work, the   (1781), resulted in what he considered a serious misinterpretation by critics and caused him to issue a second edition (1787), whose inconsistency with the first edition has resulted in a centuries-long debate about his original intentions. * Kant’s quiet life and regular habits eventually became an object of curiosity and derision. He was born and died in the same small Prussian town, Königsberg, and it was plausibly said of him that one could set one’s watch by the time he took his regular afternoon walk. * Kant credited the birth of his critical philosophy to the   philosopher  , whose radical empiricism, he said, awoke him from his “dogmatic slumber.”  (1844–1900) was a German philosopher, classicist, and cultural critic whose highly original and penetrating attacks on conventional Western philosophy, religion, and morality profoundly affected the development of European philosophy in the 20th century and influenced important figures in many other intellectual and artistic fields, including theology, psychology, history, literature, and music. His aphoristic, romantic, and often poetic style of writing and the undeniable artistic merit of his German prose contributed to the eventual popularity and influence of his thought. But his characteristically unsystematic and fragmentary philosophical reflections were easily misunderstood or oversimplified. After his death, aspects of his philosophy, especially his notion of the “will to power,” were misrepresented in grossly bowdlerized texts published by his sister,  , who for her own purposes attempted to cast her brother as a prophet of German   and  , a caricature that was enthusiastically adopted by cultural officials of the   regime in the 1930s. In reality, Nietzsche abhorred both nationalism and anti-Semitism. Nietzsche is remembered for many other provocative but frequently misunderstood doctrines, including “slave morality,” the death of God, and the “ ” or  .  * In his early academic career Nietzsche was recognized as a brilliant classical philologist. He was granted a doctorate by the University of Leipzig without dissertation or examination and was appointed to a chair at the University of Basel when he was only 24 years old. * In 1870, while serving as a medical orderly during the Franco-German War, Nietzsche contracted diphtheria and dysentery. He was thereafter in continual ill health, suffering migraine headaches, vomiting, and vision problems that forced his permanent retirement from teaching in 1879. * After collapsing in the street in Turin, Italy, in 1889, Nietzsche became completely and permanently insane. He spent the last 10 years of his life in mental darkness, first in an asylum and then in the care of his mother and sister. Various causes of his breakdown have been proposed, including tertiary syphilis and retro-orbital meningioma, a tumor on the surface of his brain behind his right eye. * Three of Wittgenstein’s four brothers committed suicide.  * When Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge, he submitted the   as a dissertation in fulfillment of the doctoral degree. His oral examination was conducted by Russell and Moore, a ritual that both older philosophers regarded as absurd. Wittgenstein ended the discussion by telling his examiners, “Don’t worry, I know you’ll never understand it.” He was passed anyway. * Wittgenstein’s obsessive, neurotic, and domineering personality was well known and caused even some of his admirers, including Russell, to openly question his sanity. At a meeting of the Moral Sciences Club at Cambridge in 1946, Wittgenstein flew into a rage at a guest speaker, the eminent philosopher of science  , and allegedly threatened him with a poker that he had pulled from a fireplace. According to one version of the story, violence was averted only after Russell ordered Wittgenstein to put the poker down. * Several of Heidegger’s students became important thinkers in their own right. One of them, the political theorist  , had an affair with the married Heidegger in the 1920s. Because of her Jewish heritage, she fled Germany after the Nazi takeover in 1933. * In 2014 the first three volumes of Heidegger’s so-called “black notebooks,” containing his private philosophical and political reflections, were published in Germany. They contained several overtly anti-Semitic passages woven into philosophical discussions, apparently lending support to the view that aspects of Heidegger’s philosophy were inherently fascistic. * Heidegger’s complete works, when finally published, will run to more than 100 volumes, making him one of the most prolific writers in the history of Western philosophy.

Mind is in some sense reflected in such occurrences as sensations, perceptions, emotions, memory, desires, various types of  , motives, choices, traits of  , and the  . A brief treatment of mind follows. The subject of mind is treated in a number of articles. For a philosophical treatment of Western  ,    . For scientific treatment of the so-called mental faculties,    ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  . For treatment of Eastern conceptions, in the   of the respective philosophical traditions,    ;  ; etc. To the extent that mind is   in observable phenomena, it has frequently been regarded as a peculiarly   possession. Some theories, however, posit the existence of mind in other animals besides human beings. One theory regards mind as a universal property of matter. According to another view, there may be superhuman minds or intelligences, or a single absolute mind, a   intelligence. Several assumptions are indispensible to any discussion of the concept of mind. First is the assumption of   or thinking. If there were no evidence of thought in the world, mind would have little or no meaning. The   of this fact throughout history accounts for the development of   theories of mind. It may be supposed that such words as “thought” or “thinking” cannot, because of their own  , help to define the sphere of mind. But whatever the relation of thinking to  , thinking seems to involve more—for almost all observers—than a mere reception of impressions from without. This seems to be the opinion of those who make thinking a consequence of sensing, as well as of those who regard thought as independent of sense. For both, thinking goes beyond sensing, either as an elaboration of the materials of sense or as an   of objects that are totally beyond the reach of the senses. The second assumption that seems to be a root common to all conceptions of mind is that of   or knowing. This may be questioned on the ground that, if there were   without any form of thought, judgment, or reasoning, there would be at least a   form of knowledge—some degree of   or awareness by one thing or another. If one grants the point of this objection, it nevertheless seems true that the distinction between truth and falsity and the difference between knowledge, error, and ignorance or between knowledge, belief, and opinion do not apply to sensations in the total absence of thought. Any understanding of knowledge that involves these distinctions seems to imply mind for the same reason that it implies thought. There is a further   of mind in the fact of self-knowledge. Sensing may be awareness of an object, and to this extent it may be a kind of knowing, but it has never been observed that the senses can sense or be aware of themselves. Thought seems to be not only reflective but reflexive, that is, able to consider itself, to define the nature of thinking, and to develop theories of mind. This fact about thought—its reflexivity—also seems to be a common element in all the meanings of “mind.” It is sometimes referred to as “the reflexivity of the intellect,” as “the reflexive power of the understanding,” as “the ability of the understanding to reflect upon its own acts,” or as “self-consciousness.” Whatever the phrasing, a world without   or self-knowledge would be a world in which the traditional   of mind would probably not have arisen. The third assumption is that of purpose or  , of planning a course of action with foreknowledge of its goal or of working in any other way toward a desired and foreseen objective. As in the case of sensitivity, the phenomena of desire do not, without further qualification, indicate the realm of mind. According to the theory of natural desire, for example, the natural tendencies of even inanimate and insensitive things are expressions of desire. But it is not in that sense of desire that the assumption of purpose or intention is here taken as evidence of mind. It is rather on the level of the behaviour of living things that purpose seems to require a factor over and above the senses, limited as they are to present appearances. It cannot be found in the passions, which have the same limitation as the senses, for unless they are checked they tend toward immediate emotional discharge. That factor, called for by the direction of conduct to future ends, is either an element common to all meanings of “mind” or is at least an element associated with mind. It is sometimes called the faculty of will—rational desire or the   appetite. Sometimes it is treated as the act of willing, which, along with thinking, is one of the two major activities of mind or understanding; and sometimes purposiveness is regarded as the very essence of mentality. These assumptions—thought, knowledge or self-knowledge, and purpose—seem to be common to all theories of mind. More than that, they seem to be assumptions that require the development of the conception. The   of theories concerning what the human mind is, what structure it has, what parts belong to it, and what whole it belongs to does not   the entire range of controversy on the subject. Yet enough is common to all theories of mind to permit certain other questions to be formulated: How does the mind operate? How does it do whatever is its work, and with what   excellences or defects? What is the relation of mind to matter, to bodily organs, to material conditions, or of one mind to another (   )? Is mind a common possession of men and animals, or is whatever might be called mind in animals distinctly different from the human mind? Are there minds or a mind in existence apart from man and the whole world of corporeal life? What are the limits of so-called  , the capacity of machines to perform functions generally associated with mind? The intelligibility of the positions taken in the disputes of these issues depends to some degree on the divergent conceptions of the human mind from which they stem. The conclusions achieved in such fields as theory of knowledge (   ),  , logic,  , and the   are all relevant to the   of mind; and its conclusions, in turn, have important   for those fields. Moreover, this   applies as well to its relations to such     as neurology,  ,  , and history.

The word, brought into English from the Greek  , was for some time most commonly used roughly in the technical sense given to it by   in his  . By the 17th century it had come to be used more or less in its modern sense of “thought,” “concept,” “belief,” “intention,” or “plan.” In the 17th and 18th centuries, the word “idea” was in very general use as a technical term of  , not with its   meaning, but in a variety of senses mostly traceable to  , some of which were derived by him from  . In his  , Locke introduces it first as “that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a   thinks” and later as signifying “the immediate object of  ,  , or understanding.” This vague usage leads him into serious difficulties. In the first place, he holds that ideas are “in the mind”; so that, if ideas are said to be the objects of perception, he is faced with the problem of explaining how perception could lead to knowledge of the “external” world. Secondly, he is led to overlook the important respects in which thinking and understanding must be distinguished from perception: he speaks indeed as if thinking and understanding really are essentially forms of perception, or as if all three consisted alike in “having ideas.”  retained the word “idea,” for which he sometimes used “sensation” as a  , to stand for the objects of perception. He retained the view that ideas are “in the mind,” and he sought to evade the problem which Locke had failed to solve—the problem of basing knowledge of the material world on perception of mind-dependent ideas—by refusing to draw any distinction between ideas and material objects. Material objects, he held, are “collections” of ideas, and hence they too can exist “only in the mind.”  introduced a distinction between ideas and impressions—the latter term being designed to cover “all our sensations, passions, and emotions,” the former “the faint images of these in thinking and reasoning.” In so doing, however, he did not much improve upon Locke: he still held that the objects of perception are “in the mind” and for the most part he retained in his account of thinking the fatally misleading   with perception. It was urged by an early critic,  , that most of the perplexities in which Locke, Berkeley, and Hume had been entangled arose from initial confusions in the use of the word “idea,” for which Reid thought Descartes ultimately responsible. Even though it can hardly be adequate to trace all difficulties to this one source, it can be said that their uses of the term “idea” require very close and critical scrutiny, if their problems are to be resolved or even rightly understood.

For example, a dog conditioned to salivate to a tone of a particular pitch and loudness will also salivate with considerable regularity in response to tones of higher and lower pitch. The generalized response is predictable and orderly: it will measure less than that elicited by the original tone and will diminish as the new tone departs increasingly from the original. Similar behaviour is observed in humans, as children learning to talk may call anything that can be sat upon “chair” or any man “daddy.” Adults conditioned by mild electric shock to fear a certain word will respond with symptoms of anxiety to any synonym of that word; in this instance, physical similarity, the usual basis of generalization, is less important than prior learning. Responses may also be generalized, allowing an individual to take an alternative course of action if the usual response is for some reason precluded. Learning may be considered a balance of generalization and discrimination (the ability to respond to differences among stimuli). An imbalance can lead to negative results. For example, a child who is scared by a man with a beard may fail to discriminate between bearded men and generalize that all men with beards are to be feared.

Content: Traditionally favored by private and parochial institutions,   are being adopted by US public schools in increasing numbers. According to a 2020 report, the percentage of public schools that required school uniforms jumped from 12% in the 1999-2000 school year to 20% in the 2017-18 school year. School uniforms were most frequently required by elementary schools (23%), followed by middle (18%), and high schools (10%). The first recorded use of   in education may have been in England in 1222, when the Archbishop of Canterbury mandated that students wear a robe-like outfit called the “cappa clausa.” The origin of the modern school uniform can be traced to 16th Century England, when the impoverished “charity children” attending the Christ’s Hospital boarding school wore blue cloaks reminiscent of the cassocks worn by clergy, along with yellow stockings. As of Sep. 2014, students at Christ’s Hospital were still wearing the same uniform, and according to the school it is the oldest school uniform still in use. When Christ’s Hospital surveyed its students in 2011, 95% voted to keep the traditional uniforms. School uniforms in the United States followed the traditional use of uniforms established in England and were generally limited to private and parochial schools. One exception was found in government-run boarding schools for   children, first established in the late 1800s, where the children, who had been removed from their families, were dressed in military-style uniforms. According to figures released in 2018 by the National Center for Education Statistics, the total number of public schools nationwide requiring students to wear school uniforms increased from 12% during the 1999-2000 school year to 21% during the 2015-2016 school year. In 2015-2016, 25% of public primary schools enforced a uniform policy, as did 20% of public middle schools and 12% of public high schools. A higher proportion of schools located in cities had mandatory uniforms in 2015-2016 than schools in suburban, town, and rural areas. Mandatory   were far more prevalent in “high-poverty” schools (in which 76% of students were eligible for reduced-cost or free lunch programs) than in “low-poverty” schools. Among the US cities with the highest use of   in public schools are Philadelphia (100% of schools), New Orleans (95%), Cleveland (85%), Chicago (80%), Boston (65%), and Miami (60%). The number of schools with “strict dress codes” has also increased, from 47% in 2000 to 57% in 2010.

Content:  was a 16th-century seer. He and his prophecies—revered by some, ridiculed by others—are still well known today, centuries after he lived, and continue to be the subject of debate. Nostradamus was born in   in 1503. He first worked as a physician and began his medical practice in the 1530s, although he did so without a medical degree. He began making prophecies about 1547, and he published his prophecies in a book entitled   (1555). He wrote his prophecies in quatrains: four lines of rhyming verse. The quatrains were grouped in hundreds; each set of 100 quatrains was called a century. Nostradamus gained notoriety during his lifetime when some of his predictions appeared to have come true. He was highly sought after and was even invited to the court of  , then the queen consort of   of France, to create   for her children. Nostradamus’s predictions tended to be about general types of events, like natural disasters and conflict-related events that tend to occur regularly as time goes on. Some people believe that his prophecies have predicted actual events, such as the death of Henry II, the  , the rise of  , the rise of  , and the  . Others maintain that because his prophecies tend to be about general types of events that occur frequently throughout history—and are written in a cryptic and vague manner—it’s possible to find one that seems to match almost any event that has occurred.

Content: As you watch someone carelessly munching on an apple core, some vague alarm bells go off in your head. Didn't you hear somewhere that apple seeds are poisonous?     seeds (and the seeds of related plants, such as   and  ) contain amygdalin, a cyanogenic   composed of   and sugar. When metabolized in the  , this chemical degrades into highly poisonous   (HCN). A lethal dose of HCN can kill within minutes. Thankfully, there are several factors that make death-by-apple-seed very unlikely. First, the amygdalin is accessible only if the seeds have been crushed or chewed; a whole unbroken seed will pass right through. Second, the human body can process HCN in small doses, so a couple of chewed seeds are usually completely harmless. Finally, the average adult would need to eat anywhere from 150 to several thousand crushed seeds (depending on the apple variety) to be at risk of  . The average apple contains only about five to eight seeds. So unless someone is eating their 18th consecutive apple core and has been meticulously chewing all the seeds, they should be fine with their occasional absentminded core chomping.

Some items in his list are obvious—the names of world leaders, Watergate, the invention of television—while some are obscure: What in the world is a “rock and roller Cola War”? We did the research so you don’t have to. Here are the stories behind all 119 historical references Billy Joel deemed worthy of attention in 1989. Looking for the references in Fall Out Boy’s 2023 update of this song?   was the 33rd president of the United States, leading the country through the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War.

After World War II the Soviet Union occupied all land on the Korean peninsula north of the 38th parallel, and the United States occupied all land to the south on the peninsula. Though the Allied powers originally planned to exit and leave Korea a united nation once more, Soviet and American interference created two very different governments: a communist state in the north and a democratic state in the south. When the U.N. recognized the southern   as an independent state (1947),   waged a   (1950) to reunify the peninsula—an effort that ultimately failed.

From 1961 to 1989 the   separated West Berlin, a democratic state allied with the West, from East Berlin, a communist state aligned with the Soviet Union. The CIA had planned an invasion of Cuba since 1960, shortly after   came to power and transformed Cuba into a communist state. They executed the plan in 1961, when three U.S. airplanes piloted by Cubans bombed Cuban air bases and, two days later, landed at several sites. But the small force of the  —named for the principal landing location on Cuba’s south-central coast—contained nothing close to the strength of Castro’s troops. The CIA-directed agents were captured, and the invasion failed. Released in 1962, the historical epic   became an almost-instant classic and made its relatively unknown lead actor   into a major star. The intense fandom that grew around the British rock group   was called Beatlemania: the first collective frenzy around a band enabled by mass media. When a court battle determined that U.S. Air Force veteran   had been repeatedly denied entrance to the   only because he was Black, the school was forced to admit him; in anticipation of racist mob violence, U.S. Attorney General   called in federal protection in 1962 so that Meredith could safely register for classes. In 1962   became the first American astronaut to orbit Earth, completing three orbits. (The Soviet cosmonaut   had completed a single orbit in 1961, making   the first person in space.) American boxer   became the world heavyweight champion on September 25, 1962, when he knocked out   in the first round of their match. Giovanni Battista Montini was elected pope on June 21, 1963, choosing the name  . He oversaw much of the  , which ran from 1962 through 1965, and his tenure affirmed the  ’s opposition to birth control and its firm stance on priestly celibacy. The revolutionary civil rights leader   was assassinated in 1965 while delivering a lecture in Harlem, New York. In 1961 British Secretary of State for War   began an affair with 19-year-old  , a dancer with Russian connections. Though Profumo lied to Parliament in 1963, saying that there was “no impropriety whatsoever” in the couple’s relationship, evidence to the contrary was too strong to ignore. Ten weeks later  . Keeler, in response to the scandal, posed for a series of provocative publicity shots—one of which, picturing her nude astride a chair, became one of the most iconic photographs of the 1960s. The incident spelled the downfall of Profumo’s  : within a year, the Labour Party defeated the Conservatives in a national election. U.S. President   was   on November 22, 1963, while riding in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas.  (1965) saw the U.S. Supreme Court rule in favor of married persons’ constitutional right to use  , striking down laws that made it a crime to use or recommend contraception in many U.S. states. , who was president of North Vietnam from 1945 to 1969, waged the longest—and most costly—battle against the colonial system of all 20th-century revolutionaries. His death in 1969 damaged chances for an early settlement of tensions between Vietnam and the United States. Years after serving as Eisenhower’s vice president,   was elected the 37th president of the United States in 1968. On July 20, 1969, the first human beings arrived on the Moon. American astronaut   took the first step off the   spacecraft and onto the Moon’s surface, saying: “That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” The   in 1969, though the most famous of the 1960s rock festivals, was something of a disaster. Few people bought tickets, but some 400,000 people showed up, mostly demanding free entry—which they received, since the festival’s security was pretty much nonexistent. The event left its organizers practically bankrupt, though they were luckily able to salvage their finances by holding on to the film and recording rights of the “Three Days of Peace and Music.” ’s second presidential term was ended by  , a series of interconnected scandals uncovered following the arrest of five burglars at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Washington, D.C., Watergate hotel complex. Investigations into the burglary led to the discovery of multiple layers of presidential misconduct: Nixon had reportedly covered up White House involvement in the break-in, participated in money laundering schemes to help elect Republicans to Congress, and illegally sabotaged political opponents. Facing impeachment, Nixon resigned in 1974; the names of future American scandals were fated to include the suffix  . Spearheaded by artists such as Lenny Kaye, the Seeds, and  ,   was blossoming into an international movement by the mid-1970s.  served as prime minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983. In 1978 he and Egyptian President   were awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace for securing peace between their countries.  was the 40th president of the United States, serving from 1981 to 1989. His tenure was charactered by his conservative Republicanism, fervent anticommunism, and attempts at folksy charm. Arab-Israeli tensions over land occupation mounted in the 1970s. In March 1977 U.S. President   spoke of the need for a   homeland and described Palestinian participation in the Arab-Israeli peace process as crucial.  ’s cabinet continued to reject the suggestion of the  ’s participation. Between 1968 and 1970 nearly 200 airplane   took place in Europe and the Middle East. The trend was continued throughout the ’70s by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a militant Marxist group that organized hijackings of a number of aircraft. The most notable, the hijacking of a French jet airliner en route from Israel to France, resulted in the  . When PFLP members held the plane’s 103 Israeli or Jewish passengers hostage for the release of 53 imprisoned militants, Israel responded by dispatching a commando squad; within an hour of the squad’s arrival in Entebbe, Uganda, the hostages had been freed and the seven PFLP militants had been killed. In 1979 the Shiʿi cleric Ayatollah   led a revolution that overthrew  , the Western-aligned leader of Iran. Khomeini served as Iran’s ultimate political and religious authority for the next 10 years. In 1979  , intervening in support of the Afghan communist government in its   with anti-communist Muslim guerrillas. The Soviets remained there for nearly a decade. The American television game show   premiered in 1975. On June 18, 1983, astronaut   became the first American woman in space. She was preceded by two Soviet women: cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova in 1963 and Svetlana Savitskaya in 1982. The   subgenre known as death metal, populated by artists such as   and Judas Priest, garnered criticism for lyrics encouraging self-harm when three young fans attempted or committed suicide from 1984 to 1985. The 1980s was marked by a period of   often attributed to the United States’ growing foreign debts. A growing population of   veterans experiencing homelessness in the 1980s exposed the lack of quality health care, mental health care, and other resources available to veterans in the United States. On June 5, 1981, the U.S.   published a report describing a rare lung infection affecting five gay men in Los Angeles, California. The next year the disease, discovered to affect not only gay men but also intravenous drug users and women with male sexual partners, became known as  , or  . Though the AIDS epidemic first spread during the   administration, homophobic and inaccurate characterization of AIDS as a “gay plague” meant that Reagan himself kept quiet about it for years. He refused to say the word “AIDS” in public until 1985, when the epidemic had already killed thousands. Another devastation to the 1980s United States was the  : a significant increase in the use of crack cocaine, an affordable, highly addictive, and smokable form of cocaine. As President   intensified the U.S. government’s “ ,” defendants in federal crack cocaine cases (about 80 percent of whom were Black Americans, as of 2003) were penalized more harshly than defendants in cases involving other drugs, including  . “Mandatory minimum” prison sentences for drug offenses meant that possession of five grams of crack triggered an automatic five year sentence—while it took possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine to result in the same sentence.  was a self-proclaimed vigilante who was, in reality, a mass shooter: he shot four Black men who he claimed were planning to rob him on a New York City subway on December 22, 1984. By saying he acted in self-defense—even though there was no evidence that the men planned to rob him—Goetz was eventually found not guilty of attempted murder. He was convicted only of illegal weapons possession and served less than a year in prison. In July 1988 more than 70 syringes and vials of blood washed up on New York’s Staten Island beach. The cause was   at the area’s largest landfill: instead of following the proper procedures, workers were sending medical waste and other garbage out to sea. Following weeks of student-led protests in   and elsewhere in China demanding democratic reforms,   was declared in Beijing. When Chinese troops attempted to reach the square, they were initially thwarted by thousands of Beijing citizens blocking their way to protect the protesters. The military eventually broke through, however, and hundreds were killed and thousands wounded on the night of June 3–4, 1989. The conflict also produced one of the   of resistance to authoritarianism: an unidentified person now called   stopping a column of Chinese tanks. As soft drink companies   and   each fought to win market share in the United States, both hired rock stars as corporate representatives: Coke went with   and Pepsi with  .

Content: These five thinkers transformed Western philosophy and shaped its development from the 17th through the 20th century and beyond.  (1596–1650) is traditionally considered the father of modern philosophy for rejecting completely the worldview of Aristotelian   and developing in its place a new science based on mechanistic principles, a new   based on an original form of mind-body (or mind-matter)  , a new   based on methodical doubt (the systematic rejection of any belief that could conceivably be false), and the theory of  . Descartes was also a great mathematician, having invented the field of  , a method of representing and solving algebraic problems geometrically and geometric problems algebraically. He is perhaps best known as the author of the famous phrase   (Latin: “I think, therefore I am”), a version of which he used in his   (1641) as a foundation of absolute certainty on which to reestablish human knowledge of the self (or mind), God, and the external (physical) world. Descartes’s metaphysical dualism, which recognized mind and matter as distinct and irreducible basic substances, gave rise to the modern mind-body problem, the challenge of explaining how mental phenomena can causally interact with physical states and events. His methodical doubt gave rise to the modern  , the challenge of justifying one’s belief that others have mental lives similar to one’s own, among many other epistemological conundrums. And his conception of the mind as a repository of innate ideas gave rise to the philosophical school of   and in the 20th century inspired scientific investigations of innate mental faculties and structures in   and theoretical  . * During the last year of his life, Descartes served as tutor to the young   of Sweden, who made him rise before 5 o’clock in the morning to give her lessons in philosophy. On his way to attend the queen on the morning of February 1, 1650, he caught a chill, and 10 days later he died of pneumonia. * Although Descartes never married, he fathered a child, Francine, by his housekeeper, Helena Jans, in 1635. The girl’s death of scarlet fever at the age of five was the greatest sorrow of Descartes’s life. * To avoid persecution by French religious authorities for his philosophical and scientific views, Descartes spent much of his adult life in the Netherlands. While there he lived alone, concealed his whereabouts, and moved frequently, living in 18 different places in 22 years. * Despite his status as a great thinker, Kant is generally regarded as one of the worst writers in the history of Western philosophy. The bad writing of his first major work, the   (1781), resulted in what he considered a serious misinterpretation by critics and caused him to issue a second edition (1787), whose inconsistency with the first edition has resulted in a centuries-long debate about his original intentions. * Kant’s quiet life and regular habits eventually became an object of curiosity and derision. He was born and died in the same small Prussian town, Königsberg, and it was plausibly said of him that one could set one’s watch by the time he took his regular afternoon walk. * Kant credited the birth of his critical philosophy to the   philosopher  , whose radical empiricism, he said, awoke him from his “dogmatic slumber.”  (1844–1900) was a German philosopher, classicist, and cultural critic whose highly original and penetrating attacks on conventional Western philosophy, religion, and morality profoundly affected the development of European philosophy in the 20th century and influenced important figures in many other intellectual and artistic fields, including theology, psychology, history, literature, and music. His aphoristic, romantic, and often poetic style of writing and the undeniable artistic merit of his German prose contributed to the eventual popularity and influence of his thought. But his characteristically unsystematic and fragmentary philosophical reflections were easily misunderstood or oversimplified. After his death, aspects of his philosophy, especially his notion of the “will to power,” were misrepresented in grossly bowdlerized texts published by his sister,  , who for her own purposes attempted to cast her brother as a prophet of German   and  , a caricature that was enthusiastically adopted by cultural officials of the   regime in the 1930s. In reality, Nietzsche abhorred both nationalism and anti-Semitism. Nietzsche is remembered for many other provocative but frequently misunderstood doctrines, including “slave morality,” the death of God, and the “ ” or  .  * In his early academic career Nietzsche was recognized as a brilliant classical philologist. He was granted a doctorate by the University of Leipzig without dissertation or examination and was appointed to a chair at the University of Basel when he was only 24 years old. * In 1870, while serving as a medical orderly during the Franco-German War, Nietzsche contracted diphtheria and dysentery. He was thereafter in continual ill health, suffering migraine headaches, vomiting, and vision problems that forced his permanent retirement from teaching in 1879. * After collapsing in the street in Turin, Italy, in 1889, Nietzsche became completely and permanently insane. He spent the last 10 years of his life in mental darkness, first in an asylum and then in the care of his mother and sister. Various causes of his breakdown have been proposed, including tertiary syphilis and retro-orbital meningioma, a tumor on the surface of his brain behind his right eye. * Three of Wittgenstein’s four brothers committed suicide.  * When Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge, he submitted the   as a dissertation in fulfillment of the doctoral degree. His oral examination was conducted by Russell and Moore, a ritual that both older philosophers regarded as absurd. Wittgenstein ended the discussion by telling his examiners, “Don’t worry, I know you’ll never understand it.” He was passed anyway. * Wittgenstein’s obsessive, neurotic, and domineering personality was well known and caused even some of his admirers, including Russell, to openly question his sanity. At a meeting of the Moral Sciences Club at Cambridge in 1946, Wittgenstein flew into a rage at a guest speaker, the eminent philosopher of science  , and allegedly threatened him with a poker that he had pulled from a fireplace. According to one version of the story, violence was averted only after Russell ordered Wittgenstein to put the poker down. * Several of Heidegger’s students became important thinkers in their own right. One of them, the political theorist  , had an affair with the married Heidegger in the 1920s. Because of her Jewish heritage, she fled Germany after the Nazi takeover in 1933. * In 2014 the first three volumes of Heidegger’s so-called “black notebooks,” containing his private philosophical and political reflections, were published in Germany. They contained several overtly anti-Semitic passages woven into philosophical discussions, apparently lending support to the view that aspects of Heidegger’s philosophy were inherently fascistic. * Heidegger’s complete works, when finally published, will run to more than 100 volumes, making him one of the most prolific writers in the history of Western philosophy.

There are two major determinants of   sexual activity: the inherited sexual response patterns that have evolved as a means of ensuring reproduction and that are a part of each individual’s genetic inheritance, and the degree of restraint or other types of influence exerted on individuals by society in the expression of their  . The objective here is to describe and explain both sets of factors and their interaction. It should be noted that taboos in Western   and the immaturity of the social sciences for a long time impeded research concerning human sexual activity, so that by the early 20th century scientific knowledge was largely restricted to individual case histories that had been studied by such European writers as  ,  , and  . By the 1920s, however, the foundations had been laid for the more extensive statistical studies that were conducted before   in the United States. Of the two major organizations for   study, one, the   in Berlin (established in 1897), was destroyed by the Nazis in 1933. The other, the Institute for Sex Research (later renamed  ), begun in 1938 by the American sexologist   at   in Bloomington, undertook the study of human sexual activity. Much of the following discussion rests on the findings of the Institute for Sex Research, which   the most   data available. The only other country for which comprehensive data exist is Sweden. Human sexual activity may conveniently be classified according to the number and   of the participants. There is solitary activity involving only one individual, and there is sociosexual activity involving more than one person. Sociosexual activity is generally divided into heterosexual activity (male with female) and homosexual activity (male with male or female with female). If three or more individuals are involved it is, of course, possible to have heterosexual and homosexual activity simultaneously. In both solitary and sociosexual activity there may be activities that are sufficiently unusual to warrant the label   activity. The term deviant should not be used as a   judgment but simply as indicating that such activity is not common in a particular society. Since human societies differ in their sexual practices, what is deviant in one society may be normal in another. Self-masturbation is self-stimulation with the intention of causing sexual arousal and, generally, orgasm (sexual climax). Most   is done in private as an end in itself but is sometimes practiced to   a sociosexual relationship. Masturbation, generally beginning at or before  , is very common among males, particularly young males, but becomes less frequent or is abandoned when sociosexual activity is available. Consequently, masturbation is most frequent among the unmarried. Fewer females masturbate; in the  , roughly one-half to two-thirds have done so, as compared to nine out of ten males. Females also tend to reduce or discontinue masturbation when they develop sociosexual relationships. There is great individual variation in frequency, so that it is impractical to try to define what range could be considered “normal.” The   persists, despite scientific proof to the contrary, that masturbation is physically harmful. Neither is there evidence that masturbation is immature activity; it is common among adults deprived of sociosexual opportunities. While solitary masturbation does provide pleasure and relief from the tension of sexual excitement, it does not have the same psychological gratification that interaction with another person provides; thus, extremely few people prefer masturbation to sociosexual activity. The psychological significance of masturbation lies in how the individual regards it. For some, it is laden with guilt; for others, it is a release from tension with no emotional content; and for others it is simply another source of pleasure to be enjoyed for its own sake. The majority of males and females have fantasies of some sociosexual activity while they masturbate. The   not infrequently involves idealized sexual partners and activities that the individual has not experienced and even might   in real life. Since the masturbating person is in sole control of the areas that are stimulated, the degree of pressure, and the rapidity of movement, masturbation is often more effective in producing sexual arousal and   than is sociosexual activity, during which the stimulation is determined to some degree by one’s partner. Orgasm in   evidently occurs only in humans. Its causes are not wholly known. The   that it results from the pressure of accumulated   is invalid because not only do nocturnal emissions sometimes occur in males on successive nights, but females experience orgasm in sleep as well. In some cases orgasm in sleep seems a compensatory phenomenon, occurring during times when the individual has been deprived of or   from other sexual activity. In other cases it may result from external stimuli, such as sleeping prone or having night clothing caught between one’s legs. Most orgasms during sleep are accompanied by erotic dreams. A great majority of males experience orgasm in sleep. This almost always begins and is most frequent in adolescence, tending to disappear later in life. Fewer females have orgasm in sleep, and, unlike males, they usually begin having such experience when fully adult. Orgasm in sleep is generally infrequent, seldom exceeding a dozen times per year for males and three or four times a year for the average female. Most sexual arousal does not lead to sexual activity with another individual. Humans are constantly exposed to sexual   when seeing attractive persons and are subjected to sexual themes in advertising and the  . Response to such visual and other stimuli is strongest in adolescence and early adult life and usually gradually declines with advancing age. One of the necessary tasks of growing up is learning to cope with one’s sexual arousal and to achieve some balance between suppression, which can be injurious, and free expression, which can lead to social difficulties. There is great variation among individuals in the strength of   and responsiveness, so this necessary exercise of restraint is correspondingly difficult or easy.

Samuelson was educated at the   (B.A., 1935) and at   (Ph.D., 1941). He became a professor of   at the   (MIT) in 1940. He also served as an economic adviser to the   government. Samuelson contributed to many areas of economic theory through powerful mathematical techniques that he employed essentially as puzzle-solving devices. His   (1947) provides the basic theme of his work, with the universal nature of consumer behaviour seen as the key to economic theory. Samuelson studied such   fields as the   and stability of  , the incorporation of the theory of   into that of general economic  , the analysis of public goods,   theory,  , and public expenditure. Of particular influence has been his mathematical formulation of the interaction of   and accelerator effects and, in   analysis, his development of the theory of revealed preference. Samuelson’s lucid prose contributed to the popularity of his publications. His introductory textbook,   (1948), is considered a classic.   was published in five volumes between 1966 and 1986.

(born May 15, 1915,  ,  , U.S.—died December 13, 2009, Belmont, Massachusetts) was an American economist who was awarded the   in Economic Sciences in 1970 for his fundamental contributions to nearly all branches of   theory. Samuelson was educated at the   (B.A., 1935) and at   (Ph.D., 1941). He became a professor of   at the   (MIT) in 1940. He also served as an economic adviser to the   government. Samuelson contributed to many areas of economic theory through powerful mathematical techniques that he employed essentially as puzzle-solving devices. His   (1947) provides the basic theme of his work, with the universal nature of consumer behaviour seen as the key to economic theory. Samuelson studied such   fields as the   and stability of  , the incorporation of the theory of   into that of general economic  , the analysis of public goods,   theory,  , and public expenditure. Of particular influence has been his mathematical formulation of the interaction of   and accelerator effects and, in   analysis, his development of the theory of revealed preference. Samuelson’s lucid prose contributed to the popularity of his publications. His introductory textbook,   (1948), is considered a classic.   was published in five volumes between 1966 and 1986. Samuelson was a columnist for   from 1966 to 1981. He was the coauthor of the textbooks   and  , both first published in 1989.

(born August 15, 1933,  , New York, U.S.—died December 20, 1984, New York City) American social psychologist known for his controversial and groundbreaking experiments on   to authority. Milgram’s obedience experiments, in addition to other studies that he carried out during his career, generally are considered to have provided important insight into human social behaviour, particularly   and social pressure.    . Milgram was born and raised in the Bronx, the second of three children in a working-class Jewish family. As a youth, he was an exceptional student, with interests in   and the arts. At Queens College (later part of the   [CUNY]), he studied  , in addition to taking courses in art, literature, and music. In 1953, following his third year at the college, he toured Europe and became increasingly interested in  . He was accepted into the graduate program in international affairs at  . However, in 1954, after completing a   in political science at Queens College, Milgram instead began graduate studies in the social relations department at  . At Harvard, Milgram took classes with leading social psychologists of the day, including  ,  , Roger Brown, and  , all of whom greatly influenced the direction of Milgram’s academic career. Of particular interest to Milgram were Asch’s conformity experiments, which showed that individual behaviour can be influenced by  , with individuals conforming to group perspectives, even when choices made by the group are obviously incorrect. Milgram set out to apply Asch’s group technique, with several variations, to the study of conformity on a national level, seeking to explore national  . He focused initially on the   and Norway and later added France, using his connections at Harvard to travel to Oslo and Paris to establish study groups there. He used an auditory task to measure conformity, with participants in closed booths asked to distinguish between the lengths of two tones. Participants also heard the responses of other members of the study group, who supposedly occupied closed booths next to the participant (the group responses were recorded, and the other booths were empty). Milgram’s findings suggested that Americans and Norwegians differed little in conformity rates and that, of the three groups, the French were the least conforming. In 1960, after earning a Ph.D. from Harvard, Milgram accepted a position as assistant professor at  . There he narrowed his research to obedience. Having been acutely aware from his   of his Jewish heritage and the tragedies suffered by Jews in Europe during the  , he was interested in understanding the factors that led people to inflict harm on others. He designed an unprecedented experiment—later known as the  —whereby study subjects, who believed that they were participating in a learning experiment about punishment and  , were instructed by an authority figure (the experimenter) to inflict seemingly painful shocks to a helpless victim (the learner). Both the experimenter and the learner were actors hired by Milgram, and the shocks were simulated via an authentic-appearing shock generator that was equipped with 30 voltage levels, increasing from 15 to 450 volts. Subjects were instructed by the experimenter to deliver a shock to the learner whenever the latter gave an incorrect answer to a question. With each incorrect response, shock intensity increased. At predetermined voltage levels, the learner (usually in a separate room) either banged on the adjoining wall, cried out in pain and pleaded with the participant to stop, or complained about a fictitious heart condition. Prior to carrying out the experiments, Milgram and Yale   students whom he polled about possible outcomes of such a study predicted that only a very small percentage (from 0 to 3 percent) of people would inflict the most-extreme-intensity shock. Hence, Milgram was surprised with the results of early pilot studies, in which most participants continued through to the extreme 450-volt limit. The first official experiments carried out by Milgram in 1961 yielded similar results—26 out of 40 men recruited for the study proved to be fully obedient to the experimenter, delivering shocks through 450 volts. Variations in the experimental design showed that obedience was highest when the learner was in a separate room, as opposed to being in close proximity to the subject (e.g., in the same room or near enough to touch). Subjects persisted in their obedience despite verbally expressing their disapproval of continuing with the shocks. Milgram suspected that subjects struggled to disengage from the experiment because of its   (“slippery slope”) progression—small demands, seemingly  , became increasingly adverse. Subjects also may have been readily conforming, seeing themselves as inferior to the experimenter in their knowledge of learning, or they may have viewed themselves as being free of responsibility, simply carrying out the experimenter’s commands. Although thought-provoking, the experiments and their findings were highly controversial. The situation placed extreme stress on the subjects, some of whom experienced nervous laughter that culminated in seizures. In  , Milgram did not reveal the full truth about the experiments to his subjects, leaving some to think that they really had shocked another person; it was not until many months later that subjects learned the true nature of the experiments. The validity of the findings also was later drawn into question by reports claiming that some participants suspected that they were the subjects being studied, with the aim of the study being to see how far they would obey the experimenter.

Content: Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.  (born November 12, 1911,  ,  , U.S.—died May 30, 2010,  , New Mexico) American   and   known for his research on the sociology of    ,  , and   formation. Clinard was one of the first to follow the   research of American criminologist  . In the early 1950s Clinard examined whether black-market offenses carried out during   should be considered white-collar crime. He challenged Sutherland’s differential association theory by arguing that the personality characteristics of black-market offenders were equally likely to explain their behaviours. Clinard later made significant and long-standing contributions to the study of white-collar and corporate crime through his research with American philosopher and criminologist  . Clinard’s early education was at  , and his doctoral training occurred at the famous “Chicago School,” officially the Department of   at the  , where he received a Ph.D. in sociology in 1941. He was a highly distinguished scholar in the   of sociology and the subfield of  . Clinard held academic positions at several universities, including the  , the  , and  . In 1957 he published  , which became a leading textbook in the fields of sociology and criminology. In the latter part of the 20th century, while at the University of Wisconsin– , Clinard worked with   to resolve ongoing definitional disputes, and their efforts resulted in the widely accepted division of white-collar crime into two distinct forms: corporate crime, which occurs on behalf of a corporation and benefits the corporation, and occupational  , which is committed by individuals against their employing organizations, and benefits the individual offender. This typology   the appropriate unit of analysis for white-collar crime research: either the corporation or the individual. As a result, additional white-collar crime research focused on either corporate crime or occupational crime. This did not solve the definitional debates, but at least it added   clarity to the field. A subsequent research contribution made by Clinard resulted from his collaboration with American sociologist  Peter Cleary Yeager on a study that was published in two forms:   (1979) and   (1980). In the Sutherland tradition, Clinard and Yeager examined crimes committed by the 477 largest manufacturing corporations and the 105 largest wholesale, retail, and service corporations in the   in the years 1975 and 1976. In that two-year time frame, these 582 corporations were the target of 1,553 federal cases. The   of the study were staggering: due to the fact that the numbers were based only on cases brought against the corporations, they underestimated the true, total amount of corporate crime. To use the authors’ terms, the findings were merely “the tip of the iceberg.” The results confirmed Sutherland’s principal finding: corporations violate the law with great frequency. The results of these studies continue to provide a valuable   for researchers examining corporate crime. In the course of his long and prominent career, Clinard wrote or cowrote more than 10 books, 40 articles, and 25 book chapters. His awards were numerous, and he was honoured by many leading academic and professional organizations in sociology, criminology, and white-collar crime, including the Academy of Criminal   Sciences, the American Society of Criminology, the American Sociological Association, and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.

The very nature of what it means to be   is being both enriched and challenged, as our species breaks the shackles of its genetic legacy and achieves inconceivable heights of intelligence, material progress, and longevity. The rate of this “paradigm shift” is now doubling every decade, so the 21st century will actually see 20,000 years of progress at today’s pace. Computation, communication, biological technologies (for example, DNA sequencing), brain scanning, knowledge of the human brain, and human knowledge in general are all accelerating at an even faster pace, generally doubling in performance, capacity, and bandwidth every year. Three-dimensional molecular computing will provide the hardware for human-level “strong”   well before 2030. The more important software insights will be gained in part from the reverse-engineering of the human brain, a process well under way. While the social and philosophical ramifications of these changes will be profound, and the threats they pose considerable, we will ultimately merge with our machines, live indefinitely, and be a billion times more intelligent…all within the next three to four decades. We will connect our biological   to a synthetic neocortex in the  . This will be done by using medical nano-robots that go into the brain through the capillaries and provide wireless communication between our neocortical modules and the cloud in the same way that your smartphone today has wireless communication with the cloud. And the same way that your smartphone today amplifies its capabilities by connecting to many computers in the cloud, we will do the same thing with our neocortex. This is a 2030s and 2040s scenario. Our thinking then will become a hybrid of the biological and nonbiological thinking in the cloud. As a result, we will become smarter, more musical, funnier, etc. But our thinking will become increasingly   as we extend further into the cloud and as the cloud becomes more powerful. Digital processes are inherently backed up, and we in turn will be able to back up our “  file” or at least most of it. Being backed up is not an absolute guarantee of “living forever,” which will be clear to anyone who has ever lost a file, but it does provide another layer of protection. I don’t like to speak about immortality but rather indefinite   to the existence of our mind file. The mind file is not just an abstraction—there is literally information in our brains that defines our memories, our skills, and our personality. And it is not backed up today. Its survival is dependent on the survival of one piece of hardware. So being able to back up our mind file or most of it will provide significant added protection. But it is not an absolute protection. I won’t be able to come to you at some point in the future and say, “ , I’ve lived forever,” because it is never forever.

(born November 12, 1911,  ,  , U.S.—died May 30, 2010,  , New Mexico) American   and   known for his research on the sociology of    ,  , and   formation. Clinard was one of the first to follow the   research of American criminologist  . In the early 1950s Clinard examined whether black-market offenses carried out during   should be considered white-collar crime. He challenged Sutherland’s differential association theory by arguing that the personality characteristics of black-market offenders were equally likely to explain their behaviours. Clinard later made significant and long-standing contributions to the study of white-collar and corporate crime through his research with American philosopher and criminologist  . Clinard’s early education was at  , and his doctoral training occurred at the famous “Chicago School,” officially the Department of   at the  , where he received a Ph.D. in sociology in 1941. He was a highly distinguished scholar in the   of sociology and the subfield of  . Clinard held academic positions at several universities, including the  , the  , and  . In 1957 he published  , which became a leading textbook in the fields of sociology and criminology. In the latter part of the 20th century, while at the University of Wisconsin– , Clinard worked with   to resolve ongoing definitional disputes, and their efforts resulted in the widely accepted division of white-collar crime into two distinct forms: corporate crime, which occurs on behalf of a corporation and benefits the corporation, and occupational  , which is committed by individuals against their employing organizations, and benefits the individual offender. This typology   the appropriate unit of analysis for white-collar crime research: either the corporation or the individual. As a result, additional white-collar crime research focused on either corporate crime or occupational crime. This did not solve the definitional debates, but at least it added   clarity to the field. A subsequent research contribution made by Clinard resulted from his collaboration with American sociologist  Peter Cleary Yeager on a study that was published in two forms:   (1979) and   (1980). In the Sutherland tradition, Clinard and Yeager examined crimes committed by the 477 largest manufacturing corporations and the 105 largest wholesale, retail, and service corporations in the   in the years 1975 and 1976. In that two-year time frame, these 582 corporations were the target of 1,553 federal cases. The   of the study were staggering: due to the fact that the numbers were based only on cases brought against the corporations, they underestimated the true, total amount of corporate crime. To use the authors’ terms, the findings were merely “the tip of the iceberg.” The results confirmed Sutherland’s principal finding: corporations violate the law with great frequency. The results of these studies continue to provide a valuable   for researchers examining corporate crime. In the course of his long and prominent career, Clinard wrote or cowrote more than 10 books, 40 articles, and 25 book chapters. His awards were numerous, and he was honoured by many leading academic and professional organizations in sociology, criminology, and white-collar crime, including the Academy of Criminal   Sciences, the American Society of Criminology, the American Sociological Association, and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.

Ray Kurzweil is an American computer scientist and futurist who pioneered   technology and proselytized the inevitability of humanity’s merger with the technology it created. It was Kurzweil’s belief that pattern recognition formed the basis of human thought. In an   in 2018 for the  , he sees the convergence of humans and machines as a given that will have great benefits: “we will ultimately merge with our machines, live indefinitely, and be a billion times more intelligent…all within the next three to four decades.”  (born February 12, 1948,  ,  , U.S.) American computer scientist and futurist who pioneered     and   the inevitability of humanity’s merger with the technology it created. Kurzweil was raised in a   Jewish family in Queens, New York. His parents fostered an early interest in  , allowing him to work as a computer programmer for the Head Start program at age 14. In 1965 he earned first prize in the International Science Fair with a   that could write music that mimicked the styles of great composers. The program marked the beginning of his career-long attempt to re-create  , or the ability to find order in complex data. It was Kurzweil’s belief that pattern recognition formed the basis of human thought. As a student at the   (MIT), Kurzweil created a computer program that helped high-school students choose a college to  . He then sold the service to a publisher for $100,000 plus royalties. He graduated from MIT in 1970 with a   in   and literature. Four years later he established Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc., which developed technology that allowed computers to read text printed in any normal typeface. Under Kurzweil’s direction, the company also pioneered a flatbed scanner and a text-to-speech synthesizer and used all three inventions to build a reading machine for the blind. A commercial version of the machine was developed, which led to the sale of the company to the   in 1980; Kurzweil was a consultant for Xerox until 1995. A friendship with musician   led Kurzweil to launch a business that created professional-quality music synthesizers in 1982. That   was sold to the Korean instrument manufacturer Young Chang in 1990. In 1987 another company founded by Kurzweil spawned the first commercial   system and in 1997 was sold to a concern that later teamed with the   to market speech-recognition   for  . In 1997 and 1999 he founded firms that produced software using   for financial analysis and medical training. Kurzweil also explored the possibilities of technology in creating art, founding a company in 1998 that produced software capable of creating paintings and poetry. His  , KurzweilAI.net, was founded in 2001 and featured articles on the future of technology, as well as Ramona, a   woman who   with users. In 2003 Kurzweil cofounded a company that sold nutritional supplements aimed at extending the human life span, and in 2005 he cofounded a company that released a handheld print reader for the blind. Kurzweil attracted the attention of the general public with his daring prognostications about how technology would shape the future. He explicated an array of prescient theories in   (1990), which anticipated the explosion in popularity of the Internet. Kurzweil also wrote   (1993), which details a diet that he had used to help cure himself of diabetes. His book   (1999) presents a vision of the 21st century as a time when computer technology would have advanced far enough to allow machines to operate on a level equivalent to that of the human brain. Computers, he predicted, would make complex decisions, appreciate beauty, and even experience emotions. Moreover, Kurzweil believed that as humans transferred the information in their brains to computers, the distinction between man and machine would become blurred. He further augured the convergence of human life with technology in   (2004), coauthored with Terry Grossman, and   (2005).   (2009), a documentary, chronicles Kurzweil’s life and features interviews with both supporters and detractors of his predictions. In 2000 Kurzweil was awarded the U.S. National Medal of Technology in recognition of his many  . He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, established by the U.S. Patent Office, in 2002.

Some die after only a brief existence, like that of the  , whose adult life burns out in a day, and others like that of the gnarled bristlecone pines, which have lived thousands of years. The limits of the   of each   appear to be determined ultimately by  . Locked within the code of the genetic material are instructions that specify the   beyond which a species cannot live given even the most favourable conditions. And many environmental factors act to diminish that upper age limit. The maximum life span is a theoretical number whose exact value cannot be determined from existing knowledge about an organism; it is often given as a rough estimate based on the longest-lived organism of its species known to date. A more meaningful measure is the average life span; this is a   concept that is derived by the analysis of   data for populations of each species. A related term is the expectation of  , a   number computed for humans from mortality tables drawn up by   companies. Life expectancy represents the average number of years that a group of persons, all born at the same time, might be expected to live, and it is based on the changing death rate over many past years. The concept of life span implies that there is an individual whose existence has a definite beginning and end. What   the individual in most cases presents no problem: among organisms that reproduce sexually the individual is a certain amount of living substance capable of maintaining itself alive and endowed with hereditary features that are in some measure unique. In some organisms, however, extensive and apparently indefinite   takes place and   may occur by division of a single parent organism, as in many protists, including bacteria, algae, and protozoans. If these divisions are incomplete, a   results; if the parts separate, genetically   organisms are formed. In order to consider life span in such organisms, the individual must be defined arbitrarily since the organisms are continually dividing. In a strict sense, the life spans in such instances are not comparable to those forms that are sexually produced. The beginning of an organism can be defined by the formation of the fertilized egg in sexual forms; or by the physical separation of the new organism in asexual forms (many invertebrate animals and many plants). In animals generally, birth is considered to be the beginning of the life span. The timing of birth, however, is so different in various animals that it is only a poor  . In many marine invertebrates the hatchling larva consists of relatively few cells, not nearly so far along toward adulthood as a newborn  . For even among mammals, variations are considerable. A kangaroo at birth is about an inch long and must develop further in the pouch, hardly comparable to a newborn deer, who within minutes is walking about. If   of different kinds of organisms are to be compared, it is essential that these variations be accounted for. The end of an organism’s existence results when irreversible changes have occurred to such an extent that the individual no longer actively retains its organization. There is thus a brief period during which it is impossible to say whether the organism is still alive, but this time is so short relative to the total length of life that it creates no great problem in determining life span. Some organisms seem to be potentially immortal. Unless an accident puts an end to life, they appear to be fully capable of surviving indefinitely. This   has been attributed to certain fishes and reptiles, which appear to be capable of unlimited growth. Without examining the various causes of death in detail (   ) a distinction can be made between death as a result of internal changes (i.e.,  ) and death as a result of some purely external factor, such as an accident. It is notable that the absence of aging processes is correlated with the absence of individuality. In other words, organisms in which the individual is difficult to define, as in colonial forms, appear not to age. Plants grow old as surely as do animals. However, a generally accepted definition of age in plants has not   been realized. If the age of an individual   is that time interval between the reproductive process that gave rise to the individual and the death of the individual, the age attained may be given readily for some kinds of plants but not for others. The  Table lists maximum ages, both estimated and verified, for some seed plants. An   that has 1,000   rings in the trunk is 1,000 years old. But age is less certain in the case of an arctic lupine that germinated from a seed that, containing the embryo, had been lying in a lemming’s burrow in the arctic permafrost for 10,000 years. The mushroom caps that appear overnight last for only a few days, but the network of fungus filaments in the soil (the  ) may be as old as 400 years. Because of important differences in structure, the life span of higher plants cannot be compared with that of higher animals. Normally, embryonic cells (that is, cells capable of changing in form or becoming specialized) cease to exist very early in the life of an animal. In plants, however, embryonic tissue—the plant  —may contribute to growth and   formation for a much longer time, in some cases throughout the life of the plant. Thus the oldest known trees,   of California and Nevada, have one meristem (the cambium) that has been adding cells to the diameter of these trees for, in many cases, more than 4,000 years and another meristem (the apical) that has been adding cells to the length of these trees for the same period. These meristematic tissues are as old as the plant itself; they were formed in the embryo. The wood, bark, leaves and cones, however, live for only a few years. The wood of the trunk and roots, although dead, remains a part of the tree indefinitely, but the bark, leaves, and cones are continually in the process of dying and   off. Among the lower plants only a few   possess structures that enable an estimate of their age to be made. The   ( ) grows through its own stem tip each year, leaving a ring of scales that marks the annual growth. Three to five years’ growth in this moss is common, but life spans of 10 years have been recorded. The lower portions of such a moss are dead, though intact.   ( ) forms extensive growths that fill acid bogs with a peaty turf consisting of the dead lower portions of mosses whose living tops continue growing. Mosses that become encrusted with lime (calcium carbonate) and form “tufa” beds several metres thick also have living tips and dead lower portions. On the basis of their observed annual growth, some tufa mosses are estimated to have been growing for as long as 2,800 years. No reliable method for determining the age of   exists, but on the basis of size attained and growth rate, some tree ferns are thought to be several decades old. Some  , or lycopsids, have a “storied” growth pattern similar to that of the haircap moss. Under favourable conditions some specimens live five to seven years. The woody seed plants, such as   and broadleaf  , are the most   to determination of age. In   regions, where each year’s growth is brought to an end by cold or dryness, every growth period is limited by an  —a new layer of wood added to the diameter of the tree. These rings may be counted on the cut ends of a tree that has been felled or, using a special instrument, a cylinder of wood can be cut out and the growth rings counted and studied. In the far north growth rings are so close together that they are difficult to count. In the moist tropics growth is more or less  , so that clearly defined rings are difficult to find. Often the age of a tree is estimated on the basis of its diameter, especially when the average annual increase in diameter is known. The source of greatest error in this method is the not infrequent fusing of the trunks of more than one tree, as, for example, occurred in a Montezuma   in Santa María del Tule, a little Mexican village near Oaxaca. This tree, described by the Spanish explorer   in the early 1500s, was earlier estimated on the basis of its great thickness to be 6,000 years old; later studies, however, proved it to be three trees grown together. Estimates of the age of some   have been as high as 3,000 years, but these figures, too, have turned out to be based on the fusion of close-growing trunks, none of which is more than 250 years old.   borings of bristlecone pines have shown specimens in the western   to be 4,600 years old. Plants, usually herbaceous, that live for only one   and produce flowers and seeds in that time are called annuals. They may be represented by such plants as corn and marigolds, which spend a period of a few weeks to a few months rapidly accumulating food materials. As a result of hormonal changes—brought about in many plants by changes in environmental factors such as day length and temperature—leaf-producing tissues change abruptly to flower-producing ones. The formation of flowers, fruits, and seeds rapidly depletes food reserves and the vegetative portion of the plant usually dies. Although the exhaustion of food reserves often accompanies death of the plant, it is not necessarily the cause of death. These plants, too, are usually herbaceous. They live for two growing seasons. During the first season, food is accumulated, usually in a thickened root (beets, carrots); flowering occurs in the second season. As in annuals, flowering exhausts the food reserves, and the plants die after the seeds mature. These plants have a life span of several to many years. Some are herbaceous (iris, delphinium), others are shrubs or trees. The   differ from the above-mentioned groups in that the storage structures are either permanent or are renewed each year. Perennials require from one to many years growth before flowering. The preflowering (juvenile) period is usually shorter in trees and shrubs with shorter life spans than in those with longer life spans. The long-lived beech tree ( ), for example, passes 30–40 years in the juvenile stage, during which time there is rapid growth but no flowering. Some plants—cotton and tomatoes, for example—are perennials in their native tropical regions but are capable of blooming and producing fruits, seeds, or other useful parts in their first year. Such plants are often grown as annuals in the   zones. Although there is great variety in the longevity of seeds, the dormant   plant contained within the seed will lose its viability (ability to grow) if   fails to occur within a certain time. Reports of the sprouting of wheat taken from Egyptian tombs are unfounded, but some seeds do retain their viability a long time.   seeds (actually fruits) have the longest known retention of viability. On the other hand, seeds of some willows lose their ability to germinate within a week after they have reached maturity. The loss of viability of seeds in storage, although hastened or retarded by environmental factors, is the result of changes that take place within the seed itself. The changes that have been investigated are: exhaustion of food supply; gradual denaturing or loss of   structure by protoplasmic proteins; breakdown of enzymes; accumulation of toxins resulting from the   of the seed. Some self-produced toxins may cause mutations that hamper seed germination. Since seeds of different species vary greatly in structure, physiology, and life history, no single set of age factors can apply to all seeds.

Mind is in some sense reflected in such occurrences as sensations, perceptions, emotions, memory, desires, various types of  , motives, choices, traits of  , and the  . A brief treatment of mind follows. The subject of mind is treated in a number of articles. For a philosophical treatment of Western  ,    . For scientific treatment of the so-called mental faculties,    ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  . For treatment of Eastern conceptions, in the   of the respective philosophical traditions,    ;  ; etc. To the extent that mind is   in observable phenomena, it has frequently been regarded as a peculiarly   possession. Some theories, however, posit the existence of mind in other animals besides human beings. One theory regards mind as a universal property of matter. According to another view, there may be superhuman minds or intelligences, or a single absolute mind, a   intelligence. Several assumptions are indispensible to any discussion of the concept of mind. First is the assumption of   or thinking. If there were no evidence of thought in the world, mind would have little or no meaning. The   of this fact throughout history accounts for the development of   theories of mind. It may be supposed that such words as “thought” or “thinking” cannot, because of their own  , help to define the sphere of mind. But whatever the relation of thinking to  , thinking seems to involve more—for almost all observers—than a mere reception of impressions from without. This seems to be the opinion of those who make thinking a consequence of sensing, as well as of those who regard thought as independent of sense. For both, thinking goes beyond sensing, either as an elaboration of the materials of sense or as an   of objects that are totally beyond the reach of the senses. The second assumption that seems to be a root common to all conceptions of mind is that of   or knowing. This may be questioned on the ground that, if there were   without any form of thought, judgment, or reasoning, there would be at least a   form of knowledge—some degree of   or awareness by one thing or another. If one grants the point of this objection, it nevertheless seems true that the distinction between truth and falsity and the difference between knowledge, error, and ignorance or between knowledge, belief, and opinion do not apply to sensations in the total absence of thought. Any understanding of knowledge that involves these distinctions seems to imply mind for the same reason that it implies thought. There is a further   of mind in the fact of self-knowledge. Sensing may be awareness of an object, and to this extent it may be a kind of knowing, but it has never been observed that the senses can sense or be aware of themselves. Thought seems to be not only reflective but reflexive, that is, able to consider itself, to define the nature of thinking, and to develop theories of mind. This fact about thought—its reflexivity—also seems to be a common element in all the meanings of “mind.” It is sometimes referred to as “the reflexivity of the intellect,” as “the reflexive power of the understanding,” as “the ability of the understanding to reflect upon its own acts,” or as “self-consciousness.” Whatever the phrasing, a world without   or self-knowledge would be a world in which the traditional   of mind would probably not have arisen. The third assumption is that of purpose or  , of planning a course of action with foreknowledge of its goal or of working in any other way toward a desired and foreseen objective. As in the case of sensitivity, the phenomena of desire do not, without further qualification, indicate the realm of mind. According to the theory of natural desire, for example, the natural tendencies of even inanimate and insensitive things are expressions of desire. But it is not in that sense of desire that the assumption of purpose or intention is here taken as evidence of mind. It is rather on the level of the behaviour of living things that purpose seems to require a factor over and above the senses, limited as they are to present appearances. It cannot be found in the passions, which have the same limitation as the senses, for unless they are checked they tend toward immediate emotional discharge. That factor, called for by the direction of conduct to future ends, is either an element common to all meanings of “mind” or is at least an element associated with mind. It is sometimes called the faculty of will—rational desire or the   appetite. Sometimes it is treated as the act of willing, which, along with thinking, is one of the two major activities of mind or understanding; and sometimes purposiveness is regarded as the very essence of mentality. These assumptions—thought, knowledge or self-knowledge, and purpose—seem to be common to all theories of mind. More than that, they seem to be assumptions that require the development of the conception. The   of theories concerning what the human mind is, what structure it has, what parts belong to it, and what whole it belongs to does not   the entire range of controversy on the subject. Yet enough is common to all theories of mind to permit certain other questions to be formulated: How does the mind operate? How does it do whatever is its work, and with what   excellences or defects? What is the relation of mind to matter, to bodily organs, to material conditions, or of one mind to another (   )? Is mind a common possession of men and animals, or is whatever might be called mind in animals distinctly different from the human mind? Are there minds or a mind in existence apart from man and the whole world of corporeal life? What are the limits of so-called  , the capacity of machines to perform functions generally associated with mind? The intelligibility of the positions taken in the disputes of these issues depends to some degree on the divergent conceptions of the human mind from which they stem. The conclusions achieved in such fields as theory of knowledge (   ),  , logic,  , and the   are all relevant to the   of mind; and its conclusions, in turn, have important   for those fields. Moreover, this   applies as well to its relations to such     as neurology,  ,  , and history.

The origin of the expression   is obscure, but it appears to derive from the practice of using drawings of stylized clouds to denote networks in diagrams of computing and communications systems. The term came into popular use in 2008, though the practice of providing remote access to computing functions through networks dates back to the     systems of the 1960s and 1970s. In his 1966 book  , the Canadian electrical engineer Douglas F. Parkhill predicted that the computer industry would come to resemble a   “in which many remotely located users are connected via   links to a central computing facility.” For decades, efforts to create large-scale computer   were frustrated by constraints on the capacity of   such as the telephone system. It was cheaper and easier for companies and other organizations to store data and run applications on private computing systems maintained within their own facilities. The constraints on network capacity began to be removed in the 1990s when telecommunications companies invested in high-capacity   networks in response to the rapidly growing use of the Internet as a shared network for exchanging information. In the late 1990s, a number of companies, called  application service providers (ASPs), were founded to supply computer applications to companies over the Internet. Most of the early ASPs failed, but their model of supplying applications remotely became popular a decade later, when it was renamed cloud computing. Cloud computing   a number of different services. One set of services, sometimes called   (SaaS), involves the supply of a discrete application to outside users. The application can be geared either to business users (such as an accounting application) or to consumers (such as an application for storing and sharing personal photographs). Another set of services, variously called utility computing, grid computing, and hardware as a service (HaaS), involves the provision of computer processing and data storage to outside users, who are able to run their own applications and store their own data on the remote system. A third set of services, sometimes called platform as a service (PaaS), involves the supply of remote computing   along with a set of software-development tools for use by outside software programmers. Early pioneers of cloud computing include  , which supplies a popular business application for managing sales and marketing efforts;  , which in addition to its   supplies an array of applications, known as  , to consumers and businesses; and Amazon Web Services, a division of online retailer  , which offers access to its computing system to Web-site developers and other companies and individuals. Cloud computing also underpins popular   and other online media sites such as  ,  , and  . Traditional software companies, including  ,  ,  , and  , have also introduced cloud applications. Cloud-computing companies either charge users for their services, through subscriptions and usage fees, or provide free access to the services and charge companies for placing advertisements in the services. Because the profitability of cloud services tends to be much lower than the profitability of selling or licensing hardware components and software programs, it is viewed as a potential threat to the businesses of many traditional computing companies. Construction of the large data centres that run cloud-computing services often requires investments of hundreds of millions of dollars. The centres typically contain thousands of   computers networked together into parallel-processing or grid-computing systems. The centres also often employ sophisticated virtualization technologies, which allow computer systems to be divided into many virtual machines that can be rented temporarily to customers. Because of their intensive use of electricity, the centres are often located near hydroelectric dams or other sources of cheap and plentiful  . Because cloud computing involves the storage of often sensitive personal or commercial information in central   systems run by third parties, it raises concerns about data privacy and security as well as the   of data across national boundaries. It also stirs fears about the eventual creation of data monopolies or oligopolies. Some believe that cloud computing will, like other public utilities, come to be heavily regulated by governments.

Ray Kurzweil is an American computer scientist and futurist who pioneered   technology and proselytized the inevitability of humanity’s merger with the technology it created. It was Kurzweil’s belief that pattern recognition formed the basis of human thought. In an   in 2018 for the  , he sees the convergence of humans and machines as a given that will have great benefits: “we will ultimately merge with our machines, live indefinitely, and be a billion times more intelligent…all within the next three to four decades.”  (born February 12, 1948,  ,  , U.S.) American computer scientist and futurist who pioneered     and   the inevitability of humanity’s merger with the technology it created. Kurzweil was raised in a   Jewish family in Queens, New York. His parents fostered an early interest in  , allowing him to work as a computer programmer for the Head Start program at age 14. In 1965 he earned first prize in the International Science Fair with a   that could write music that mimicked the styles of great composers. The program marked the beginning of his career-long attempt to re-create  , or the ability to find order in complex data. It was Kurzweil’s belief that pattern recognition formed the basis of human thought. As a student at the   (MIT), Kurzweil created a computer program that helped high-school students choose a college to  . He then sold the service to a publisher for $100,000 plus royalties. He graduated from MIT in 1970 with a   in   and literature. Four years later he established Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc., which developed technology that allowed computers to read text printed in any normal typeface. Under Kurzweil’s direction, the company also pioneered a flatbed scanner and a text-to-speech synthesizer and used all three inventions to build a reading machine for the blind. A commercial version of the machine was developed, which led to the sale of the company to the   in 1980; Kurzweil was a consultant for Xerox until 1995. A friendship with musician   led Kurzweil to launch a business that created professional-quality music synthesizers in 1982. That   was sold to the Korean instrument manufacturer Young Chang in 1990. In 1987 another company founded by Kurzweil spawned the first commercial   system and in 1997 was sold to a concern that later teamed with the   to market speech-recognition   for  . In 1997 and 1999 he founded firms that produced software using   for financial analysis and medical training. Kurzweil also explored the possibilities of technology in creating art, founding a company in 1998 that produced software capable of creating paintings and poetry. His  , KurzweilAI.net, was founded in 2001 and featured articles on the future of technology, as well as Ramona, a   woman who   with users. In 2003 Kurzweil cofounded a company that sold nutritional supplements aimed at extending the human life span, and in 2005 he cofounded a company that released a handheld print reader for the blind. Kurzweil attracted the attention of the general public with his daring prognostications about how technology would shape the future. He explicated an array of prescient theories in   (1990), which anticipated the explosion in popularity of the Internet. Kurzweil also wrote   (1993), which details a diet that he had used to help cure himself of diabetes. His book   (1999) presents a vision of the 21st century as a time when computer technology would have advanced far enough to allow machines to operate on a level equivalent to that of the human brain. Computers, he predicted, would make complex decisions, appreciate beauty, and even experience emotions. Moreover, Kurzweil believed that as humans transferred the information in their brains to computers, the distinction between man and machine would become blurred. He further augured the convergence of human life with technology in   (2004), coauthored with Terry Grossman, and   (2005).   (2009), a documentary, chronicles Kurzweil’s life and features interviews with both supporters and detractors of his predictions. In 2000 Kurzweil was awarded the U.S. National Medal of Technology in recognition of his many  . He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, established by the U.S. Patent Office, in 2002.

Its survival is dependent on the survival of one piece of hardware. So being able to back up our mind file or most of it will provide significant added protection. But it is not an absolute protection. I won’t be able to come to you at some point in the future and say, “ I’ve done it, I’ve lived forever,” because it is never forever.

Some die after only a brief existence, like that of the  , whose adult life burns out in a day, and others like that of the gnarled bristlecone pines, which have lived thousands of years. The limits of the   of each   appear to be determined ultimately by  . Locked within the code of the genetic material are instructions that specify the   beyond which a species cannot live given even the most favourable conditions. And many environmental factors act to diminish that upper age limit. The maximum life span is a theoretical number whose exact value cannot be determined from existing knowledge about an organism; it is often given as a rough estimate based on the longest-lived organism of its species known to date. A more meaningful measure is the average life span; this is a   concept that is derived by the analysis of   data for populations of each species. A related term is the expectation of  , a   number computed for humans from mortality tables drawn up by   companies. Life expectancy represents the average number of years that a group of persons, all born at the same time, might be expected to live, and it is based on the changing death rate over many past years. The concept of life span implies that there is an individual whose existence has a definite beginning and end. What   the individual in most cases presents no problem: among organisms that reproduce sexually the individual is a certain amount of living substance capable of maintaining itself alive and endowed with hereditary features that are in some measure unique. In some organisms, however, extensive and apparently indefinite   takes place and   may occur by division of a single parent organism, as in many protists, including bacteria, algae, and protozoans. If these divisions are incomplete, a   results; if the parts separate, genetically   organisms are formed. In order to consider life span in such organisms, the individual must be defined arbitrarily since the organisms are continually dividing. In a strict sense, the life spans in such instances are not comparable to those forms that are sexually produced. The beginning of an organism can be defined by the formation of the fertilized egg in sexual forms; or by the physical separation of the new organism in asexual forms (many invertebrate animals and many plants). In animals generally, birth is considered to be the beginning of the life span. The timing of birth, however, is so different in various animals that it is only a poor  . In many marine invertebrates the hatchling larva consists of relatively few cells, not nearly so far along toward adulthood as a newborn  . For even among mammals, variations are considerable. A kangaroo at birth is about an inch long and must develop further in the pouch, hardly comparable to a newborn deer, who within minutes is walking about. If   of different kinds of organisms are to be compared, it is essential that these variations be accounted for. The end of an organism’s existence results when irreversible changes have occurred to such an extent that the individual no longer actively retains its organization. There is thus a brief period during which it is impossible to say whether the organism is still alive, but this time is so short relative to the total length of life that it creates no great problem in determining life span. Some organisms seem to be potentially immortal. Unless an accident puts an end to life, they appear to be fully capable of surviving indefinitely. This   has been attributed to certain fishes and reptiles, which appear to be capable of unlimited growth. Without examining the various causes of death in detail (   ) a distinction can be made between death as a result of internal changes (i.e.,  ) and death as a result of some purely external factor, such as an accident. It is notable that the absence of aging processes is correlated with the absence of individuality. In other words, organisms in which the individual is difficult to define, as in colonial forms, appear not to age. Plants grow old as surely as do animals. However, a generally accepted definition of age in plants has not   been realized. If the age of an individual   is that time interval between the reproductive process that gave rise to the individual and the death of the individual, the age attained may be given readily for some kinds of plants but not for others. The  Table lists maximum ages, both estimated and verified, for some seed plants. An   that has 1,000   rings in the trunk is 1,000 years old. But age is less certain in the case of an arctic lupine that germinated from a seed that, containing the embryo, had been lying in a lemming’s burrow in the arctic permafrost for 10,000 years. The mushroom caps that appear overnight last for only a few days, but the network of fungus filaments in the soil (the  ) may be as old as 400 years. Because of important differences in structure, the life span of higher plants cannot be compared with that of higher animals. Normally, embryonic cells (that is, cells capable of changing in form or becoming specialized) cease to exist very early in the life of an animal. In plants, however, embryonic tissue—the plant  —may contribute to growth and   formation for a much longer time, in some cases throughout the life of the plant. Thus the oldest known trees,   of California and Nevada, have one meristem (the cambium) that has been adding cells to the diameter of these trees for, in many cases, more than 4,000 years and another meristem (the apical) that has been adding cells to the length of these trees for the same period. These meristematic tissues are as old as the plant itself; they were formed in the embryo. The wood, bark, leaves and cones, however, live for only a few years. The wood of the trunk and roots, although dead, remains a part of the tree indefinitely, but the bark, leaves, and cones are continually in the process of dying and   off. Among the lower plants only a few   possess structures that enable an estimate of their age to be made. The   ( ) grows through its own stem tip each year, leaving a ring of scales that marks the annual growth. Three to five years’ growth in this moss is common, but life spans of 10 years have been recorded. The lower portions of such a moss are dead, though intact.   ( ) forms extensive growths that fill acid bogs with a peaty turf consisting of the dead lower portions of mosses whose living tops continue growing. Mosses that become encrusted with lime (calcium carbonate) and form “tufa” beds several metres thick also have living tips and dead lower portions. On the basis of their observed annual growth, some tufa mosses are estimated to have been growing for as long as 2,800 years. No reliable method for determining the age of   exists, but on the basis of size attained and growth rate, some tree ferns are thought to be several decades old. Some  , or lycopsids, have a “storied” growth pattern similar to that of the haircap moss. Under favourable conditions some specimens live five to seven years. The woody seed plants, such as   and broadleaf  , are the most   to determination of age. In   regions, where each year’s growth is brought to an end by cold or dryness, every growth period is limited by an  —a new layer of wood added to the diameter of the tree. These rings may be counted on the cut ends of a tree that has been felled or, using a special instrument, a cylinder of wood can be cut out and the growth rings counted and studied. In the far north growth rings are so close together that they are difficult to count. In the moist tropics growth is more or less  , so that clearly defined rings are difficult to find. Often the age of a tree is estimated on the basis of its diameter, especially when the average annual increase in diameter is known. The source of greatest error in this method is the not infrequent fusing of the trunks of more than one tree, as, for example, occurred in a Montezuma   in Santa María del Tule, a little Mexican village near Oaxaca. This tree, described by the Spanish explorer   in the early 1500s, was earlier estimated on the basis of its great thickness to be 6,000 years old; later studies, however, proved it to be three trees grown together. Estimates of the age of some   have been as high as 3,000 years, but these figures, too, have turned out to be based on the fusion of close-growing trunks, none of which is more than 250 years old.   borings of bristlecone pines have shown specimens in the western   to be 4,600 years old. Plants, usually herbaceous, that live for only one   and produce flowers and seeds in that time are called annuals. They may be represented by such plants as corn and marigolds, which spend a period of a few weeks to a few months rapidly accumulating food materials. As a result of hormonal changes—brought about in many plants by changes in environmental factors such as day length and temperature—leaf-producing tissues change abruptly to flower-producing ones. The formation of flowers, fruits, and seeds rapidly depletes food reserves and the vegetative portion of the plant usually dies. Although the exhaustion of food reserves often accompanies death of the plant, it is not necessarily the cause of death. These plants, too, are usually herbaceous. They live for two growing seasons. During the first season, food is accumulated, usually in a thickened root (beets, carrots); flowering occurs in the second season. As in annuals, flowering exhausts the food reserves, and the plants die after the seeds mature. These plants have a life span of several to many years. Some are herbaceous (iris, delphinium), others are shrubs or trees. The   differ from the above-mentioned groups in that the storage structures are either permanent or are renewed each year. Perennials require from one to many years growth before flowering. The preflowering (juvenile) period is usually shorter in trees and shrubs with shorter life spans than in those with longer life spans. The long-lived beech tree ( ), for example, passes 30–40 years in the juvenile stage, during which time there is rapid growth but no flowering. Some plants—cotton and tomatoes, for example—are perennials in their native tropical regions but are capable of blooming and producing fruits, seeds, or other useful parts in their first year. Such plants are often grown as annuals in the   zones. Although there is great variety in the longevity of seeds, the dormant   plant contained within the seed will lose its viability (ability to grow) if   fails to occur within a certain time. Reports of the sprouting of wheat taken from Egyptian tombs are unfounded, but some seeds do retain their viability a long time.   seeds (actually fruits) have the longest known retention of viability. On the other hand, seeds of some willows lose their ability to germinate within a week after they have reached maturity. The loss of viability of seeds in storage, although hastened or retarded by environmental factors, is the result of changes that take place within the seed itself. The changes that have been investigated are: exhaustion of food supply; gradual denaturing or loss of   structure by protoplasmic proteins; breakdown of enzymes; accumulation of toxins resulting from the   of the seed. Some self-produced toxins may cause mutations that hamper seed germination. Since seeds of different species vary greatly in structure, physiology, and life history, no single set of age factors can apply to all seeds.

Mind is in some sense reflected in such occurrences as sensations, perceptions, emotions, memory, desires, various types of  , motives, choices, traits of  , and the  . A brief treatment of mind follows. The subject of mind is treated in a number of articles. For a philosophical treatment of Western  ,    . For scientific treatment of the so-called mental faculties,    ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  . For treatment of Eastern conceptions, in the   of the respective philosophical traditions,    ;  ; etc. To the extent that mind is   in observable phenomena, it has frequently been regarded as a peculiarly   possession. Some theories, however, posit the existence of mind in other animals besides human beings. One theory regards mind as a universal property of matter. According to another view, there may be superhuman minds or intelligences, or a single absolute mind, a   intelligence. Several assumptions are indispensible to any discussion of the concept of mind. First is the assumption of   or thinking. If there were no evidence of thought in the world, mind would have little or no meaning. The   of this fact throughout history accounts for the development of   theories of mind. It may be supposed that such words as “thought” or “thinking” cannot, because of their own  , help to define the sphere of mind. But whatever the relation of thinking to  , thinking seems to involve more—for almost all observers—than a mere reception of impressions from without. This seems to be the opinion of those who make thinking a consequence of sensing, as well as of those who regard thought as independent of sense. For both, thinking goes beyond sensing, either as an elaboration of the materials of sense or as an   of objects that are totally beyond the reach of the senses. The second assumption that seems to be a root common to all conceptions of mind is that of   or knowing. This may be questioned on the ground that, if there were   without any form of thought, judgment, or reasoning, there would be at least a   form of knowledge—some degree of   or awareness by one thing or another. If one grants the point of this objection, it nevertheless seems true that the distinction between truth and falsity and the difference between knowledge, error, and ignorance or between knowledge, belief, and opinion do not apply to sensations in the total absence of thought. Any understanding of knowledge that involves these distinctions seems to imply mind for the same reason that it implies thought. There is a further   of mind in the fact of self-knowledge. Sensing may be awareness of an object, and to this extent it may be a kind of knowing, but it has never been observed that the senses can sense or be aware of themselves. Thought seems to be not only reflective but reflexive, that is, able to consider itself, to define the nature of thinking, and to develop theories of mind. This fact about thought—its reflexivity—also seems to be a common element in all the meanings of “mind.” It is sometimes referred to as “the reflexivity of the intellect,” as “the reflexive power of the understanding,” as “the ability of the understanding to reflect upon its own acts,” or as “self-consciousness.” Whatever the phrasing, a world without   or self-knowledge would be a world in which the traditional   of mind would probably not have arisen. The third assumption is that of purpose or  , of planning a course of action with foreknowledge of its goal or of working in any other way toward a desired and foreseen objective. As in the case of sensitivity, the phenomena of desire do not, without further qualification, indicate the realm of mind. According to the theory of natural desire, for example, the natural tendencies of even inanimate and insensitive things are expressions of desire. But it is not in that sense of desire that the assumption of purpose or intention is here taken as evidence of mind. It is rather on the level of the behaviour of living things that purpose seems to require a factor over and above the senses, limited as they are to present appearances. It cannot be found in the passions, which have the same limitation as the senses, for unless they are checked they tend toward immediate emotional discharge. That factor, called for by the direction of conduct to future ends, is either an element common to all meanings of “mind” or is at least an element associated with mind. It is sometimes called the faculty of will—rational desire or the   appetite. Sometimes it is treated as the act of willing, which, along with thinking, is one of the two major activities of mind or understanding; and sometimes purposiveness is regarded as the very essence of mentality. These assumptions—thought, knowledge or self-knowledge, and purpose—seem to be common to all theories of mind. More than that, they seem to be assumptions that require the development of the conception. The   of theories concerning what the human mind is, what structure it has, what parts belong to it, and what whole it belongs to does not   the entire range of controversy on the subject. Yet enough is common to all theories of mind to permit certain other questions to be formulated: How does the mind operate? How does it do whatever is its work, and with what   excellences or defects? What is the relation of mind to matter, to bodily organs, to material conditions, or of one mind to another (   )? Is mind a common possession of men and animals, or is whatever might be called mind in animals distinctly different from the human mind? Are there minds or a mind in existence apart from man and the whole world of corporeal life? What are the limits of so-called  , the capacity of machines to perform functions generally associated with mind? The intelligibility of the positions taken in the disputes of these issues depends to some degree on the divergent conceptions of the human mind from which they stem. The conclusions achieved in such fields as theory of knowledge (   ),  , logic,  , and the   are all relevant to the   of mind; and its conclusions, in turn, have important   for those fields. Moreover, this   applies as well to its relations to such     as neurology,  ,  , and history.

The origin of the expression   is obscure, but it appears to derive from the practice of using drawings of stylized clouds to denote networks in diagrams of computing and communications systems. The term came into popular use in 2008, though the practice of providing remote access to computing functions through networks dates back to the     systems of the 1960s and 1970s. In his 1966 book  , the Canadian electrical engineer Douglas F. Parkhill predicted that the computer industry would come to resemble a   “in which many remotely located users are connected via   links to a central computing facility.” For decades, efforts to create large-scale computer   were frustrated by constraints on the capacity of   such as the telephone system. It was cheaper and easier for companies and other organizations to store data and run applications on private computing systems maintained within their own facilities. The constraints on network capacity began to be removed in the 1990s when telecommunications companies invested in high-capacity   networks in response to the rapidly growing use of the Internet as a shared network for exchanging information. In the late 1990s, a number of companies, called  application service providers (ASPs), were founded to supply computer applications to companies over the Internet. Most of the early ASPs failed, but their model of supplying applications remotely became popular a decade later, when it was renamed cloud computing. Cloud computing   a number of different services. One set of services, sometimes called   (SaaS), involves the supply of a discrete application to outside users. The application can be geared either to business users (such as an accounting application) or to consumers (such as an application for storing and sharing personal photographs). Another set of services, variously called utility computing, grid computing, and hardware as a service (HaaS), involves the provision of computer processing and data storage to outside users, who are able to run their own applications and store their own data on the remote system. A third set of services, sometimes called platform as a service (PaaS), involves the supply of remote computing   along with a set of software-development tools for use by outside software programmers. Early pioneers of cloud computing include  , which supplies a popular business application for managing sales and marketing efforts;  , which in addition to its   supplies an array of applications, known as  , to consumers and businesses; and Amazon Web Services, a division of online retailer  , which offers access to its computing system to Web-site developers and other companies and individuals. Cloud computing also underpins popular   and other online media sites such as  ,  , and  . Traditional software companies, including  ,  ,  , and  , have also introduced cloud applications. Cloud-computing companies either charge users for their services, through subscriptions and usage fees, or provide free access to the services and charge companies for placing advertisements in the services. Because the profitability of cloud services tends to be much lower than the profitability of selling or licensing hardware components and software programs, it is viewed as a potential threat to the businesses of many traditional computing companies. Construction of the large data centres that run cloud-computing services often requires investments of hundreds of millions of dollars. The centres typically contain thousands of   computers networked together into parallel-processing or grid-computing systems. The centres also often employ sophisticated virtualization technologies, which allow computer systems to be divided into many virtual machines that can be rented temporarily to customers. Because of their intensive use of electricity, the centres are often located near hydroelectric dams or other sources of cheap and plentiful  . Because cloud computing involves the storage of often sensitive personal or commercial information in central   systems run by third parties, it raises concerns about data privacy and security as well as the   of data across national boundaries. It also stirs fears about the eventual creation of data monopolies or oligopolies. Some believe that cloud computing will, like other public utilities, come to be heavily regulated by governments.

There are two major determinants of   sexual activity: the inherited sexual response patterns that have evolved as a means of ensuring reproduction and that are a part of each individual’s genetic inheritance, and the degree of restraint or other types of influence exerted on individuals by society in the expression of their  . The objective here is to describe and explain both sets of factors and their interaction. It should be noted that taboos in Western   and the immaturity of the social sciences for a long time impeded research concerning human sexual activity, so that by the early 20th century scientific knowledge was largely restricted to individual case histories that had been studied by such European writers as  ,  , and  . By the 1920s, however, the foundations had been laid for the more extensive statistical studies that were conducted before   in the United States. Of the two major organizations for   study, one, the   in Berlin (established in 1897), was destroyed by the Nazis in 1933. The other, the Institute for Sex Research (later renamed  ), begun in 1938 by the American sexologist   at   in Bloomington, undertook the study of human sexual activity. Much of the following discussion rests on the findings of the Institute for Sex Research, which   the most   data available. The only other country for which comprehensive data exist is Sweden. Human sexual activity may conveniently be classified according to the number and   of the participants. There is solitary activity involving only one individual, and there is sociosexual activity involving more than one person. Sociosexual activity is generally divided into heterosexual activity (male with female) and homosexual activity (male with male or female with female). If three or more individuals are involved it is, of course, possible to have heterosexual and homosexual activity simultaneously. In both solitary and sociosexual activity there may be activities that are sufficiently unusual to warrant the label   activity. The term deviant should not be used as a   judgment but simply as indicating that such activity is not common in a particular society. Since human societies differ in their sexual practices, what is deviant in one society may be normal in another. Self-masturbation is self-stimulation with the intention of causing sexual arousal and, generally, orgasm (sexual climax). Most   is done in private as an end in itself but is sometimes practiced to   a sociosexual relationship. Masturbation, generally beginning at or before  , is very common among males, particularly young males, but becomes less frequent or is abandoned when sociosexual activity is available. Consequently, masturbation is most frequent among the unmarried. Fewer females masturbate; in the  , roughly one-half to two-thirds have done so, as compared to nine out of ten males. Females also tend to reduce or discontinue masturbation when they develop sociosexual relationships. There is great individual variation in frequency, so that it is impractical to try to define what range could be considered “normal.” The   persists, despite scientific proof to the contrary, that masturbation is physically harmful. Neither is there evidence that masturbation is immature activity; it is common among adults deprived of sociosexual opportunities. While solitary masturbation does provide pleasure and relief from the tension of sexual excitement, it does not have the same psychological gratification that interaction with another person provides; thus, extremely few people prefer masturbation to sociosexual activity. The psychological significance of masturbation lies in how the individual regards it. For some, it is laden with guilt; for others, it is a release from tension with no emotional content; and for others it is simply another source of pleasure to be enjoyed for its own sake. The majority of males and females have fantasies of some sociosexual activity while they masturbate. The   not infrequently involves idealized sexual partners and activities that the individual has not experienced and even might   in real life. Since the masturbating person is in sole control of the areas that are stimulated, the degree of pressure, and the rapidity of movement, masturbation is often more effective in producing sexual arousal and   than is sociosexual activity, during which the stimulation is determined to some degree by one’s partner. Orgasm in   evidently occurs only in humans. Its causes are not wholly known. The   that it results from the pressure of accumulated   is invalid because not only do nocturnal emissions sometimes occur in males on successive nights, but females experience orgasm in sleep as well. In some cases orgasm in sleep seems a compensatory phenomenon, occurring during times when the individual has been deprived of or   from other sexual activity. In other cases it may result from external stimuli, such as sleeping prone or having night clothing caught between one’s legs. Most orgasms during sleep are accompanied by erotic dreams. A great majority of males experience orgasm in sleep. This almost always begins and is most frequent in adolescence, tending to disappear later in life. Fewer females have orgasm in sleep, and, unlike males, they usually begin having such experience when fully adult. Orgasm in sleep is generally infrequent, seldom exceeding a dozen times per year for males and three or four times a year for the average female. Most sexual arousal does not lead to sexual activity with another individual. Humans are constantly exposed to sexual   when seeing attractive persons and are subjected to sexual themes in advertising and the  . Response to such visual and other stimuli is strongest in adolescence and early adult life and usually gradually declines with advancing age. One of the necessary tasks of growing up is learning to cope with one’s sexual arousal and to achieve some balance between suppression, which can be injurious, and free expression, which can lead to social difficulties. There is great variation among individuals in the strength of   and responsiveness, so this necessary exercise of restraint is correspondingly difficult or easy.

Content:   Several theories of personality development stress that adulthood and aging are periods of qualitative change, of discontinuity, and of transformations of earlier life patterns. These changes are believed to arise in relation to the demands of the person’s changing biological status and social context—the family, the workplace, and society in general. Thus, personality development is both an individual and a social phenomenon.  In the view of Erik Erikson, certain psychosocial demands, or crises, confront the individual at distinct intervals throughout life.

Content:  The very nature of what it means to be  human is being both enriched and challenged, as our species breaks the shackles of its genetic legacy and achieves inconceivable heights of intelligence, material progress, and longevity. The rate of this “paradigm shift” is now doubling every decade, so the 21st century will actually see 20,000 years of progress at today’s pace. Computation, communication, biological technologies (for example, DNA sequencing), brain scanning, knowledge of the human brain, and human knowledge in general are all accelerating at an even faster pace, generally doubling in performance, capacity, and bandwidth every year. Three-dimensional molecular computing will provide the hardware for human-level “strong”   well before 2030. The more important software insights will be gained in part from the reverse-engineering of the human brain, a process well under way. While the social and philosophical ramifications of these changes will be profound, and the threats they pose considerable, we will ultimately merge with our machines, live indefinitely, and be a billion times more intelligent…all within the next three to four decades. We will connect our biological  neocortex to a synthetic neocortex in the  cloud. This will be done by using medical nano-robots that go into the brain through the capillaries and provide wireless communication between our neocortical modules and the cloud in the same way that your smartphone today has wireless communication with the cloud. And the same way that your smartphone today amplifies its capabilities by connecting to many computers in the cloud, we will do the same thing with our neocortex. This is a 2030s and 2040s scenario. Our thinking then will become a hybrid of the biological and nonbiological thinking in the cloud. As a result, we will become smarter, more musical, funnier, etc. But our thinking will become increasingly   as we extend further into the cloud and as the cloud becomes more powerful. Digital processes are inherently backed up, and we in turn will be able to back up our “ mind file” or at least most of it. Being backed up is not an absolute guarantee of “living forever,” which will be clear to anyone who has ever lost a file, but it does provide another layer of protection. I don’t like to speak about immortality but rather indefinite  extensions to the existence of our mind file. The mind file is not just an abstraction—there is literally information in our brains that defines our memories, our skills, and our personality. And it is not backed up today. Its survival is dependent on the survival of one piece of hardware. So being able to back up our mind file or most of it will provide significant added protection. But it is not an absolute protection. I won’t be able to come to you at some point in the future and say, “ I’ve done it, I’ve lived forever,” because it is never forever.

Content: The   is one of the most iconic sculptures in the Western world and is often seen as a symbol of American freedom. Designed and sculpted by French sculptor  , France donated this colossal statue to the United States in 1875 to commemorate their alliance during the  . Formally titled  , the statue depicts a crowned Liberty, personified as a woman, lifting up a torch with her right hand as her left hand clutches a tablet bearing “JULY IV, MDCCLXXVI,” the Roman-numeral date on which the   was adopted. In “The New Colossus,” Emma Lazarus calls her the “Mother of Exiles,” and for Americans new and old, her image has become one of the most recognizable in the world. But what do we know about the real-life woman who inspired Lady Liberty? Answering this question requires going back in Bartholdi’s writings and sketches—not of the Statue of Liberty but of an earlier statue that bears a stark resemblance to his American monument. Bartholdi began to dabble in colossal statuary in the late 1850s, nearly 30 years before the Statue of Liberty was completed. He   as having been informed by classical monuments, like the  . The style he studied “with the greatest attention,” however, was that of the ancient Egyptians. Bartholdi journeyed to Egypt about 1856 and was awestruck at the  , two statues of the pharaoh  . At 70 feet (21 meters) tall, they had towered over the ruins of ancient Thebes for over 3,200 years. Bartholdi wrote that “these granite beings, in their imperturbable majesty, seem to be still listening to the most remote antiquity. Their kindly and impassable glance seems to ignore the present and to be fixed upon an unlimited future….[T]he design itself expresses, after a fashion, infinity.” Bartholdi’s journey to Egypt was enormously transformative and influential. In 1868 he returned to marvel again at the Colossi, and in 1869 Bartholdi submitted a colossal statuary proposal to the Egyptian  ,  . Bartholdi hoped that the khedive would use his sculpture design to commemorate the completion of the  , which had opened that year. As the shortest path between the Mediterranean and Red Seas, the Suez Canal functioned as a literal sea-bridge between Europe and Asia. If selected, Bartholdi hoped that his colossus would be seen as a symbol of cultural progress and understanding.  for the khedive was modeled after a woman  , or Egyptian peasant. Unfortunately, very little is known about this   besides her socioeconomic status; Bartholdi left no records that indicate any interest in her personal story. Despite this, selecting a woman was no accident. Bartholdi was conscious of a centuries-long European artistic tradition of personifying values, ideas, and even countries in the forms of women. These personifications were venerated and sometimes worshipped, but of particular importance for Bartholdi was that they lived and lingered in the minds of those who viewed their likenesses. This logic is clear in the name, form, and function of Bartholdi’s contest submission. Titled  , this colossal woman was to be positioned in the middle of the Suez Canal atop a monumental plinth. Dressed in what Egyptians would have recognized as the clothes of a   and immortalized as a monument, she would have been a point of pride for Egyptians of all social classes. She doubled as a lighthouse, holding a torch up high and radiating light from her head. As ships from countless nations passed beneath her, this woman was to be seen as the physical embodiment of Egypt and its progress. Although Bartholdi’s submission may have impressed the khedive, building the colossus would have been enormously expensive. Egypt was facing financial problems that likely caused the khedive to shift his attention elsewhere, and the project was terminated. But if Bartholdi’s colossal   seems recognizable, that is because he was determined to repurpose his scrapped design. Between 1870 and 1871, he began to alter the details of his sketches. The woman’s characteristic Egyptian dress gave way to Greek robes, and light beamed from her torch instead of her head. A diadem would later replace her head covering, while her left hand soon bore a tablet. But like the sketches from 1869, she still held her torch with an upstretched arm, her other limb positioned at her waist. Beneath what would become America’s   was Egypt’s own colossal  , still “carrying the light.”

(born August 15, 1933,  , New York, U.S.—died December 20, 1984, New York City) American social psychologist known for his controversial and groundbreaking experiments on   to authority. Milgram’s obedience experiments, in addition to other studies that he carried out during his career, generally are considered to have provided important insight into human social behaviour, particularly   and social pressure.    . Milgram was born and raised in the Bronx, the second of three children in a working-class Jewish family. As a youth, he was an exceptional student, with interests in   and the arts. At Queens College (later part of the   [CUNY]), he studied  , in addition to taking courses in art, literature, and music. In 1953, following his third year at the college, he toured Europe and became increasingly interested in  . He was accepted into the graduate program in international affairs at  . However, in 1954, after completing a   in political science at Queens College, Milgram instead began graduate studies in the social relations department at  . At Harvard, Milgram took classes with leading social psychologists of the day, including  ,  , Roger Brown, and  , all of whom greatly influenced the direction of Milgram’s academic career. Of particular interest to Milgram were Asch’s conformity experiments, which showed that individual behaviour can be influenced by  , with individuals conforming to group perspectives, even when choices made by the group are obviously incorrect. Milgram set out to apply Asch’s group technique, with several variations, to the study of conformity on a national level, seeking to explore national  . He focused initially on the   and Norway and later added France, using his connections at Harvard to travel to Oslo and Paris to establish study groups there. He used an auditory task to measure conformity, with participants in closed booths asked to distinguish between the lengths of two tones. Participants also heard the responses of other members of the study group, who supposedly occupied closed booths next to the participant (the group responses were recorded, and the other booths were empty). Milgram’s findings suggested that Americans and Norwegians differed little in conformity rates and that, of the three groups, the French were the least conforming. In 1960, after earning a Ph.D. from Harvard, Milgram accepted a position as assistant professor at  . There he narrowed his research to obedience. Having been acutely aware from his   of his Jewish heritage and the tragedies suffered by Jews in Europe during the  , he was interested in understanding the factors that led people to inflict harm on others. He designed an unprecedented experiment—later known as the  —whereby study subjects, who believed that they were participating in a learning experiment about punishment and  , were instructed by an authority figure (the experimenter) to inflict seemingly painful shocks to a helpless victim (the learner). Both the experimenter and the learner were actors hired by Milgram, and the shocks were simulated via an authentic-appearing shock generator that was equipped with 30 voltage levels, increasing from 15 to 450 volts. Subjects were instructed by the experimenter to deliver a shock to the learner whenever the latter gave an incorrect answer to a question. With each incorrect response, shock intensity increased. At predetermined voltage levels, the learner (usually in a separate room) either banged on the adjoining wall, cried out in pain and pleaded with the participant to stop, or complained about a fictitious heart condition. Prior to carrying out the experiments, Milgram and Yale   students whom he polled about possible outcomes of such a study predicted that only a very small percentage (from 0 to 3 percent) of people would inflict the most-extreme-intensity shock. Hence, Milgram was surprised with the results of early pilot studies, in which most participants continued through to the extreme 450-volt limit. The first official experiments carried out by Milgram in 1961 yielded similar results—26 out of 40 men recruited for the study proved to be fully obedient to the experimenter, delivering shocks through 450 volts. Variations in the experimental design showed that obedience was highest when the learner was in a separate room, as opposed to being in close proximity to the subject (e.g., in the same room or near enough to touch). Subjects persisted in their obedience despite verbally expressing their disapproval of continuing with the shocks. Milgram suspected that subjects struggled to disengage from the experiment because of its   (“slippery slope”) progression—small demands, seemingly  , became increasingly adverse. Subjects also may have been readily conforming, seeing themselves as inferior to the experimenter in their knowledge of learning, or they may have viewed themselves as being free of responsibility, simply carrying out the experimenter’s commands. Although thought-provoking, the experiments and their findings were highly controversial. The situation placed extreme stress on the subjects, some of whom experienced nervous laughter that culminated in seizures. In  , Milgram did not reveal the full truth about the experiments to his subjects, leaving some to think that they really had shocked another person; it was not until many months later that subjects learned the true nature of the experiments. The validity of the findings also was later drawn into question by reports claiming that some participants suspected that they were the subjects being studied, with the aim of the study being to see how far they would obey the experimenter.

It should be noted that taboos in Western   and the immaturity of the social sciences for a long time impeded research concerning human sexual activity, so that by the early 20th century scientific knowledge was largely restricted to individual case histories that had been studied by such European writers as  ,  , and  . By the 1920s, however, the foundations had been laid for the more extensive statistical studies that were conducted before   in the United States. Of the two major organizations for   study, one, the   in Berlin (established in 1897), was destroyed by the Nazis in 1933. The other, the Institute for Sex Research (later renamed  ), begun in 1938 by the American sexologist   at   in Bloomington, undertook the study of human sexual activity. Much of the following discussion rests on the findings of the Institute for Sex Research, which   the most   data available. The only other country for which comprehensive data exist is Sweden. Human sexual activity may conveniently be classified according to the number and   of the participants. There is solitary activity involving only one individual, and there is sociosexual activity involving more than one person. Sociosexual activity is generally divided into heterosexual activity (male with female) and homosexual activity (male with male or female with female). If three or more individuals are involved it is, of course, possible to have heterosexual and homosexual activity simultaneously. In both solitary and sociosexual activity there may be activities that are sufficiently unusual to warrant the label   activity. The term deviant should not be used as a   judgment but simply as indicating that such activity is not common in a particular society. Since human societies differ in their sexual practices, what is deviant in one society may be normal in another. Self-masturbation is self-stimulation with the intention of causing sexual arousal and, generally, orgasm (sexual climax). Most   is done in private as an end in itself but is sometimes practiced to   a sociosexual relationship. Masturbation, generally beginning at or before  , is very common among males, particularly young males, but becomes less frequent or is abandoned when sociosexual activity is available. Consequently, masturbation is most frequent among the unmarried. Fewer females masturbate; in the  , roughly one-half to two-thirds have done so, as compared to nine out of ten males. Females also tend to reduce or discontinue masturbation when they develop sociosexual relationships. There is great individual variation in frequency, so that it is impractical to try to define what range could be considered “normal.” The   persists, despite scientific proof to the contrary, that masturbation is physically harmful. Neither is there evidence that masturbation is immature activity; it is common among adults deprived of sociosexual opportunities. While solitary masturbation does provide pleasure and relief from the tension of sexual excitement, it does not have the same psychological gratification that interaction with another person provides; thus, extremely few people prefer masturbation to sociosexual activity. The psychological significance of masturbation lies in how the individual regards it. For some, it is laden with guilt; for others, it is a release from tension with no emotional content; and for others it is simply another source of pleasure to be enjoyed for its own sake. The majority of males and females have fantasies of some sociosexual activity while they masturbate. The   not infrequently involves idealized sexual partners and activities that the individual has not experienced and even might   in real life. Since the masturbating person is in sole control of the areas that are stimulated, the degree of pressure, and the rapidity of movement, masturbation is often more effective in producing sexual arousal and   than is sociosexual activity, during which the stimulation is determined to some degree by one’s partner. Orgasm in   evidently occurs only in humans. Its causes are not wholly known. The   that it results from the pressure of accumulated   is invalid because not only do nocturnal emissions sometimes occur in males on successive nights, but females experience orgasm in sleep as well. In some cases orgasm in sleep seems a compensatory phenomenon, occurring during times when the individual has been deprived of or   from other sexual activity. In other cases it may result from external stimuli, such as sleeping prone or having night clothing caught between one’s legs. Most orgasms during sleep are accompanied by erotic dreams. A great majority of males experience orgasm in sleep. This almost always begins and is most frequent in adolescence, tending to disappear later in life. Fewer females have orgasm in sleep, and, unlike males, they usually begin having such experience when fully adult. Orgasm in sleep is generally infrequent, seldom exceeding a dozen times per year for males and three or four times a year for the average female. Most sexual arousal does not lead to sexual activity with another individual. Humans are constantly exposed to sexual   when seeing attractive persons and are subjected to sexual themes in advertising and the  . Response to such visual and other stimuli is strongest in adolescence and early adult life and usually gradually declines with advancing age. One of the necessary tasks of growing up is learning to cope with one’s sexual arousal and to achieve some balance between suppression, which can be injurious, and free expression, which can lead to social difficulties. There is great variation among individuals in the strength of   and responsiveness, so this necessary exercise of restraint is correspondingly difficult or easy.

Clinard was one of the first to follow the   research of American criminologist  . In the early 1950s Clinard examined whether black-market offenses carried out during   should be considered white-collar crime. He challenged Sutherland’s differential association theory by arguing that the personality characteristics of black-market offenders were equally likely to explain their behaviours. Clinard later made significant and long-standing contributions to the study of white-collar and corporate crime through his research with American philosopher and criminologist  . Clinard’s early education was at  , and his doctoral training occurred at the famous “Chicago School,” officially the Department of   at the  , where he received a Ph.D. in sociology in 1941. He was a highly distinguished scholar in the   of sociology and the subfield of  . Clinard held academic positions at several universities, including the  , the  , and  . In 1957 he published  , which became a leading textbook in the fields of sociology and criminology. In the latter part of the 20th century, while at the University of Wisconsin– , Clinard worked with   to resolve ongoing definitional disputes, and their efforts resulted in the widely accepted division of white-collar crime into two distinct forms: corporate crime, which occurs on behalf of a corporation and benefits the corporation, and occupational  , which is committed by individuals against their employing organizations, and benefits the individual offender. This typology   the appropriate unit of analysis for white-collar crime research: either the corporation or the individual. As a result, additional white-collar crime research focused on either corporate crime or occupational crime. This did not solve the definitional debates, but at least it added   clarity to the field. A subsequent research contribution made by Clinard resulted from his collaboration with American sociologist  Peter Cleary Yeager on a study that was published in two forms:   (1979) and   (1980). In the Sutherland tradition, Clinard and Yeager examined crimes committed by the 477 largest manufacturing corporations and the 105 largest wholesale, retail, and service corporations in the   in the years 1975 and 1976. In that two-year time frame, these 582 corporations were the target of 1,553 federal cases. The   of the study were staggering: due to the fact that the numbers were based only on cases brought against the corporations, they underestimated the true, total amount of corporate crime. To use the authors’ terms, the findings were merely “the tip of the iceberg.” The results confirmed Sutherland’s principal finding: corporations violate the law with great frequency. The results of these studies continue to provide a valuable   for researchers examining corporate crime. In the course of his long and prominent career, Clinard wrote or cowrote more than 10 books, 40 articles, and 25 book chapters. His awards were numerous, and he was honoured by many leading academic and professional organizations in sociology, criminology, and white-collar crime, including the Academy of Criminal   Sciences, the American Society of Criminology, the American Sociological Association, and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.

(born August 15, 1933,  , New York, U.S.—died December 20, 1984, New York City) American social psychologist known for his controversial and groundbreaking experiments on   to authority. Milgram’s obedience experiments, in addition to other studies that he carried out during his career, generally are considered to have provided important insight into human social behaviour, particularly   and social pressure.    . Milgram was born and raised in the Bronx, the second of three children in a working-class Jewish family. As a youth, he was an exceptional student, with interests in   and the arts. At Queens College (later part of the   [CUNY]), he studied  , in addition to taking courses in art, literature, and music. In 1953, following his third year at the college, he toured Europe and became increasingly interested in  . He was accepted into the graduate program in international affairs at  . However, in 1954, after completing a   in political science at Queens College, Milgram instead began graduate studies in the social relations department at  . At Harvard, Milgram took classes with leading social psychologists of the day, including  ,  , Roger Brown, and  , all of whom greatly influenced the direction of Milgram’s academic career. Of particular interest to Milgram were Asch’s conformity experiments, which showed that individual behaviour can be influenced by  , with individuals conforming to group perspectives, even when choices made by the group are obviously incorrect. Milgram set out to apply Asch’s group technique, with several variations, to the study of conformity on a national level, seeking to explore national  . He focused initially on the   and Norway and later added France, using his connections at Harvard to travel to Oslo and Paris to establish study groups there. He used an auditory task to measure conformity, with participants in closed booths asked to distinguish between the lengths of two tones. Participants also heard the responses of other members of the study group, who supposedly occupied closed booths next to the participant (the group responses were recorded, and the other booths were empty). Milgram’s findings suggested that Americans and Norwegians differed little in conformity rates and that, of the three groups, the French were the least conforming. In 1960, after earning a Ph.D. from Harvard, Milgram accepted a position as assistant professor at  . There he narrowed his research to obedience. Having been acutely aware from his   of his Jewish heritage and the tragedies suffered by Jews in Europe during the  , he was interested in understanding the factors that led people to inflict harm on others. He designed an unprecedented experiment—later known as the  —whereby study subjects, who believed that they were participating in a learning experiment about punishment and  , were instructed by an authority figure (the experimenter) to inflict seemingly painful shocks to a helpless victim (the learner). Both the experimenter and the learner were actors hired by Milgram, and the shocks were simulated via an authentic-appearing shock generator that was equipped with 30 voltage levels, increasing from 15 to 450 volts. Subjects were instructed by the experimenter to deliver a shock to the learner whenever the latter gave an incorrect answer to a question. With each incorrect response, shock intensity increased. At predetermined voltage levels, the learner (usually in a separate room) either banged on the adjoining wall, cried out in pain and pleaded with the participant to stop, or complained about a fictitious heart condition. Prior to carrying out the experiments, Milgram and Yale   students whom he polled about possible outcomes of such a study predicted that only a very small percentage (from 0 to 3 percent) of people would inflict the most-extreme-intensity shock. Hence, Milgram was surprised with the results of early pilot studies, in which most participants continued through to the extreme 450-volt limit. The first official experiments carried out by Milgram in 1961 yielded similar results—26 out of 40 men recruited for the study proved to be fully obedient to the experimenter, delivering shocks through 450 volts. Variations in the experimental design showed that obedience was highest when the learner was in a separate room, as opposed to being in close proximity to the subject (e.g., in the same room or near enough to touch). Subjects persisted in their obedience despite verbally expressing their disapproval of continuing with the shocks. Milgram suspected that subjects struggled to disengage from the experiment because of its   (“slippery slope”) progression—small demands, seemingly  , became increasingly adverse. Subjects also may have been readily conforming, seeing themselves as inferior to the experimenter in their knowledge of learning, or they may have viewed themselves as being free of responsibility, simply carrying out the experimenter’s commands. Although thought-provoking, the experiments and their findings were highly controversial. The situation placed extreme stress on the subjects, some of whom experienced nervous laughter that culminated in seizures. In  , Milgram did not reveal the full truth about the experiments to his subjects, leaving some to think that they really had shocked another person; it was not until many months later that subjects learned the true nature of the experiments. The validity of the findings also was later drawn into question by reports claiming that some participants suspected that they were the subjects being studied, with the aim of the study being to see how far they would obey the experimenter.

The objective of the game is to capture the opponent’s king. A game of chess ends when a player puts the opposing player’s king in a position that cannot avoid capture (checkmate). A game can also be won or lost through concession. A chess match can also end in a draw. This can happen through stalemate, mutual consent, checkmate being impossible to achieve, and in other ways.  Chess first appeared in   about the 6th century CE. By the 10th century it had spread from Asia to the Middle East and Europe.

A brief treatment of digital computers follows. For full treatment,    . A typical digital   has four basic functional elements: (1)  , (2)  , (3)  , and (4)  . Any of a number of devices is used to enter data and program instructions into a computer and to gain access to the results of the processing operation. Common input devices include keyboards and optical scanners; output devices include printers and monitors. The information received by a computer from its input unit is stored in the main memory or, if not for immediate use, in an  . The control unit selects and calls up instructions from the memory in appropriate sequence and relays the proper commands to the appropriate unit. It also synchronizes the varied operating speeds of the input and output devices to that of the arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) so as to ensure the proper movement of data through the entire computer system. The ALU performs the arithmetic and logic   selected to process the incoming data at extremely high speeds—in many cases in nanoseconds (billionths of a second). The main memory, control unit, and ALU together make up the   (CPU) of most digital computer systems, while the input-output devices and   storage units     equipment.     of France and   of Germany invented mechanical digital calculating machines during the 17th century. The English inventor  , however, is generally credited with having conceived the first automatic digital computer. During the 1830s Babbage devised his so-called  , a mechanical device designed to combine basic arithmetic operations with decisions based on its own computations. Babbage’s plans embodied most of the fundamental elements of the modern digital computer. For example, they called for sequential control—i.e., program control that included branching, looping, and both arithmetic and storage units with automatic printout. Babbage’s device, however, was never completed and was forgotten until his writings were rediscovered over a century later. Of great importance in the evolution of the digital computer was the work of the English mathematician and logician  . In various essays written during the mid-1800s, Boole discussed the   between the symbols of algebra and those of logic as used to represent logical forms and syllogisms. His formalism, operating on only 0 and 1, became the basis of what is now called  , on which computer   and procedures are grounded.    , an American mathematician and physicist, is credited with building  , which he constructed from 1939 to 1942 with the assistance of his graduate student  .  Konrad Zuse, a German engineer acting in virtual isolation from developments elsewhere, completed construction in 1941 of the first operational program-controlled calculating   ( ). In 1944   and a group of engineers at   completed work on the  , a machine whose data-processing operations were controlled primarily by electric relays (switching devices). Since the development of the Harvard Mark I, the digital computer has evolved at a rapid pace. The succession of advances in computer equipment, principally in logic circuitry, is often divided into generations, with each generation   a group of machines that share a common  .   In 1946   and  , both of the  , constructed   (an   for  lectronic  umerical  ntegrator  nd  omputer), a digital machine and the first general-purpose, electronic computer. Its computing features were derived from Atanasoff’s machine; both computers included vacuum tubes instead of relays as their active logic elements, a feature that resulted in a significant increase in operating speed. The concept of a stored-program computer was introduced in the mid-1940s, and the idea of storing instruction codes as well as data in an electrically alterable memory was   in   ( lectronic  iscrete  ariable  utomatic  omputer).   The second computer generation began in the late 1950s, when digital machines using   became commercially available. Although this type of   had been invented in 1948, more than 10 years of developmental work was needed to render it a viable   to the  . The small size of the transistor, its greater reliability, and its relatively low power   made it vastly superior to the tube. Its use in   permitted the manufacture of digital systems that were considerably more efficient, smaller, and faster than their first-generation ancestors.   The late 1960s and ’70s witnessed further dramatic advances in computer  . The first was the fabrication of the  , a   containing hundreds of transistors,  , and   on a tiny silicon  . This microcircuit made possible the production of   (large-scale) computers of higher operating speeds, capacity, and reliability at significantly lower cost. Another type of third-generation computer that developed as a result of microelectronics was the  , a machine appreciably smaller than the standard mainframe but powerful enough to control the instruments of an entire scientific laboratory.  The development of   (LSI) enabled hardware manufacturers to pack thousands of transistors and other related components on a single silicon chip about the size of a baby’s fingernail. Such microcircuitry yielded two devices that revolutionized computer technology. The first of these was the  , which is an   circuit that contains all the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry of a central processing unit. Its production resulted in the development of  , systems no larger than portable television sets yet with substantial computing power. The other important device to emerge from LSI circuitry was the  . Consisting of only a few chips, this compact storage device is well suited for use in minicomputers and microcomputers. Moreover, it has found use in an increasing number of mainframes, particularly those designed for high-speed applications, because of its fast-access speed and large storage  . Such compact electronics led in the late 1970s to the development of the  , a digital computer small and inexpensive enough to be used by ordinary consumers. By the beginning of the 1980s integrated circuitry had advanced to   (VLSI). This design and manufacturing technology greatly increased the circuit density of microprocessor, memory, and support chips—i.e., those that serve to interface microprocessors with input-output devices. By the 1990s some VLSI circuits contained more than 3 million transistors on a silicon chip less than 0.3 square inch (2 square cm) in area. The digital computers of the 1980s and ’90s employing LSI and VLSI technologies are frequently referred to as fourth-generation systems. Many of the microcomputers produced during the 1980s were equipped with a single chip on which circuits for processor, memory, and interface functions were integrated. (   .)   The use of personal computers grew through the 1980s and ’90s. The spread of the   in the 1990s brought millions of users onto the  , the worldwide  , and by 2019 about 4.5 billion people, more than half the world’s population, had Internet access.

Content: Chess is one of the oldest and most popular board games. It is played by two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, commonly white and black. The objective of the game is to capture the opponent’s king. A game of chess ends when a player puts the opposing player’s king in a position that cannot avoid capture (checkmate). A game can also be won or lost through concession. A chess match can also end in a draw. This can happen through stalemate, mutual consent, checkmate being impossible to achieve, and in other ways.  Chess first appeared in   about the 6th century CE. By the 10th century it had spread from Asia to the Middle East and Europe. Some regard the game   to be the precursor of modern chess because of the different piece abilities and the win condition being the capture of a singular piece (king).  was the youngest ever chess world champion. In 1985, at just 22 years of age, the Soviet-born grandmaster defeated   to gain this title. Originally, chess was an intellectual diversion among the upper classes. Chess grew further in the 20th century as it became a profession where people competed for a world title and prize money. Today the Internet has accelerated the growth of chess, with chess content widely available via platforms such as YouTube and Twitch. ,  one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, commonly white and black.

Content: Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.  Artificial intelligence (AI) is a  ’s ability to do tasks commonly associated with human intelligence. The term is applied to the project of developing systems endowed with intellectual processes, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Computers can carry out very complex tasks with great proficiency. However, despite advances in computer processing speed and   capacity, as yet no programs can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. Such broad humanlike intelligence is called artificial general intelligence (AGI) or strong AI. The earliest theoretical work on AI was done by British mathematician   in the 1940s, and the first AI   were developed in the early 1950s. With the steady growth of processing power and computer memory since then, in the early 21st century, AI has advanced to the point where programs can classify images (e.g., PReLU-net), master games such as   (AlphaZero), carry on conversations ( ), and create an image from a text prompt (DALL-E). AI has proved helpful to humans in specific tasks, such as medical diagnosis,  , voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots, in which it has attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals. AI also comes with risks, including the potential for workers in some fields to lose their jobs as more tasks become  .

It operates on data, including magnitudes, letters, and symbols, that are expressed in  —i.e., using only the two digits 0 and 1. By counting, comparing, and manipulating these digits or their combinations according to a set of instructions held in its  , a digital computer can perform such tasks as to control industrial processes and regulate the operations of machines; analyze and organize vast amounts of business data; and simulate the behaviour of   systems (e.g., global   patterns and  ) in scientific research. A brief treatment of digital computers follows. For full treatment,    . A typical digital   has four basic functional elements: (1)  , (2)  , (3)  , and (4)  . Any of a number of devices is used to enter data and program instructions into a computer and to gain access to the results of the processing operation. Common input devices include keyboards and optical scanners; output devices include printers and monitors. The information received by a computer from its input unit is stored in the main memory or, if not for immediate use, in an  . The control unit selects and calls up instructions from the memory in appropriate sequence and relays the proper commands to the appropriate unit. It also synchronizes the varied operating speeds of the input and output devices to that of the arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) so as to ensure the proper movement of data through the entire computer system. The ALU performs the arithmetic and logic   selected to process the incoming data at extremely high speeds—in many cases in nanoseconds (billionths of a second). The main memory, control unit, and ALU together make up the   (CPU) of most digital computer systems, while the input-output devices and   storage units     equipment.     of France and   of Germany invented mechanical digital calculating machines during the 17th century. The English inventor  , however, is generally credited with having conceived the first automatic digital computer. During the 1830s Babbage devised his so-called  , a mechanical device designed to combine basic arithmetic operations with decisions based on its own computations. Babbage’s plans embodied most of the fundamental elements of the modern digital computer. For example, they called for sequential control—i.e., program control that included branching, looping, and both arithmetic and storage units with automatic printout. Babbage’s device, however, was never completed and was forgotten until his writings were rediscovered over a century later. Of great importance in the evolution of the digital computer was the work of the English mathematician and logician  . In various essays written during the mid-1800s, Boole discussed the   between the symbols of algebra and those of logic as used to represent logical forms and syllogisms. His formalism, operating on only 0 and 1, became the basis of what is now called  , on which computer   and procedures are grounded.    , an American mathematician and physicist, is credited with building  , which he constructed from 1939 to 1942 with the assistance of his graduate student  .  Konrad Zuse, a German engineer acting in virtual isolation from developments elsewhere, completed construction in 1941 of the first operational program-controlled calculating   ( ). In 1944   and a group of engineers at   completed work on the  , a machine whose data-processing operations were controlled primarily by electric relays (switching devices). Since the development of the Harvard Mark I, the digital computer has evolved at a rapid pace. The succession of advances in computer equipment, principally in logic circuitry, is often divided into generations, with each generation   a group of machines that share a common  .   In 1946   and  , both of the  , constructed   (an   for  lectronic  umerical  ntegrator  nd  omputer), a digital machine and the first general-purpose, electronic computer. Its computing features were derived from Atanasoff’s machine; both computers included vacuum tubes instead of relays as their active logic elements, a feature that resulted in a significant increase in operating speed. The concept of a stored-program computer was introduced in the mid-1940s, and the idea of storing instruction codes as well as data in an electrically alterable memory was   in   ( lectronic  iscrete  ariable  utomatic  omputer).   The second computer generation began in the late 1950s, when digital machines using   became commercially available. Although this type of   had been invented in 1948, more than 10 years of developmental work was needed to render it a viable   to the  . The small size of the transistor, its greater reliability, and its relatively low power   made it vastly superior to the tube. Its use in   permitted the manufacture of digital systems that were considerably more efficient, smaller, and faster than their first-generation ancestors.   The late 1960s and ’70s witnessed further dramatic advances in computer  . The first was the fabrication of the  , a   containing hundreds of transistors,  , and   on a tiny silicon  . This microcircuit made possible the production of   (large-scale) computers of higher operating speeds, capacity, and reliability at significantly lower cost. Another type of third-generation computer that developed as a result of microelectronics was the  , a machine appreciably smaller than the standard mainframe but powerful enough to control the instruments of an entire scientific laboratory.  The development of   (LSI) enabled hardware manufacturers to pack thousands of transistors and other related components on a single silicon chip about the size of a baby’s fingernail.

However, the question of what, exactly, defines human intelligence is contested, particularly among researchers of  , though there is broader agreement that intelligence consists of multiple processes, rather than being a single ability. There is a long history of efforts to measure human intelligence.
